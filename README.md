| **[Multilingual Multimodal Software Developer for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08719v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[LLMCup: Ranking-Enhanced Comment Updating with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08671v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While comments are essential for enhancing code readability and maintainability in modern software projects, developers are often motivated to update code but not comments, leading to outdated or inconsistent documentation that hinders future understanding and maintenance. Recent approaches such as CUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural sequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these methods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating, resulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update scenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging large language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in software engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and program repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic behind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment updating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on each update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel comment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies to provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a ranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy, 10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in SentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated by LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance of incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Text2BIM: Generating Building Models Using a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08054v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools. This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting.

| **[NL in the Middle: Code Translation with LLMs and Intermediate Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08627v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies show that large language models (LLMs) produce buggy code translations. One avenue to improve translation accuracy is through intermediate representations, which could provide structured insights to guide the model's understanding. We explore whether code translation using LLMs can benefit from intermediate representations via natural language (NL) and abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open Gpt4 8X7B and specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful translations for the best-performing model (Open Gpt4 8X7B) compared to the zero-shot prompt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Proto-Personas through Prompt Engineering: A Case Study on Efficiency, Effectiveness and Empathy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08594v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment. However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance, and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages; 2 figures; Preprint with the original submission accepted for publication at 39th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)</p></details> |
| **[InferLog: Accelerating LLM Inference for Online Log Parsing via ICL-oriented Prefix Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08523v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs, necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Tool for Supporting Debugging and Understanding of Normative Requirements Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05504v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Investigation into Maintenance Support for Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05245v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential for neural networks to augment our daily lives grows, ensuring their quality through effective testing, debugging, and maintenance is essential. This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal verification offers strong assurances of software correctness. However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge graphs, our approach aims to reduce hallucinations and increase the factual accuracy of generated responses. The system provides an interactive experience similar to ChatGPT, tailored specifically for ReservoirPy, enabling users to write, debug, and understand Python code while accessing reliable domain-specific insights. In our evaluation, while proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o and NotebookLM performed slightly better on general knowledge questions, our model outperformed them on coding tasks and showed a significant improvement over its base model, Codestral-22B.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03156v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/15788502.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[iPanda: An Intelligent Protocol Testing and Debugging Agent for Conformance Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00378v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformance testing is essential for ensuring that protocol implementations comply with their specifications. However, traditional testing approaches involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities, providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Deduplicating Compiler Bugs with Bisection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It allows verifying that the students correctly apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students' misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g., no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to configure. To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CompEd'25, 7 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[$T^3$: Multi-level Tree-based Automatic Program Repair with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21211v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks, establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

| **[LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Intelligent Refactoring of Haskell Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19481v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refactoring is a constant activity in software development and maintenance. Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Guided Self-Debugging Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02928v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code generation is gaining significant importance in intelligent computer programming and system deployment. However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |
| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Challenges and Practices in Quantum Software Testing and Debugging: Insights from Practitioners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17306v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum software engineering is an emerging discipline with distinct challenges, particularly in testing and debugging. As quantum computing transitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present in classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited observability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific tools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software developers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews focused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants reported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing (54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31% reported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual methods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies, such as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which respondents noted do not scale well. The most frequently cited sources of bugs were classical in nature-library updates (81%), developer mistakes (68%), and compatibility issues (62%)-often worsened by limited abstraction in existing SDKs. These findings highlight the urgent need for better-aligned testing and debugging tools, integrated more seamlessly into the workflows of quantum developers. We present these results in detail and offer actionable recommendations grounded in the real-world needs of practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[MLDebugging: Towards Benchmarking Code Debugging Across Multi-Library Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13824v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code debugging is a crucial task in software engineering, which attracts increasing attention. While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios. We hope this work can uncover the potential of LLMs in multi-library debugging scenario and offer insights for future research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Hessian-Based Insights Support Fault Diagnosis in Attention-based Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07871v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity, diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis) and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |

However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software.

| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Identify Flakiness in C++ Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12340v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of regression testing in software testing is crucial as it ensures that any new modifications do not disrupt the existing functionality and behaviour of the software system. The desired outcome is for regression tests to yield identical results without any modifications made to the system being tested. In practice, however, the presence of Flaky Tests introduces non-deterministic behaviour and undermines the reliability of regression testing results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for identifying the root cause of flaky tests in C++ projects at the code level, with the intention of assisting developers in debugging and resolving them more efficiently. We compile a comprehensive collection of C++ project flaky tests sourced from GitHub repositories. We fine-tune Mistral-7b, Llama2-7b and CodeLlama-7b models on the C++ dataset and an existing Java dataset and evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We assess the performance of the models across various datasets and offer recommendations for both research and industry applications. The results indicate that our models exhibit varying performance on the C++ dataset, while their performance is comparable to that of the Java dataset. The Mistral-7b surpasses the other two models regarding all metrics, achieving a score of 1. Our results demonstrate the exceptional capability of LLMs to accurately classify flakiness in C++ and Java projects, providing a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of debugging flaky tests in practice.</p></details> |  |

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM-Based Fault Localization with External Memory and Project Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03585v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 7 figures |

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

However, existing debuggers are primarily tailored for human interaction, and those designed for programmatic debugging focus on kernel space, resulting in limited functionality in userland. To fill this gap, we introduce libdebug, a Python library for programmatic debugging of userland binary executables. libdebug offers a user-friendly API that enables developers to build custom debugging tools for various applications, including software engineering, reverse engineering, and software security. It is released as an open-source project, along with comprehensive documentation to encourage use and collaboration across the community. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of libdebug through case studies and benchmarks, all of which are publicly available. We find that the median latency of syscall and breakpoint handling in libdebug is 3 to 4 times lower compared to that of GDB.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |

LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

This work introduces JITScope, an interactive visualization framework that illustrates how IR nodes and instructions evolve across compilation phases. The system features a full-stack architecture: a Python-based backend transforms raw JSON-formatted IR data-representing an abstract model of the JIT compiler IR-into a normalized SQLite database; a controller layer serves processed CSV data; and a D3.js-powered frontend renders an interactive, phase-aware graph of IR node transformations. The design emphasizes modularity, traceability, and flexibility. Our roadmap explores intuitive visual representations of phase-level changes in IR node connectivity, values, and access patterns. Ultimately, JITScope lays a foundation for future tooling that enables visual exploration of IR evolution, including phase filtering, value tracking, and function-access mapping-offering a new lens into the behaviors and impacts of compiler optimizations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 8 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

The chapter considers a debugging process in which a program is tested against different test cases. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test case. The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software, GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a unique corresponding event handler.</p></details> |  |

Virtual Platforms (VPs) have become indispensable tools for this purpose as they serve as a platform to execute and debug the unmodified target software at an early design stage. With the increasing complexity of software, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, VPs need to provide high simulation speed to ensure the target software executes within a reasonable time. Hybrid simulation, which combines virtual models with real hardware, can improve the performance of VPs. This paper introduces a novel approach for integrating real Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices into SystemC-TLM-2.0-based VPs. The embedded PCI devices enable high performance, easy integration, and allow introspection for analysis and optimization. To illustrate the practical application of our approach, we present a case study where we integrate Google Coral's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) into an ARM-based VP. The integration allows efficient execution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while eliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating AI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression testing across architectures, and device communication analysis.

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Better Understanding of Probabilistic Delta Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04735v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.</p></details> | accepted by ICSE25 |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.</p></details> |  |

Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To realize this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited availability of quantum computer hardware, high computational demands of simulating quantum computers on classical systems, and complicated technology stack to enable currently available accelerators into development environments. These limitations make it difficult for the developer to create an efficient workflow for quantum software development. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote hardware and offering speedup in execution with simulator surroundings. The goal is to allow the development of more complex circuits and to support an iterative software development approach. In our experiment, with the solution presented in this paper, we have obtained up to 5 times faster circuit execution runtime, and enabled qubit ranges from 21 to 29 qubits with a simple plug-and-play kernel for the Jupyter notebook.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.06756</p></details> |
| **[PromiseTune: Unveiling Causally Promising and Explainable Configuration Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05995v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high configurability of modern software systems has made configuration tuning a crucial step for assuring system performance, e.g., latency or throughput. However, given the expensive measurements, large configuration space, and rugged configuration landscape, existing tuners suffer ineffectiveness due to the difficult balance of budget utilization between exploring uncertain regions (for escaping from local optima) and exploiting guidance of known good configurations (for fast convergence). The root cause is that we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes challenges in the explainability of the results. In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by causally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn rules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify them with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated reflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these places in the landscape. This, as we demonstrate, can effectively mitigate the impact of the exploration and exploitation trade-off. Those purified regions can then be paired with the measured configurations to provide spatial explainability at the landscape level. Comparing with 11 state-of-the-art tuners on 12 systems and varying budgets, we show that PromiseTune performs significantly better than the others with 42% superior rank to the overall second best while providing richer information to explain the hidden system characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICSE26</p></details> |
| **[Robust Containerization of the High Angular Resolution Functional Imaging (HARFI) Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07010v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain has focused primarily on gray matter, particularly the cortical gray matter and associated nuclei. However, recent work has demonstrated that functional activity in white matter also plays a meaningful role in both cognition and learning. In previous work, we introduced the High Angular Resolution Functional Imaging (HARFI) pipeline, which demonstrated both local and global patterns of functional correlation in white matter. Notably, HARFI enabled exploration of asymmetric voxel-wise correlation using odd-order spherical harmonics. Although the original implementation of HARFI was released via GitHub, adoption was limited due to the technical complexity of running the source code. In this work, we present a robust and efficient containerized version of the HARFI pipeline, enabling seamless execution across multiple public datasets. Our goal is to facilitate broader and deeper exploration of functional white matter architecture, especially through the lens of high angular resolution functional correlations. The key innovation of this work is the containerized implementation, which we have made available under a permissive open-source license to support reproducible and accessible research practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Issue Tracking Ecosystems: Context and Best Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06704v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue Tracking Systems (ITSs), such as GitHub and Jira, are popular tools that support Software Engineering (SE) organisations through the management of ``issues'', which represent different SE artefacts such as requirements, development tasks, and maintenance items. ITSs also support internal linking between issues, and external linking to other tools and information sources. This provides SE organisations key forms of documentation, including forwards and backwards traceability (e.g., Feature Requests linked to sprint releases and code commits linked to Bug Reports). An Issue Tracking Ecosystem (ITE) is the aggregate of the central ITS and the related SE artefacts, stakeholders, and processes -- with an emphasis on how these contextual factors interact with the ITS. The quality of ITEs is central to the success of these organisations and their software products. There are challenges, however, within ITEs, including complex networks of interlinked artefacts and diverse workflows. While ITSs have been the subject of study in SE research for decades, ITEs as a whole need further exploration. In this thesis, I undertake the challenge of understanding ITEs at a broader level, addressing these questions regarding complexity and diversity. I interviewed practitioners and performed archival analysis on a diverse set of ITSs. These analyses revealed the context-dependent nature of ITE problems, highlighting the need for context-specific ITE research. While previous work has produced many solutions to specific ITS problems, these solutions are not consistently framed in a context-rich and comparable way, leading to a desire for more aligned solutions across research and practice. To address this emergent information and lack of alignment, I created the Best Practice Ontology for ITEs. <... truncated due to arXiv abstract character limit ...></p></details> | <details><summary>300 p...</summary><p>300 pages, Dissertation for the doctoral degree Dr. rer. nat. at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Natural Sciences, Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany</p></details> |
| **[Finding Compiler Bugs through Cross-Language Code Generator and Differential Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06584v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compilers play a central role in translating high-level code into executable programs, making their correctness essential for ensuring code safety and reliability. While extensive research has focused on verifying the correctness of compilers for single-language compilation, the correctness of cross-language compilation - which involves the interaction between two languages and their respective compilers - remains largely unexplored. To fill this research gap, we propose CrossLangFuzzer, a novel framework that introduces a universal intermediate representation (IR) for JVM-based languages and automatically generates cross-language test programs with diverse type parameters and complex inheritance structures. After generating the initial IR, CrossLangFuzzer applies three mutation techniques - LangShuffler, FunctionRemoval, and TypeChanger - to enhance program diversity. By evaluating both the original and mutated programs across multiple compiler versions, CrossLangFuzzer successfully uncovered 10 confirmed bugs in the Kotlin compiler, 4 confirmed bugs in the Groovy compiler, 7 confirmed bugs in the Scala 3 compiler, 2 confirmed bugs in the Scala 2 compiler, and 1 confirmed bug in the Java compiler. Among all mutators, TypeChanger is the most effective, detecting 11 of the 24 compiler bugs. Furthermore, we analyze the symptoms and root causes of cross-compilation bugs, examining the respective responsibilities of language compilers when incorrect behavior occurs during cross-language compilation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork specifically focused on identifying and diagnosing compiler bugs in cross-language compilation scenarios. Our research helps to understand these challenges and contributes to improving compiler correctness in multi-language environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 40th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA)</p></details> |

Our underlying frequency estimation routine works within the framework of differential privacy. The design philosophy follows a client-server architecture. Furthermore, the system uses a local differential privacy scheme where data gets randomized on the client before submitting the request to the resource server. This scheme allows for data analysis on de-identified data by carefully adding noise to prevent re-identification attacks, thereby facilitating public data release without compromising the identifiability of the individual record. This work further enhances privacy guarantees by leveraging Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) to achieve increased privacy protection for data in transit that addresses pre-existing privacy vulnerabilities in raw HTTP. We provide an implementation that focuses on frequency estimation with a histogram of a known dictionary. Our resulting formulation based on OHTTP has provided stricter privacy safeguards when compared to trusting an organization to manually delete identifying information from the client's request in the ingestor as deployed in reference work~\cite{apple2017}.

We present cuVSLAM, a state-of-the-art solution for visual simultaneous localization and mapping, which can operate with a variety of visual-inertial sensor suites, including multiple RGB and depth cameras, and inertial measurement units. cuVSLAM supports operation with as few as one RGB camera to as many as 32 cameras, in arbitrary geometric configurations, thus supporting a wide range of robotic setups. cuVSLAM is specifically optimized using CUDA to deploy in real-time applications with minimal computational overhead on edge-computing devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson. We present the design and implementation of cuVSLAM, example use cases, and empirical results on several state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrating the best-in-class performance of cuVSLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContractTrace: Retracing Smart Contract Versions for Security Analyses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20866v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the inherent immutability of blockchain technology, smart contract updates require their deployment at new addresses rather than modifying existing ones, thus fragmenting version histories and creating critical blind spots for analyses. Indeed, for example, this fragmentation severely hinders security researchers ability to track vulnerability lifecycles across contract versions. While platforms like Etherscan provide detailed information about Ethereum smart contracts, they lack crucial functionality to trace predecessor-successor relationships within smart contract lineages, preventing systematic analysis of how vulnerabilities emerge, propagate, and potentially remain unresolved across versions.To address the challenge of tracing smart contract lineages, we adopt a Design Science Research (DSR) approach and introduce ContractTrace, an automated infrastructure that accurately identifies and links versions of smart contracts into coherent lineages. This tool enables the construction of lineageSet, an up-to-date, open-source dataset specifically designed to support security research on vulnerability, defect or any other property evolution patterns in smart contracts. Through a security-focused case study we demonstrate how ContractTrace reveals previously obscured vulnerability life-cycles within smart contract lineages, tracking whether critical security flaws persist or get resolved across versions. This capability is essential for understanding vulnerability propagation patterns and evaluating the effectiveness of security patches in blockchain environments. In the evaluation phase of our DSR approach, we validated our lineage detection methodology against an alternative approach using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to cluster contract versions, confirming the security relevance and accuracy of our technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[LLMCup: Ranking-Enhanced Comment Updating with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08671v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While comments are essential for enhancing code readability and maintainability in modern software projects, developers are often motivated to update code but not comments, leading to outdated or inconsistent documentation that hinders future understanding and maintenance. Recent approaches such as CUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural sequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these methods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating, resulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update scenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging large language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in software engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and program repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic behind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment updating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on each update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel comment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies to provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a ranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy, 10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in SentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated by LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance of incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Computing Floating-Point Errors by Injecting Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08467v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Floating-point programs form the foundation of modern science and engineering, providing the essential computational framework for a wide range of applications, such as safety-critical systems, aerospace engineering, and financial analysis. Floating-point errors can lead to severe consequences. Although floating-point errors widely exist, only a subset of inputs may trigger significant errors in floating-point programs. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend to take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for detecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1) difficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time. The two recent tools, ATOMU and FPCC, can partially address these issues. However, ATOMU suffers from false positives; while FPCC, though eliminating false positives, operates at a considerably slower speed. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel approach named PI-detector to computing floating-point errors effectively and efficiently. Our approach is based on the observation that floating-point errors stem from large condition numbers in atomic operations (such as addition and subtraction), which then propagate and accumulate. PI-detector injects small perturbations into the operands of individual atomic operations within the program and compares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to compute floating-point errors. We evaluate PI-detector with datasets from ATOMU and HSED, as well as a complex linear system-solving program. Experimental results demonstrate that PI-detector can perform efficient and accurate floating-point error computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.20804</p></details> |

In fact, in many cases, the tools can indeed determine what is engineerable. In fusion and fission1 energy engineering, software has become the dominant tool for design. For that reason, in 2024, for the first time ever, we asked 103 computational scientists developing the codes used in fusion and fission energy about the problems they are attempting to solve with their codes, the tools available to them to solve them, and their end to end developer experience with said tools. The results revealed a changing tide in software tools in fusion and fission, with more and more computational scientists preferring modern programming languages, open-source codes, and modular software. These trends represent a peek into what will happen 5 to 10 years in the future of nuclear engineering. Since the majority of our respondents belonged to US national labs and universities, these results hint at the most cutting-edge trends in the industry. The insights included in the State of Computational Science in Fission and Fusion Energy indicate a dramatic shift toward multiphysics codes, a drop-off in the use of FORTRAN in favor of more modern languages like Python and C++, and ever-rising budgets for code development, at times reaching $50M in a single organization. Our survey paints a future of nuclear engineering codes that is modular in nature, small in terms of compute, and increasingly prioritized by organizations.

The feasibility of this vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to automating requirements-centric SE tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering (RE) conference</p></details> |
| **[HLSTester: Efficient Testing of Behavioral Discrepancies with LLMs for High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14641v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In high-level synthesis (HLS), C/C++ programs with synthesis directives are used to generate circuits for FPGA implementations. However, hardware-specific and platform-dependent characteristics in these implementations can introduce behavioral discrepancies between the original C/C++ programs and the circuits after high-level synthesis. Existing methods for testing behavioral discrepancies in HLS are still immature, and the testing workflow requires significant human efforts. To address this challenge, we propose HLSTester, a large language model (LLM) aided testing framework that efficiently detects behavioral discrepancies in HLS. To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs and enhance prompt quality, the testbenches for original C/C++ programs are leveraged to guide LLMs in generating HLS-compatible testbenches, effectively eliminating certain traditional C/C++ constructs that are incompatible with HLS tools. Key variables are pinpointed through a backward slicing technique in both C/C++ and HLS programs to monitor their runtime spectra, enabling an in-depth analysis of the discrepancy symptoms. To reduce test time, a testing input generation mechanism is introduced to integrate dynamic mutation with insights from an LLM-based progressive reasoning chain. In addition, repetitive hardware testing is skipped by a redundancy-aware filtering technique for the generated test inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-aided testing framework significantly accelerates the testing workflow while achieving higher testbench simulation pass rates compared with the traditional method and the direct use of LLMs on the same HLS programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.03889</p></details> |

So far LLMgCode has more quality issues than human-authored code (HaCode). It is common for LLMgCode to mix with HaCode in a code change, while the change is signed by only human developers, without being carefully examined. Many automated methods have been proposed to detect LLMgCode from HaCode, in which the perplexity-based method (PERPLEXITY for short) is the state-of-the-art method. However, the efficacy evaluation of PERPLEXITY has focused on detection accuracy. Yet it is unclear whether PERPLEXITY is good enough in a wider range of realistic evaluation settings. To this end, we carry out a family of experiments to compare PERPLEXITY against feature- and pre-training-based methods from three perspectives: detection accuracy, detection speed, and generalization capability. The experimental results show that PERPLEXITY has the best generalization capability while having limited detection accuracy and detection speed. Based on that, we discuss the strengths and limitations of PERPLEXITY, e.g., PERPLEXITY is unsuitable for high-level programming languages. Finally, we provide recommendations to improve PERPLEXITY and apply it in practice. As the first large-scale investigation on detecting LLMgCode from HaCode, this article provides a wide range of findings for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

SLMs offer lightweight and cost-effective alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), making them attractive for use in resource-constrained environments. However, empirical understanding of SLMs, particularly their capabilities, limitations, and performance trade-offs in code generation remains limited. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 20 open-source SLMs ranging from 0.4B to 10B parameters on five diverse code-related benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, Mercury, HumanEvalPack, and CodeXGLUE). The models are assessed along three dimensions: i) functional correctness of generated code, ii) computational efficiency and iii) performance across multiple programming languages. The findings of this study reveal that several compact SLMs achieve competitive results while maintaining a balance between performance and efficiency, making them viable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, achieving further improvements in accuracy requires switching to larger models. These models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, but they require much more computational power. We observe that for 10% performance improvements, models can require nearly a 4x increase in VRAM consumption, highlighting a trade-off between effectiveness and scalability. Besides, the multilingual performance analysis reveals that SLMs tend to perform better in languages such as Python, Java, and PHP, while exhibiting relatively weaker performance in Go, C++, and Ruby. However, statistical analysis suggests these differences are not significant, indicating a generalizability of SLMs across programming languages. Based on the findings, this work provides insights into the design and selection of SLMs for real-world code generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 Tables, 57 figures.

However, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e., they generate text which sounds plausible but is incorrect. Although there has been a recent surge in research on LLM hallucinations for text generation, similar hallucination phenomenon can happen in code generation. Sometimes the generated code can have syntactical or logical errors as well as more advanced issues like security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, etc. Given the wide adaptation of LLMs to enhance efficiency in code generation and development in general, it becomes imperative to investigate hallucinations in code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at studying hallucinations in the code generated by LLMs. We start by introducing the code hallucination definition and a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucination types. We propose the first benchmark CodeMirage dataset for code hallucinations. The benchmark contains 1,137 GPT-3.5 generated hallucinated code snippets for Python programming problems from two base datasets - HumanEval and MBPP. We then propose the methodology for code hallucination detection and experiment with open source LLMs such as CodeLLaMA as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models using one-shot prompt. We find that GPT-4 performs the best on HumanEval dataset and gives comparable results to the fine-tuned CodeBERT baseline on MBPP dataset. Towards the end, we discuss various mitigation strategies for code hallucinations and conclude our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AutoMates @ IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2 operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world environments with diverse corruptions.</p></details> |  |

However, limitations of LLMs such as irrelevant or incorrect code have highlighted the need for prompt programming (or prompt engineering) where engineers apply specific prompt techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought or input-output examples) to improve the generated code. While some prompt techniques have been studied, the impact of different techniques -- and their interactions -- on code generation is still not fully understood. In this study, we introduce CodePromptEval, a dataset of 7072 prompts designed to evaluate five prompt techniques (few-shot, persona, chain-of-thought, function signature, list of packages) and their effect on the correctness, similarity, and quality of complete functions generated by three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3, and Mistral). Our findings show that while certain prompt techniques significantly influence the generated code, combining multiple techniques does not necessarily improve the outcome. Additionally, we observed a trade-off between correctness and quality when using prompt techniques.

| **[Towards Exception Safety Code Generation with Intermediate Representation Agents Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06949v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with robust exception handling in generated code, leading to fragile programs that are prone to runtime errors. We propose Seeker, a novel multi-agent framework that enforces exception safety in LLM generated code through an Intermediate Representation (IR) approach. Seeker decomposes exception handling into five specialized agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler that collaboratively analyze code, detect fragile segments, retrieve best practice exception strategies, and inject robust handling code. We also introduce Common Exception Enumeration (CEE), a comprehensive knowledge base derived from official documentation, technical practices, and real world code, to standardize exception handling strategies. Seeker also incorporates a Deep Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Deep RAG) algorithm to efficiently navigate the exception inheritance hierarchy, cutting down search overhead by 93% while improving accuracy in identifying relevant exceptions. We evaluate Seeker on 15 open source Java projects and multiple benchmarks. Seeker outperforms state of the art baselines, improving exception handling precision by up to 37% and overall code robustness by 38% as measured by expert code review. It significantly closes the gap between LLM and human developers in exception management, achieving a 28% success rate on real world issue fixes (SWE bench) versus 19% by prior methods. Our framework preserves functional correctness of code while proactively handling errors, demonstrating a practical, generalizable solution for safer code generation. In this paper, we discuss the novelty of using intermediate representation and multi-agent collaboration for exception handling, and outline how Seeker can be extended to other programming languages and complex software engineering tasks, aligning LLM-generated code with industrial standard.</p></details> |  |

Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in functional components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. In this paper, we formalize the semantics of the essence of React Hooks we name React-tRace, providing a framework that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted to OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[AI for the Routine, Humans for the Complex: Accuracy-Driven Data Labelling with Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just 1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language models, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable alternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2) student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact, efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable methodology to foster broader access to generative AI capabilities in educational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

Initially embraced by the computer science community, the versatility of LLMs has found its way into diverse domains. In particular, the software engineering realm has witnessed the most transformative changes. With LLMs increasingly serving as AI Pair Programming Assistants spurred the development of specialized models aimed at aiding software engineers. Although this new paradigm offers numerous advantages, it also presents critical challenges and open problems. To identify the potential and prevailing obstacles, we systematically reviewed contemporary scholarly publications, emphasizing the perspectives of software developers and usability concerns. Preliminary findings underscore pressing concerns about data privacy, bias, and misinformation. Additionally, we identified several usability challenges, including prompt engineering, increased cognitive demands, and mistrust.

Popular options include being able to write in general-purpose programming languages like Rust from Risc Zero. Other languages exist like Circom, Lib-snark, and Cairo. However, developers entering the ZK space are faced with many different ZK backends to choose from, leading to a steep learning curve and a fragmented developer experience across different platforms. As a result, many developers tend to select a single ZK backend and remain tied to it. This thesis introduces zkSDK, a modular framework that streamlines ZK application development by abstracting the backend complexities. At the core of zkSDK is Presto, a custom Python-like programming language that enables the profiling and analysis of a program to assess its computational workload intensity. Combined with user-defined criteria, zkSDK employs a dynamic selection algorithm to automatically choose the optimal ZK-proving backend. Through an in-depth analysis and evaluation of real-world workloads, we demonstrate that zkSDK effectively selects the best-suited backend from a set of supported ZK backends, delivering a seamless and user-friendly development experience.</p></details> | undergrad thesis |

However, concerns about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures. We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software engineering tasks. We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for each, and finally went through a short exit interview. Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant difference only in EDA phasic peaks. We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.</p></details> |  |
| **[RVISmith: Fuzzing Compilers for RVV Intrinsics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03773v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern processors are equipped with single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions for fine-grained data parallelism. Compiler auto-vectorization techniques that target SIMD instructions face performance limitations due to insufficient information available at compile time, requiring programmers to manually manipulate SIMD instructions. SIMD intrinsics, a type of built-in function provided by modern compilers, enable programmers to manipulate SIMD instructions within high-level programming languages. Bugs in compilers for SIMD intrinsics can introduce potential threats to software security, producing unintended calculation results, data loss, program crashes, etc. To detect bugs in compilers for SIMD intrinsics, we propose RVISmith, a randomized fuzzer that generates well-defined C programs that include various invocation sequences of RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension) intrinsics. We design RVISmith to achieve the following objectives: (i) achieving high intrinsic coverage, (ii) improving sequence variety, and (iii) without known undefined behaviors. We implement RVISmith based on the ratified RVV intrinsic specification and evaluate our approach with three modern compilers: GCC, LLVM, and XuanTie. Experimental results show that RVISmith achieves 11.5 times higher intrinsic coverage than the state-of-the-art fuzzer for RVV intrinsics. By differential testing that compares results across different compilers, optimizations, and equivalent programs, we detect and report 13 previously unknown bugs of the three compilers under test to date. Of these bugs, 10 are confirmed and another 3 are fixed by the compiler developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |

However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACE: Automated Technical Debt Remediation with Validated Large Language Model Refactorings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03536v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable advances in AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled machines to write code, accelerating the growth of software systems. However, the bottleneck in software development is not writing code but understanding it; program understanding is the dominant activity, consuming approximately 70% of developers' time. This implies that improving existing code to make it easier to understand has a high payoff and - in the age of AI-assisted coding - is an essential activity to ensure that a limited pool of developers can keep up with ever-growing codebases. This paper introduces Augmented Code Engineering (ACE), a tool that automates code improvements using validated LLM output. Developed through a data-driven approach, ACE provides reliable refactoring suggestions by considering both objective code quality improvements and program correctness. Early feedback from users suggests that AI-enabled refactoring helps mitigate code-level technical debt that otherwise rarely gets acted upon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Integrated Development Environments (AI-IDE) (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Securing Mixed Rust with Hardware Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03344v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Rust programming language enforces three basic Rust principles, namely ownership, borrowing, and AXM (Aliasing Xor Mutability) to prevent security bugs such as memory safety violations and data races. However, Rust projects often have mixed code, i.e., code that also uses unsafe Rust, FFI (Foreign Function Interfaces), and inline assembly for low-level control. The Rust compiler is unable to statically enforce Rust principles in mixed Rust code which can lead to many security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose CapsLock, a security enforcement mechanism that can run at the level of machine code and detect Rust principle violations at run-time in mixed code. CapsLock is kept simple enough to be implemented into recent capability-based hardware abstractions that provide low-cost spatial memory safety. CapsLock introduces a novel revoke-on-use abstraction for capability-based designs, wherein accessing a memory object via a capability implicitly invalidates certain other capabilities pointing to it, thereby also providing temporal memory safety automatically, without requiring software to explicitly specify such invalidation. Thus, CapsLock is the first mechanism capable of providing cross-language enforcement of Rust principles. We implemented a prototype of CapsLock on QEMU. Evaluation results show that CapsLock is highly compatible with existing Rust code (passing 99.7% of the built-in test cases of the 100 most popular crates) and flags Rust principle violations in real-world Rust projects that use FFI or inline assembly. We discovered 8 previously unknown bugs in such crates in our experiments.</p></details> | To appear at CCS '25 |

To mitigate the problem, substantial efforts have been devoted to understanding its characteristics and recommending alternative libraries, especially for programming language (PL) ecosystems with a central package hosting platform, such as Python (PyPI). However, to the best of our knowledge, understanding of C/C++ library migrations is still lacking, possibly due to challenges resulting from the fragmented and complicated dependency management practices in the C/C++ ecosystem. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper analyzes 19,943 C/C++ projects that utilize different package management tools and establishes the first C/C++ library migration dataset. Based on the dataset, we investigate the prevalence, domains, target library, and rationale of C/C++ library migrations and compare the results with three widely investigated PLs: Python, JavaScript, and Java. We find that the overall trend in the number of C/C++ library migrations is similar to Java. Migrations across different package management tools are also observed. In C/C++, library migrations mainly occur in GUI, Build, and OS development, but are rare in domains (e.g., Testing and Logging) that dominate library migrations in the three compared PLs. 83.46\% of C/C++ source libraries only have one migration target, suggesting that our library migration dataset could be used directly to recommend migration targets. We find four C/C++-specific migration reasons, such as less compile time and unification of dependency management, revealing the unique dependency management requirements in C/C++ projects. We believe our findings can help C/C++ developers make more informed library migration decisions and shed light on the design of C/C++ library migration tools.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dually Hierarchical Drift Adaptation for Online Configuration Performance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08730v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[LLMCup: Ranking-Enhanced Comment Updating with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08671v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While comments are essential for enhancing code readability and maintainability in modern software projects, developers are often motivated to update code but not comments, leading to outdated or inconsistent documentation that hinders future understanding and maintenance. Recent approaches such as CUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural sequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these methods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating, resulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update scenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging large language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in software engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and program repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic behind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment updating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on each update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel comment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies to provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a ranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy, 10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in SentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated by LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance of incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting.

One avenue to improve translation accuracy is through intermediate representations, which could provide structured insights to guide the model's understanding. We explore whether code translation using LLMs can benefit from intermediate representations via natural language (NL) and abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open Gpt4 8X7B and specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful translations for the best-performing model (Open Gpt4 8X7B) compared to the zero-shot prompt.</p></details> |  |

However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance, and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages; 2 figures; Preprint with the original submission accepted for publication at 39th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computing Floating-Point Errors by Injecting Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08467v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Floating-point programs form the foundation of modern science and engineering, providing the essential computational framework for a wide range of applications, such as safety-critical systems, aerospace engineering, and financial analysis. Floating-point errors can lead to severe consequences. Although floating-point errors widely exist, only a subset of inputs may trigger significant errors in floating-point programs. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend to take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for detecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1) difficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time. The two recent tools, ATOMU and FPCC, can partially address these issues. However, ATOMU suffers from false positives; while FPCC, though eliminating false positives, operates at a considerably slower speed. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel approach named PI-detector to computing floating-point errors effectively and efficiently. Our approach is based on the observation that floating-point errors stem from large condition numbers in atomic operations (such as addition and subtraction), which then propagate and accumulate. PI-detector injects small perturbations into the operands of individual atomic operations within the program and compares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to compute floating-point errors. We evaluate PI-detector with datasets from ATOMU and HSED, as well as a complex linear system-solving program. Experimental results demonstrate that PI-detector can perform efficient and accurate floating-point error computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.20804</p></details> |

Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to make their performance competitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted and accepted at the IEEE QSW 2025.

However, fine-tuning more generalizable classifiers based on existing labeled datasets remains an important challenge, as creating large and accurately labeled datasets often requires considerable time and resources. In this paper, we evaluate the capabilities of four advanced LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70b, to enhance user feedback classification and address the challenge of the limited labeled dataset. To achieve this, we conduct several experiments on eight datasets that have been meticulously labeled in prior research. These datasets include user reviews from app stores, posts from the X platform, and discussions from the public forums, widely recognized as representative sources of app user feedback. We analyze the performance of various LLMs in identifying both fine-grained and coarse-grained user feedback categories. Given the substantial volume of daily user feedback and the computational limitations of LLMs, we leverage these models as an annotation tool to augment labeled datasets with general and app-specific data. This augmentation aims to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art BERT-based classification models. Our findings indicate that LLMs when guided by well-crafted prompts, can effectively classify user feedback into coarse-grained categories. Moreover, augmenting the training dataset with datasets labeled using the consensus of LLMs can significantly enhance classifier performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the current implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN (to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future standardization efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

However, they also raise concerns, particularly the risk that developers may rely heavily on these tools, reducing their understanding of the generated code. We hypothesize that this loss of understanding may be reflected in source code knowledge models, which are used to identify developer expertise. In this work, we present an exploratory analysis of how a knowledge model and a Truck Factor algorithm built upon it can be affected by GenAI usage. To investigate this, we collected statistical data on the integration of ChatGPT-generated code into GitHub projects and simulated various scenarios by adjusting the degree of GenAI contribution. Our findings reveal that most scenarios led to measurable impacts, indicating the sensitivity of current expertise metrics. This suggests that as GenAI becomes more integrated into development workflows, the reliability of such metrics may decrease.</p></details> |  |

How Increasing AI Automation Transforms Developer Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08149v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers now have access to a growing array of increasingly autonomous AI tools to support software development. While numerous studies have examined developer use of copilots, which can provide chat assistance or code completions, evaluations of coding agents, which can automatically write files and run code, still largely rely on static benchmarks without humans-in-the-loop. In this work, we conduct the first academic study to explore developer interactions with coding agents and characterize how more autonomous AI tools affect user productivity and experience, compared to existing copilots. We evaluate two leading copilot and agentic coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and OpenHands, recruiting participants who regularly use the former. Our results show agents have the potential to assist developers in ways that surpass copilots (e.g., completing tasks that humans might not have accomplished before) and reduce the user effort required to complete tasks. However, there are challenges involved in enabling their broader adoption, including how to ensure users have an adequate understanding of agent behaviors. Our results not only provide insights into how developer workflows change as a result of coding agents but also highlight how user interactions with agents differ from those with existing copilots, motivating a set of recommendations for researchers building new agents. Given the broad set of developers who still largely rely on copilot-like systems, our work highlights key challenges of adopting more agentic systems into developer workflows.</p></details> |  |

In fact, in many cases, the tools can indeed determine what is engineerable. In fusion and fission1 energy engineering, software has become the dominant tool for design. For that reason, in 2024, for the first time ever, we asked 103 computational scientists developing the codes used in fusion and fission energy about the problems they are attempting to solve with their codes, the tools available to them to solve them, and their end to end developer experience with said tools. The results revealed a changing tide in software tools in fusion and fission, with more and more computational scientists preferring modern programming languages, open-source codes, and modular software. These trends represent a peek into what will happen 5 to 10 years in the future of nuclear engineering. Since the majority of our respondents belonged to US national labs and universities, these results hint at the most cutting-edge trends in the industry. The insights included in the State of Computational Science in Fission and Fusion Energy indicate a dramatic shift toward multiphysics codes, a drop-off in the use of FORTRAN in favor of more modern languages like Python and C++, and ever-rising budgets for code development, at times reaching $50M in a single organization. Our survey paints a future of nuclear engineering codes that is modular in nature, small in terms of compute, and increasingly prioritized by organizations. Access to our results in web form are available online.</p></details> |  |

However, this practice is fraught with risks related to software licensing. A lack of understanding may lead to disputes, which can pose serious legal and operational challenges. To these ends, both academia and industry have conducted various investigations and proposed solutions and tools to deal with these challenges. However, significant limitations still remain. Moreover, the rapid evolution of open-source software (OSS) licenses, as well as the rapidly incorporated generative software engineering techniques, such as large language models for code (CodeLLMs), are placing greater demands on the systematic management of software license risks. To unveil the severe challenges and explore possible future directions, we conduct the first systematic literature review (SLR) on 80 carefully selected OSS license-related papers, classifying existing research into three key categories, i.e., license identification, license risk assessment, and license risk mitigation. Based on these, we discuss challenges in existing solutions, conclude the opportunities to shed light on future research directions and offer practical recommendations for practitioners. We hope this thorough review will help bridge the gaps between academia and industry and accelerate the ecosystem-wide governance of legitimate software risks within the software engineering community.</p></details> |  |

However, model creation usually relies on laborious manual transformation of the unstructured point cloud data provided by laser scans or photogrammetry. This paper presents Cloud2BIM, an open-source software tool designed to automate the conversion of point clouds into BIM models compliant with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. Cloud2BIM integrates advanced algorithms for wall and slab segmentation, opening detection, and room zoning based on real wall surfaces, resulting in a comprehensive and fully automated workflow. Unlike existing tools, it avoids computationally- and calibration-intensive techniques such as RANSAC, supports non-orthogonal geometries, and provides unprecedented processing speed-achieving results up to seven times faster than fastest competing solutions. Systematic validation using benchmark datasets confirms that Cloud2BIM is an easy-to-use, efficient, and scalable solution for generating accurate BIM models, capable of converting extensive point cloud datasets for entire buildings into IFC format with minimal user input.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published version, 23 pages, 25 figures</p></details> |

Smaller space organisations and new entrants often struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured documents such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory standards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate requirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven approach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into semantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content from domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language models (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the space domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in collaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort, improve coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance alignment. We outline a roadmap toward broader integration of AI in RE workflows, intending to lower barriers for smaller organisations to participate in large-scale, safety-critical missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Engineering for Requirements Engineering: A Literature Review and Roadmap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07682v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of prompt engineering (PE) techniques that can enhance various requirements engineering (RE) tasks. However, current LLMs are often characterized by significant uncertainty and a lack of controllability. This absence of clear guidance on how to effectively prompt LLMs acts as a barrier to their trustworthy implementation in the RE field. We present the first roadmap-oriented systematic literature review of Prompt Engineering for RE (PE4RE). Following Kitchenham's and Petersen's secondary-study protocol, we searched six digital libraries, screened 867 records, and analyzed 35 primary studies. To bring order to a fragmented landscape, we propose a hybrid taxonomy that links technique-oriented patterns (e.g., few-shot, Chain-of-Thought) to task-oriented RE roles (elicitation, validation, traceability). Two research questions, with five sub-questions, map the tasks addressed, LLM families used, and prompt types adopted, and expose current limitations and research gaps. Finally, we outline a step-by-step roadmap showing how today's ad-hoc PE prototypes can evolve into reproducible, practitioner-friendly workflows.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Quantum Executor, a backend-agnostic execution engine designed to orchestrate quantum experiments across heterogeneous platforms. Quantum Executor provides a declarative and modular interface that decouples experiment design from backend execution, enabling seamless interoperability and code reuse across diverse quantum and classical resources. Key features include support for asynchronous and distributed execution, customizable execution strategies and a unified API for managing quantum experiments. We illustrate its applicability through two life-like usage scenarios such as automated benchmarking and hybrid validation, discussing its capacity to streamline quantum development. We conclude by discussing current limitations and outlining a roadmap for future enhancements.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

The feasibility of this vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to automating requirements-centric SE tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering (RE) conference</p></details> |

To realize this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited availability of quantum computer hardware, high computational demands of simulating quantum computers on classical systems, and complicated technology stack to enable currently available accelerators into development environments. These limitations make it difficult for the developer to create an efficient workflow for quantum software development. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote hardware and offering speedup in execution with simulator surroundings. The goal is to allow the development of more complex circuits and to support an iterative software development approach. In our experiment, with the solution presented in this paper, we have obtained up to 5 times faster circuit execution runtime, and enabled qubit ranges from 21 to 29 qubits with a simple plug-and-play kernel for the Jupyter notebook.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.06756</p></details> |

However, given the expensive measurements, large configuration space, and rugged configuration landscape, existing tuners suffer ineffectiveness due to the difficult balance of budget utilization between exploring uncertain regions (for escaping from local optima) and exploiting guidance of known good configurations (for fast convergence). The root cause is that we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes challenges in the explainability of the results. In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by causally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn rules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify them with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated reflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these places in the landscape. This, as we demonstrate, can effectively mitigate the impact of the exploration and exploitation trade-off. Those purified regions can then be paired with the measured configurations to provide spatial explainability at the landscape level. Comparing with 11 state-of-the-art tuners on 12 systems and varying budgets, we show that PromiseTune performs significantly better than the others with 42% superior rank to the overall second best while providing richer information to explain the hidden system characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICSE26</p></details> |

However, TEE applications are still confronted with vulnerabilities stemming from bad partitioning. Bad partitioning can lead to critical security problems of TEE, such as leaking sensitive data to the normal world or being adversely affected by malicious inputs from the normal world. To address this, we propose an approach to detect partitioning issues in TEE applications. First, we conducted a survey of TEE vulnerabilities caused by bad partitioning and found that the parameters exchanged between the secure and normal worlds often contain insecure usage with bad partitioning implementation. Second, we developed a tool named DITING that can analyze data-flows of these parameters and identify their violations of security rules we defined to find bad partitioning issues. Different from existing research that only focuses on malicious input to TEE, we assess the partitioning issues more comprehensively through input/output and shared memory. Finally, we created the first benchmark targeting bad partitioning, consisting of 110 test cases. Experiments demonstrate that DITING achieves an F1 score of 0.90 in identifying bad partitioning issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Generation of Explainability Requirements and Software Explanations From User Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07344v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability has become a crucial non-functional requirement to enhance transparency, build user trust, and ensure regulatory compliance. However, translating explanation needs expressed in user feedback into structured requirements and corresponding explanations remains challenging. While existing methods can identify explanation-related concerns in user reviews, there is no established approach for systematically deriving requirements and generating aligned explanations. To contribute toward addressing this gap, we introduce a tool-supported approach that automates this process. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collaborated with an industrial automation manufacturer to create a dataset of 58 user reviews, each annotated with manually crafted explainability requirements and explanations. Our evaluation shows that while AI-generated requirements often lack relevance and correctness compared to human-created ones, the AI-generated explanations are frequently preferred for their clarity and style. Nonetheless, correctness remains an issue, highlighting the importance of human validation. This work contributes to the advancement of explainability requirements in software systems by (1) introducing an automated approach to derive requirements from user reviews and generate corresponding explanations, (2) providing empirical insights into the strengths and limitations of automatically generated artifacts, and (3) releasing a curated dataset to support future research on the automatic generation of explainability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Workshop (REW 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing sentiment analysis tools often perform inconsistently across datasets from different platforms, due to variations in communication style and content. In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14 sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new datasets, using their characteristic features as input. Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and statistical properties. While transformer-based models such as SetFit and RoBERTa consistently achieve strong results, tool effectiveness remains context-dependent.

Existing sentiment analysis tools in software engineering primarily rely on English or non-German gold-standard datasets. To address this gap, our work introduces a German dataset of 5,949 unique developer statements, extracted from the German developer forum Android-Hilfe.de. Each statement was annotated with one of six basic emotions, based on the emotion model by Shaver et al., by four German-speaking computer science students. Evaluation of the annotation process showed high interrater agreement and reliability. These results indicate that the dataset is sufficiently valid and robust to support sentiment analysis in the German-speaking software engineering community. Evaluation with existing German sentiment analysis tools confirms the lack of domain-specific solutions for software engineering. We also discuss approaches to optimize annotation and present further use cases for the dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Workshop (REW 2025)</p></details> |

Existing approaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task, omitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete and explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLord outperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.</p></details> |  |

However, measuring this attribute poses challenges in both industry and academia. While static analysis tools assess attributes such as code smells and comment percentage, code reviews introduce an element of subjectivity. This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate code quality attributes related to its readability in a standardized, reproducible, and consistent manner. We conducted a quasi-experiment study to measure the effects of code changes on Large Language Model (LLM)s interpretation regarding its readability quality attribute. Nine LLMs were tested, undergoing three interventions: removing comments, replacing identifier names with obscure names, and refactoring to remove code smells. Each intervention involved 10 batch analyses per LLM, collecting data on response variability. We compared the results with a known reference model and tool. The results showed that all LLMs were sensitive to the interventions, with agreement with the reference classifier being high for the original and refactored code scenarios. The LLMs demonstrated a strong semantic sensitivity that the reference model did not fully capture. A thematic analysis of the LLMs reasoning confirmed their evaluations directly reflected the nature of each intervention. The models also exhibited response variability, with 9.37% to 14.58% of executions showing a standard deviation greater than zero, indicating response oscillation, though this did not always compromise the statistical significance of the results. LLMs demonstrated potential for evaluating semantic quality aspects, such as coherence between identifier names, comments, and documentation with code purpose.</p></details> |  |
| **[HLSTester: Efficient Testing of Behavioral Discrepancies with LLMs for High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14641v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In high-level synthesis (HLS), C/C++ programs with synthesis directives are used to generate circuits for FPGA implementations. However, hardware-specific and platform-dependent characteristics in these implementations can introduce behavioral discrepancies between the original C/C++ programs and the circuits after high-level synthesis. Existing methods for testing behavioral discrepancies in HLS are still immature, and the testing workflow requires significant human efforts. To address this challenge, we propose HLSTester, a large language model (LLM) aided testing framework that efficiently detects behavioral discrepancies in HLS. To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs and enhance prompt quality, the testbenches for original C/C++ programs are leveraged to guide LLMs in generating HLS-compatible testbenches, effectively eliminating certain traditional C/C++ constructs that are incompatible with HLS tools. Key variables are pinpointed through a backward slicing technique in both C/C++ and HLS programs to monitor their runtime spectra, enabling an in-depth analysis of the discrepancy symptoms. To reduce test time, a testing input generation mechanism is introduced to integrate dynamic mutation with insights from an LLM-based progressive reasoning chain. In addition, repetitive hardware testing is skipped by a redundancy-aware filtering technique for the generated test inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-aided testing framework significantly accelerates the testing workflow while achieving higher testbench simulation pass rates compared with the traditional method and the direct use of LLMs on the same HLS programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.03889</p></details> |

A Comparison of Interviews, Focus Groups, and Surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23684v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software systems grow increasingly complex, explainability has become a crucial non-functional requirement for transparency, user trust, and regulatory compliance. Eliciting explainability requirements is challenging, as different methods capture varying levels of detail and structure. This study examines the efficiency and effectiveness of three commonly used elicitation methods - focus groups, interviews, and online surveys - while also assessing the role of taxonomy usage in structuring and improving the elicitation process. We conducted a case study at a large German IT consulting company, utilizing a web-based personnel management software. A total of two focus groups, 18 interviews, and an online survey with 188 participants were analyzed. The results show that interviews were the most efficient, capturing the highest number of distinct needs per participant per time spent. Surveys collected the most explanation needs overall but had high redundancy. Delayed taxonomy introduction resulted in a greater number and diversity of needs, suggesting that a two-phase approach is beneficial. Based on our findings, we recommend a hybrid approach combining surveys and interviews to balance efficiency and coverage. Future research should explore how automation can support elicitation and how taxonomies can be better integrated into different methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the research track of the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE 2025)</p></details> |

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in mission-critical applications, there emerges a pressing need for frameworks that are not only explicit and systematic but also minimal enough to remain practical and broadly accessible. While many existing approaches address prompt structuring through elaborate Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) or multi-layered templates, such methods can impose significant token and cognitive overhead, potentially constraining the model's creative capacity. In this context, we propose the 5C Prompt Contract, a framework that distills prompt design into five intuitive components: Character, Cause, Constraint, Contingency, and Calibration. This minimal cognitive schema explicitly integrates fallback and output optimization directives, fostering reliable, interpretable, and creatively flexible AI interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that the 5C framework consistently achieves superior input token efficiency while maintaining rich and consistent outputs across diverse LLM architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and Gemini), making it particularly suited for individuals and Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with limited AI engineering resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 tables.

To address these challenges, a diverse range of machine learning fairness interventions have been developed, aiming to mitigate bias and promote the creation of more equitable models. Despite the growing availability of these interventions, their adoption in real-world applications remains limited, with many practitioners unaware of their existence. To address this gap, we systematically identified and compiled a dataset of 62 open source fairness interventions and identified active ones. We conducted an in-depth analysis of their specifications and features to uncover considerations that may drive practitioner preference and to identify the software interventions actively maintained in the open source ecosystem.

However, recent work has demonstrated that functional activity in white matter also plays a meaningful role in both cognition and learning. In previous work, we introduced the High Angular Resolution Functional Imaging (HARFI) pipeline, which demonstrated both local and global patterns of functional correlation in white matter. Notably, HARFI enabled exploration of asymmetric voxel-wise correlation using odd-order spherical harmonics. Although the original implementation of HARFI was released via GitHub, adoption was limited due to the technical complexity of running the source code. In this work, we present a robust and efficient containerized version of the HARFI pipeline, enabling seamless execution across multiple public datasets. Our goal is to facilitate broader and deeper exploration of functional white matter architecture, especially through the lens of high angular resolution functional correlations. The key innovation of this work is the containerized implementation, which we have made available under a permissive open-source license to support reproducible and accessible research practices.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from best practices in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), we argue that reproducibility, scalability, and collaboration in quantum research can benefit significantly from structured tracking workflows. This paper explores the application of MLflow in quantum research, illustrating how it enables better development practices, experiment reproducibility, decision making, and cross-domain integration in an increasingly hybrid classical-quantum landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are They All Good? Evaluating the Quality of CoTs in LLM-based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06980v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation, particularly when augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps, which act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human programmers. Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the generated code. However, little is known about the quality of CoT generated by LLMs. To what extent can we trust the thoughts generated by LLMs? How good are they? This paper empirically explores the external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by analyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation benchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by analyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting LLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such as unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while internal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs' misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even when CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to instruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with flawed CoTs. (3) Refining low-quality CoTs is feasible, i.e., LLMs improve when given detailed problem descriptions. These findings highlight key challenges in CoT-based code generation and suggest directions for improving LLM reasoning and reliability.</p></details> |  |

Traffic sign recognition, an essential component of autonomous vehicles, is particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise driving safety. In this paper, we propose an N-version machine learning (NVML) framework that integrates a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism. Our approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs. We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages including appendix, 1 figure</p></details> |

The AADL standard, SAE International AS5506D, describes Run-Time Services (RTS) to be provided to execute AADL models in accordance with semantics defined by the standard. The RTS of primary concern are transport services and timing services. Although, the study presented in [1] sets a foundation for the formal semantics of AADL, but without modeling time. This paper extends and simplifies this formalization using a modal logic defined by a Kripke structure, to explicitly include time. The RTS defined in the AADL standard are also expanded to support reactive state-transition machines of the Behavior Specification annex standard language (BA) and its closely-related, formally-defined counterpart, the Behavior Language for Embedded Systems with Software (BLESS). An example of AADL RTS with time, implemented by the High Assurance Modeling and Rapid Engineering for Embedded Systems (HAMR) for state-transition machine behavior written in BLESS, is also presented.</p></details> | 35 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Semantic Conflict Detection via Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06762v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic conflicts arise when a developer introduces changes to a codebase that unintentionally affect the behavior of changes integrated in parallel by other developers. Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts, so complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed. SMAT relies on generating and executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a developer's modified version, but fails again after merging with another developer's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated. While SMAT is effective at detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly due to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and Evosuite. To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome these limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on Code Llama 70B into SMAT. We explore the model's ability to generate tests using different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter configurations. Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler systems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex, real-world systems. We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in detecting conflicts. Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation remains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there is promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection. -- Conflitos sem^anticos surgem quando um desenvolvedor introduz mudan\c{c}as em uma base de c\'odigo que afetam, de forma n~ao intencional, o comportamento de altera\c{c}~oes integradas em paralelo por outros desenvolvedores.

So far LLMgCode has more quality issues than human-authored code (HaCode). It is common for LLMgCode to mix with HaCode in a code change, while the change is signed by only human developers, without being carefully examined. Many automated methods have been proposed to detect LLMgCode from HaCode, in which the perplexity-based method (PERPLEXITY for short) is the state-of-the-art method. However, the efficacy evaluation of PERPLEXITY has focused on detection accuracy. Yet it is unclear whether PERPLEXITY is good enough in a wider range of realistic evaluation settings. To this end, we carry out a family of experiments to compare PERPLEXITY against feature- and pre-training-based methods from three perspectives: detection accuracy, detection speed, and generalization capability. The experimental results show that PERPLEXITY has the best generalization capability while having limited detection accuracy and detection speed. Based on that, we discuss the strengths and limitations of PERPLEXITY, e.g., PERPLEXITY is unsuitable for high-level programming languages. Finally, we provide recommendations to improve PERPLEXITY and apply it in practice. As the first large-scale investigation on detecting LLMgCode from HaCode, this article provides a wide range of findings for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |
| **[Issue Tracking Ecosystems: Context and Best Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06704v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue Tracking Systems (ITSs), such as GitHub and Jira, are popular tools that support Software Engineering (SE) organisations through the management of ``issues'', which represent different SE artefacts such as requirements, development tasks, and maintenance items. ITSs also support internal linking between issues, and external linking to other tools and information sources. This provides SE organisations key forms of documentation, including forwards and backwards traceability (e.g., Feature Requests linked to sprint releases and code commits linked to Bug Reports). An Issue Tracking Ecosystem (ITE) is the aggregate of the central ITS and the related SE artefacts, stakeholders, and processes -- with an emphasis on how these contextual factors interact with the ITS. The quality of ITEs is central to the success of these organisations and their software products. There are challenges, however, within ITEs, including complex networks of interlinked artefacts and diverse workflows. While ITSs have been the subject of study in SE research for decades, ITEs as a whole need further exploration. In this thesis, I undertake the challenge of understanding ITEs at a broader level, addressing these questions regarding complexity and diversity. I interviewed practitioners and performed archival analysis on a diverse set of ITSs. These analyses revealed the context-dependent nature of ITE problems, highlighting the need for context-specific ITE research. While previous work has produced many solutions to specific ITS problems, these solutions are not consistently framed in a context-rich and comparable way, leading to a desire for more aligned solutions across research and practice. To address this emergent information and lack of alignment, I created the Best Practice Ontology for ITEs. <... truncated due to arXiv abstract character limit ...></p></details> | <details><summary>300 p...</summary><p>300 pages, Dissertation for the doctoral degree Dr. rer. nat. at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Natural Sciences, Department of Informatics, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Small Language Models for Code Generation: An Empirical Study with Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03160v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements of Small Language Models (SLMs) have opened new possibilities for efficient code generation. SLMs offer lightweight and cost-effective alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), making them attractive for use in resource-constrained environments. However, empirical understanding of SLMs, particularly their capabilities, limitations, and performance trade-offs in code generation remains limited. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 20 open-source SLMs ranging from 0.4B to 10B parameters on five diverse code-related benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, Mercury, HumanEvalPack, and CodeXGLUE). The models are assessed along three dimensions: i) functional correctness of generated code, ii) computational efficiency and iii) performance across multiple programming languages. The findings of this study reveal that several compact SLMs achieve competitive results while maintaining a balance between performance and efficiency, making them viable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, achieving further improvements in accuracy requires switching to larger models. These models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, but they require much more computational power. We observe that for 10% performance improvements, models can require nearly a 4x increase in VRAM consumption, highlighting a trade-off between effectiveness and scalability. Besides, the multilingual performance analysis reveals that SLMs tend to perform better in languages such as Python, Java, and PHP, while exhibiting relatively weaker performance in Go, C++, and Ruby. However, statistical analysis suggests these differences are not significant, indicating a generalizability of SLMs across programming languages. Based on the findings, this work provides insights into the design and selection of SLMs for real-world code generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 Tables, 57 figures.

| **[Finding Compiler Bugs through Cross-Language Code Generator and Differential Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06584v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compilers play a central role in translating high-level code into executable programs, making their correctness essential for ensuring code safety and reliability. While extensive research has focused on verifying the correctness of compilers for single-language compilation, the correctness of cross-language compilation - which involves the interaction between two languages and their respective compilers - remains largely unexplored. To fill this research gap, we propose CrossLangFuzzer, a novel framework that introduces a universal intermediate representation (IR) for JVM-based languages and automatically generates cross-language test programs with diverse type parameters and complex inheritance structures. After generating the initial IR, CrossLangFuzzer applies three mutation techniques - LangShuffler, FunctionRemoval, and TypeChanger - to enhance program diversity. By evaluating both the original and mutated programs across multiple compiler versions, CrossLangFuzzer successfully uncovered 10 confirmed bugs in the Kotlin compiler, 4 confirmed bugs in the Groovy compiler, 7 confirmed bugs in the Scala 3 compiler, 2 confirmed bugs in the Scala 2 compiler, and 1 confirmed bug in the Java compiler. Among all mutators, TypeChanger is the most effective, detecting 11 of the 24 compiler bugs. Furthermore, we analyze the symptoms and root causes of cross-compilation bugs, examining the respective responsibilities of language compilers when incorrect behavior occurs during cross-language compilation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork specifically focused on identifying and diagnosing compiler bugs in cross-language compilation scenarios. Our research helps to understand these challenges and contributes to improving compiler correctness in multi-language environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 40th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA)</p></details> |

To effectively address and mitigate these security and compliance challenges, security risk management strategies are essential. However, it must adhere to well-established strategies and industry standards to ensure consistency, reliability, and compatibility both within and across organizations. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid risk assessment framework called TELSAFE, which employs probabilistic modeling for quantitative risk assessment and eliminates the influence of expert opinion bias. The framework encompasses both qualitative and quantitative assessment phases, facilitating effective risk management strategies tailored to the unique requirements of organizations. A specific use case utilizing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)-related data demonstrates the framework's applicability and implementation in real-world scenarios, such as in the telecommunications industry.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

We present the first systematic study of LLMs' ability to generate efficient C implementations of graph-analysis routines--code that must satisfy the stringent runtime and memory constraints. Eight state-of-the-art models (OpenAI ChatGPT o3 and o4-mini-high, Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet and Sonnet Extended, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro, xAI Grok 3-Think, and DeepSeek DeepThink R1) are benchmarked by two distinct approaches. The first approach checks the ability of LLMs in generating an algorithm outperforming other present algorithms in the benchmark. The second approach evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate graph algorithms for integration into the benchmark. Results show that Claude Sonnet 4 Extended achieves the best result in the case of ready-to-use code generation and efficiency, outperforming human-written baselines in triangle counting. The study confirms that contemporary LLMs excel at optimizing and integrating established algorithms but not inventing novel techniques. We provide prompts, the first approach's generated code, and measurement scripts to foster reproducible research.</p></details> |  |

While traditional profilers effectively identify execution bottlenecks by tracing system-level metrics, they fall short when it comes to application-level resource contention caused by waiting for application-level events. In this work, we introduce OmniResource Profiling, a performance analysis approach that integrates system-level and application-level resource tracing to diagnose resource bottlenecks comprehensively. gigiProfiler, our realization of OmniResource Profiling, uses a hybrid LLM-static analysis approach to identify application-defined resources offline and analyze their impact on performance during buggy executions to uncover the performance bottleneck. gigiProfiler then samples and records critical variables related to these bottleneck resources during buggy execution and compares their value with those from normal executions to identify the root causes. We evaluated gigiProfiler on 12 real-world performance issues across five applications. gigiProfiler accurately identified performance bottlenecks in all cases. gigiProfiler also successfully diagnosed the root causes of two newly emerged, previously undiagnosed problems, with the findings confirmed by developers.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e., they generate text which sounds plausible but is incorrect. Although there has been a recent surge in research on LLM hallucinations for text generation, similar hallucination phenomenon can happen in code generation. Sometimes the generated code can have syntactical or logical errors as well as more advanced issues like security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, etc. Given the wide adaptation of LLMs to enhance efficiency in code generation and development in general, it becomes imperative to investigate hallucinations in code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at studying hallucinations in the code generated by LLMs. We start by introducing the code hallucination definition and a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucination types. We propose the first benchmark CodeMirage dataset for code hallucinations. The benchmark contains 1,137 GPT-3.5 generated hallucinated code snippets for Python programming problems from two base datasets - HumanEval and MBPP. We then propose the methodology for code hallucination detection and experiment with open source LLMs such as CodeLLaMA as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models using one-shot prompt. We find that GPT-4 performs the best on HumanEval dataset and gives comparable results to the fine-tuned CodeBERT baseline on MBPP dataset. Towards the end, we discuss various mitigation strategies for code hallucinations and conclude our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AutoMates @ IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning</p></details> |

The Eager Test smell, one of the most prevalent, is often identified using simplified detection rules that practitioners find inadequate. Objective: We aim to improve the rules for detecting the Eager Test smell. Method: We reviewed the literature on test smells to analyze the definitions and detection rules of the Eager Test smell. We proposed a novel, unambiguous definition of the test smell and a heuristic to address the limitations of the existing rules. We evaluated our heuristic against existing detection rules by manually applying it to 300 unit test cases in Java. Results: Our review identified 56 relevant studies. We found that inadequate interpretations of original definitions of the Eager Test smell led to imprecise detection rules, resulting in a high level of disagreement in detection outcomes. Also, our heuristic detected patterns of eager and non-eager tests that existing rules missed. Conclusion: Our heuristic captures the essence of the Eager Test smell more precisely; hence, it may address practitioners' concerns regarding the adequacy of existing detection rules.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Architecture for Privacy-Preserving Telemetry Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06350v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a privacy-preserving telemetry aggregation scheme. Our underlying frequency estimation routine works within the framework of differential privacy. The design philosophy follows a client-server architecture. Furthermore, the system uses a local differential privacy scheme where data gets randomized on the client before submitting the request to the resource server. This scheme allows for data analysis on de-identified data by carefully adding noise to prevent re-identification attacks, thereby facilitating public data release without compromising the identifiability of the individual record. This work further enhances privacy guarantees by leveraging Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) to achieve increased privacy protection for data in transit that addresses pre-existing privacy vulnerabilities in raw HTTP. We provide an implementation that focuses on frequency estimation with a histogram of a known dictionary. Our resulting formulation based on OHTTP has provided stricter privacy safeguards when compared to trusting an organization to manually delete identifying information from the client's request in the ingestor as deployed in reference work~\cite{apple2017}.

While research has identified several quality attributes of test cases and test suites, there is a need for a better understanding of their relative importance in practice. Objective: We investigate practitioners' perceptions regarding the relative importance of quality attributes of test cases and test suites and the challenges they face in ensuring the perceived important quality attributes. Method: We conducted an industrial survey using a questionnaire based on the quality attributes identified in an extensive literature review. We used a sampling strategy that leverages LinkedIn to draw a large and heterogeneous sample of professionals with experience in software testing. Results: We collected 354 responses from practitioners with a wide range of experience. We found that the majority of practitioners rated Fault Detection, Usability, Maintainability, Reliability, and Coverage to be the most important quality attributes. Resource Efficiency, Reusability, and Simplicity received the most divergent opinions, which, according to our analysis, depend on the software-testing contexts. We identified common challenges that apply to the important attributes, namely inadequate definition, lack of useful metrics, lack of an established review process, and lack of external support. Conclusion: The findings point out where practitioners actually need further support with respect to achieving high-quality test cases and test suites under different software testing contexts. The findings can serve as a guideline for academic researchers when looking for research directions on the topic. The findings can also be used to encourage companies to provide more support to practitioners to achieve high-quality test cases and test suites.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR2: Attention-Guided Repair for the Robustness of CNNs Against Common Corruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06332v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2 operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world environments with diverse corruptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of Generative AI on Collaborative Open-Source Software Development: Evidence from GitHub Copilot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02091v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) enables automated content production, including coding in software development, which can significantly influence developer participation and performance. To explore its impact on collaborative open-source software (OSS) development, we investigate the role of GitHub Copilot, a generative AI pair programmer, in OSS development where multiple distributed developers voluntarily collaborate. Using GitHub's proprietary Copilot usage data, combined with public OSS repository data obtained from GitHub, we find that Copilot use increases project-level code contributions by 5.9%. This gain is driven by a 2.1% increase in individual code contributions and a 3.4% rise in developer coding participation. However, these benefits come at a cost as coordination time for code integration increases by 8% due to more code discussions enabled by AI pair programmers. This reveals an important tradeoff: While AI expands who can contribute and how much they contribute, it slows coordination in collective development efforts. Despite this tension, the combined effect of these two competing forces remains positive, indicating a net gain in overall project-level productivity from using AI pair programmers. Interestingly, we also find the effects differ across developer roles. Peripheral developers show relatively smaller gains in project-level code contributions and face a higher increase in coordination time than core developers, likely due to the difference in their project familiarity. In summary, our study underscores the dual role of AI pair programmers in affecting project-level code contributions and coordination time in OSS development. Our findings on the differential effects between core and peripheral developers also provide important implications for the structure of OSS communities in the long run.</p></details> |  |

| **[RPHunter: Unveiling Rug Pull Schemes in Crypto Token via Code-and-Transaction Fusion Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18398v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rug pull scams have emerged as a persistent threat to cryptocurrency, causing significant financial losses. A typical scenario involves scammers deploying honeypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and draining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens. Current methods either rely on predefined patterns to detect code risks or utilize statistical transaction data to train detection models. However, real-world Rug Pull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and suspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one aspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively. In this paper, we propose RPHunter, a novel technique that integrates code and transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPHunter establishes declarative rules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further constructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage transaction information, RPHunter formulates dynamic token transaction activities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are characterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives. Finally, RPHunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary features from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model to enhance the detection of Rug Pull. We manually analyzed 645 Rug Pull incidents from code and transaction aspects and constructed a ground-truth dataset. We evaluated RPHunter on our dataset, achieving a precision of 95.3%, a recall of 93.8% and an F1 score of 94.5%, which highlights superior performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, when applied to the real-world scenarios, RPHunter has identified 4801 Rug Pull tokens, achieving a precision of 90.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContractTrace: Retracing Smart Contract Versions for Security Analyses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20866v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the inherent immutability of blockchain technology, smart contract updates require their deployment at new addresses rather than modifying existing ones, thus fragmenting version histories and creating critical blind spots for analyses. Indeed, for example, this fragmentation severely hinders security researchers ability to track vulnerability lifecycles across contract versions. While platforms like Etherscan provide detailed information about Ethereum smart contracts, they lack crucial functionality to trace predecessor-successor relationships within smart contract lineages, preventing systematic analysis of how vulnerabilities emerge, propagate, and potentially remain unresolved across versions.To address the challenge of tracing smart contract lineages, we adopt a Design Science Research (DSR) approach and introduce ContractTrace, an automated infrastructure that accurately identifies and links versions of smart contracts into coherent lineages. This tool enables the construction of lineageSet, an up-to-date, open-source dataset specifically designed to support security research on vulnerability, defect or any other property evolution patterns in smart contracts. Through a security-focused case study we demonstrate how ContractTrace reveals previously obscured vulnerability life-cycles within smart contract lineages, tracking whether critical security flaws persist or get resolved across versions. This capability is essential for understanding vulnerability propagation patterns and evaluating the effectiveness of security patches in blockchain environments. In the evaluation phase of our DSR approach, we validated our lineage detection methodology against an alternative approach using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to cluster contract versions, confirming the security relevance and accuracy of our technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Those users are often developers themselves looking for relevant documentation to ensure that their AI systems comply with the ethical requirements of existing laws, guidelines, and standards. Recent studies indicate inadequate model documentation practices, suggesting a gap between AI requirements and current practices in model documentation. To understand this gap and provide actionable guidance to bridge it, we conducted a thematic analysis of 26 guidelines on ethics and AI, three AI documentation frameworks, three quantitative studies of model cards, and ten actual model cards. We identified a total of 43 ethical requirements relevant to model documentation and organized them into a taxonomy featuring four themes and twelve sub-themes representing ethical principles. Our findings indicate that model developers predominantly emphasize model capabilities and reliability in the documentation while overlooking other ethical aspects, such as explainability, user autonomy, and fairness. This underscores the need for enhanced support in documenting ethical AI considerations. Our taxonomy serves as a foundation for a revised model card framework that holistically addresses ethical AI requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025 conference</p></details> |

Research on improving their accuracy mainly focuses on prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation. However, these methods often treat models as isolated black boxes - relying on single-pass outputs without iterative refinement or collaboration, limiting robustness and adaptability. Objective: We propose that, just as human debates enhance accuracy and reduce bias in RE tasks by incorporating diverse perspectives, different LLM agents debating and collaborating may achieve similar improvements. Our goal is to investigate whether Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) strategies can enhance RE performance. Method: We conducted a systematic study of existing MAD strategies across various domains to identify their key characteristics. To assess their applicability in RE, we implemented and tested a preliminary MAD-based framework for RE classification. Results: Our study identified and categorized several MAD strategies, leading to a taxonomy outlining their core attributes. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of applying MAD to RE classification. Conclusions: MAD presents a promising approach for improving LLM accuracy in RE tasks. This study provides a foundational understanding of MAD strategies, offering insights for future research and refinements in RE applications.</p></details> |  |

There is an urgent need to ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect diverse data under different driving environments. To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments, camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images, and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.</p></details> |  |

These issues, exacerbated by token limits, often cause models to miss vulnerability-related signals, thereby impairing effective learning. A key intuition is to enhance LMs with concise, information-rich context. Commit-based annotations offer precise, CWE-agnostic supervision, but are unavailable during inference, as they depend on historical code changes. Moreover, their extreme sparsity, often covering only a few lines, makes it difficult for LMs to process directly. In this paper, we propose FocusVul, a model-agnostic framework that improves LM-based vulnerability detection by learning to select sensitive context. FocusVul learns commit-based annotation patterns through hierarchical semantic modeling and generalizes them to identify line-level vulnerability-relevant regions during inference. It then extracts LM-oriented context via both dependency and execution flows surrounding selected regions, yielding semantically rich inputs for effective vulnerability detection. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that FocusVul consistently outperforms heuristic-based and full-function fine-tuning approaches, improving classification performance by 164.04% and reducing FLOPs by 19.12% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>withd...</summary><p>withdrawal for fixing errors</p></details> |

However, limitations of LLMs such as irrelevant or incorrect code have highlighted the need for prompt programming (or prompt engineering) where engineers apply specific prompt techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought or input-output examples) to improve the generated code. While some prompt techniques have been studied, the impact of different techniques -- and their interactions -- on code generation is still not fully understood. In this study, we introduce CodePromptEval, a dataset of 7072 prompts designed to evaluate five prompt techniques (few-shot, persona, chain-of-thought, function signature, list of packages) and their effect on the correctness, similarity, and quality of complete functions generated by three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3, and Mistral). Our findings show that while certain prompt techniques significantly influence the generated code, combining multiple techniques does not necessarily improve the outcome. Additionally, we observed a trade-off between correctness and quality when using prompt techniques. Our dataset and replication package enable future research on improving LLM-generated code and evaluating new prompt techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE).

Current security analysis methodologies in vulnerability detection can be categorized into static analysis and dynamic analysis methods.However, these existing traditional vulnerability detection methods predominantly rely on analyzing original contract code, not all smart contracts provide accessible code.We present ETrace, a novel event-driven vulnerability detection framework for smart contracts, which uniquely identifies potential vulnerabilities through LLM-powered trace analysis without requiring source code access. By extracting fine-grained event sequences from transaction logs, the framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive semantic interpreters to reconstruct event analysis through chain-of-thought reasoning. ETrace implements pattern-matching to establish causal links between transaction behavior patterns and known attack behaviors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of ETrace through preliminary experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure.

Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247 training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and 5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns, and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7% recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems, competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets, and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible research in RL safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Detection of Intermittent Job Failures Using Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04173v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such as bugs. Prior studies developed machine learning (ML) models trained on large datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1 open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32% of intermittent job failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based approach achieves 70-88% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects, outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52% F1-score) in 4 projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution - ICSME 2025 (Industry Track); 12 pages; typos corrected</p></details> |

However, the underlying large language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study, we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned, emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search-based Selection of Metamorphic Relations for Optimized Robustness Testing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05565v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally, most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides insights into search-based solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool for Supporting Debugging and Understanding of Normative Requirements Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05504v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Exception Safety Code Generation with Intermediate Representation Agents Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06949v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with robust exception handling in generated code, leading to fragile programs that are prone to runtime errors. We propose Seeker, a novel multi-agent framework that enforces exception safety in LLM generated code through an Intermediate Representation (IR) approach. Seeker decomposes exception handling into five specialized agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler that collaboratively analyze code, detect fragile segments, retrieve best practice exception strategies, and inject robust handling code. We also introduce Common Exception Enumeration (CEE), a comprehensive knowledge base derived from official documentation, technical practices, and real world code, to standardize exception handling strategies. Seeker also incorporates a Deep Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Deep RAG) algorithm to efficiently navigate the exception inheritance hierarchy, cutting down search overhead by 93% while improving accuracy in identifying relevant exceptions. We evaluate Seeker on 15 open source Java projects and multiple benchmarks. Seeker outperforms state of the art baselines, improving exception handling precision by up to 37% and overall code robustness by 38% as measured by expert code review. It significantly closes the gap between LLM and human developers in exception management, achieving a 28% success rate on real world issue fixes (SWE bench) versus 19% by prior methods. Our framework preserves functional correctness of code while proactively handling errors, demonstrating a practical, generalizable solution for safer code generation. In this paper, we discuss the novelty of using intermediate representation and multi-agent collaboration for exception handling, and outline how Seeker can be extended to other programming languages and complex software engineering tasks, aligning LLM-generated code with industrial standard.</p></details> |  |

This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |

While numerous studies have examined developer use of copilots, which can provide chat assistance or code completions, evaluations of coding agents, which can automatically write files and run code, still largely rely on static benchmarks without humans-in-the-loop. In this work, we conduct the first academic study to explore developer interactions with coding agents and characterize how more autonomous AI tools affect user productivity and experience, compared to existing copilots. We evaluate two leading copilot and agentic coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and OpenHands, recruiting participants who regularly use the former. Our results show agents have the potential to assist developers in ways that surpass copilots (e.g., completing tasks that humans might not have accomplished before) and reduce the user effort required to complete tasks. However, there are challenges involved in enabling their broader adoption, including how to ensure users have an adequate understanding of agent behaviors. Our results not only provide insights into how developer workflows change as a result of coding agents but also highlight how user interactions with agents differ from those with existing copilots, motivating a set of recommendations for researchers building new agents. Given the broad set of developers who still largely rely on copilot-like systems, our work highlights key challenges of adopting more agentic systems into developer workflows.</p></details> |  |

Smaller space organisations and new entrants often struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured documents such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory standards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate requirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven approach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into semantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content from domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language models (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the space domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in collaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort, improve coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance alignment. We outline a roadmap toward broader integration of AI in RE workflows, intending to lower barriers for smaller organisations to participate in large-scale, safety-critical missions.</p></details> |  |

| **[From Requirements to Code: Understanding Developer Practices in LLM-Assisted Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07548v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of generative LLMs and their advanced code generation capabilities, some people already envision the end of traditional software engineering, as LLMs may be able to produce high-quality code based solely on the requirements a domain expert feeds into the system. The feasibility of this vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to automating requirements-centric SE tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering (RE) conference</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recent approaches such as CUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural sequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these methods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating, resulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update scenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging large language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in software engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and program repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic behind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment updating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on each update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel comment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies to provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a ranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy, 10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in SentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated by LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance of incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting.

One avenue to improve translation accuracy is through intermediate representations, which could provide structured insights to guide the model's understanding. We explore whether code translation using LLMs can benefit from intermediate representations via natural language (NL) and abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open Gpt4 8X7B and specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful translations for the best-performing model (Open Gpt4 8X7B) compared to the zero-shot prompt.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Classifying App Users' Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08250v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, significant research has been conducted into classifying application (app) user feedback, primarily relying on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, fine-tuning more generalizable classifiers based on existing labeled datasets remains an important challenge, as creating large and accurately labeled datasets often requires considerable time and resources. In this paper, we evaluate the capabilities of four advanced LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70b, to enhance user feedback classification and address the challenge of the limited labeled dataset. To achieve this, we conduct several experiments on eight datasets that have been meticulously labeled in prior research. These datasets include user reviews from app stores, posts from the X platform, and discussions from the public forums, widely recognized as representative sources of app user feedback. We analyze the performance of various LLMs in identifying both fine-grained and coarse-grained user feedback categories. Given the substantial volume of daily user feedback and the computational limitations of LLMs, we leverage these models as an annotation tool to augment labeled datasets with general and app-specific data. This augmentation aims to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art BERT-based classification models. Our findings indicate that LLMs when guided by well-crafted prompts, can effectively classify user feedback into coarse-grained categories. Moreover, augmenting the training dataset with datasets labeled using the consensus of LLMs can significantly enhance classifier performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the current implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN (to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future standardization efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[From Domain Documents to Requirements: Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the Space Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07689v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements engineering (RE) in the space industry is inherently complex, demanding high precision, alignment with rigorous standards, and adaptability to mission-specific constraints. Smaller space organisations and new entrants often struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured documents such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory standards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate requirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven approach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into semantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content from domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language models (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the space domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in collaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort, improve coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance alignment. We outline a roadmap toward broader integration of AI in RE workflows, intending to lower barriers for smaller organisations to participate in large-scale, safety-critical missions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dually Hierarchical Drift Adaptation for Online Configuration Performance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08730v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |

However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance, and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages; 2 figures; Preprint with the original submission accepted for publication at 39th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)</p></details> |

| **[Computing Floating-Point Errors by Injecting Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08467v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Floating-point programs form the foundation of modern science and engineering, providing the essential computational framework for a wide range of applications, such as safety-critical systems, aerospace engineering, and financial analysis. Floating-point errors can lead to severe consequences. Although floating-point errors widely exist, only a subset of inputs may trigger significant errors in floating-point programs. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend to take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for detecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1) difficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time. The two recent tools, ATOMU and FPCC, can partially address these issues. However, ATOMU suffers from false positives; while FPCC, though eliminating false positives, operates at a considerably slower speed. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel approach named PI-detector to computing floating-point errors effectively and efficiently. Our approach is based on the observation that floating-point errors stem from large condition numbers in atomic operations (such as addition and subtraction), which then propagate and accumulate. PI-detector injects small perturbations into the operands of individual atomic operations within the program and compares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to compute floating-point errors. We evaluate PI-detector with datasets from ATOMU and HSED, as well as a complex linear system-solving program. Experimental results demonstrate that PI-detector can perform efficient and accurate floating-point error computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.20804</p></details> |
| **[ProvideQ: A Quantum Optimization Toolbox](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07649v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid solvers for combinatorial optimization problems combine the advantages of classical and quantum computing to overcome difficult computational challenges. Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to make their performance competitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted and accepted at the IEEE QSW 2025.

| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Classifying App Users' Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08250v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, significant research has been conducted into classifying application (app) user feedback, primarily relying on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, fine-tuning more generalizable classifiers based on existing labeled datasets remains an important challenge, as creating large and accurately labeled datasets often requires considerable time and resources. In this paper, we evaluate the capabilities of four advanced LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70b, to enhance user feedback classification and address the challenge of the limited labeled dataset. To achieve this, we conduct several experiments on eight datasets that have been meticulously labeled in prior research. These datasets include user reviews from app stores, posts from the X platform, and discussions from the public forums, widely recognized as representative sources of app user feedback. We analyze the performance of various LLMs in identifying both fine-grained and coarse-grained user feedback categories. Given the substantial volume of daily user feedback and the computational limitations of LLMs, we leverage these models as an annotation tool to augment labeled datasets with general and app-specific data. This augmentation aims to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art BERT-based classification models. Our findings indicate that LLMs when guided by well-crafted prompts, can effectively classify user feedback into coarse-grained categories. Moreover, augmenting the training dataset with datasets labeled using the consensus of LLMs can significantly enhance classifier performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the current implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN (to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future standardization efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

However, they also raise concerns, particularly the risk that developers may rely heavily on these tools, reducing their understanding of the generated code. We hypothesize that this loss of understanding may be reflected in source code knowledge models, which are used to identify developer expertise. In this work, we present an exploratory analysis of how a knowledge model and a Truck Factor algorithm built upon it can be affected by GenAI usage. To investigate this, we collected statistical data on the integration of ChatGPT-generated code into GitHub projects and simulated various scenarios by adjusting the degree of GenAI contribution. Our findings reveal that most scenarios led to measurable impacts, indicating the sensitivity of current expertise metrics. This suggests that as GenAI becomes more integrated into development workflows, the reliability of such metrics may decrease.</p></details> |  |

How Increasing AI Automation Transforms Developer Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08149v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers now have access to a growing array of increasingly autonomous AI tools to support software development. While numerous studies have examined developer use of copilots, which can provide chat assistance or code completions, evaluations of coding agents, which can automatically write files and run code, still largely rely on static benchmarks without humans-in-the-loop. In this work, we conduct the first academic study to explore developer interactions with coding agents and characterize how more autonomous AI tools affect user productivity and experience, compared to existing copilots. We evaluate two leading copilot and agentic coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and OpenHands, recruiting participants who regularly use the former. Our results show agents have the potential to assist developers in ways that surpass copilots (e.g., completing tasks that humans might not have accomplished before) and reduce the user effort required to complete tasks. However, there are challenges involved in enabling their broader adoption, including how to ensure users have an adequate understanding of agent behaviors. Our results not only provide insights into how developer workflows change as a result of coding agents but also highlight how user interactions with agents differ from those with existing copilots, motivating a set of recommendations for researchers building new agents. Given the broad set of developers who still largely rely on copilot-like systems, our work highlights key challenges of adopting more agentic systems into developer workflows.</p></details> |  |

In fact, in many cases, the tools can indeed determine what is engineerable. In fusion and fission1 energy engineering, software has become the dominant tool for design. For that reason, in 2024, for the first time ever, we asked 103 computational scientists developing the codes used in fusion and fission energy about the problems they are attempting to solve with their codes, the tools available to them to solve them, and their end to end developer experience with said tools. The results revealed a changing tide in software tools in fusion and fission, with more and more computational scientists preferring modern programming languages, open-source codes, and modular software. These trends represent a peek into what will happen 5 to 10 years in the future of nuclear engineering. Since the majority of our respondents belonged to US national labs and universities, these results hint at the most cutting-edge trends in the industry. The insights included in the State of Computational Science in Fission and Fusion Energy indicate a dramatic shift toward multiphysics codes, a drop-off in the use of FORTRAN in favor of more modern languages like Python and C++, and ever-rising budgets for code development, at times reaching $50M in a single organization. Our survey paints a future of nuclear engineering codes that is modular in nature, small in terms of compute, and increasingly prioritized by organizations.

However, this practice is fraught with risks related to software licensing. A lack of understanding may lead to disputes, which can pose serious legal and operational challenges. To these ends, both academia and industry have conducted various investigations and proposed solutions and tools to deal with these challenges. However, significant limitations still remain. Moreover, the rapid evolution of open-source software (OSS) licenses, as well as the rapidly incorporated generative software engineering techniques, such as large language models for code (CodeLLMs), are placing greater demands on the systematic management of software license risks. To unveil the severe challenges and explore possible future directions, we conduct the first systematic literature review (SLR) on 80 carefully selected OSS license-related papers, classifying existing research into three key categories, i.e., license identification, license risk assessment, and license risk mitigation. Based on these, we discuss challenges in existing solutions, conclude the opportunities to shed light on future research directions and offer practical recommendations for practitioners. We hope this thorough review will help bridge the gaps between academia and industry and accelerate the ecosystem-wide governance of legitimate software risks within the software engineering community.</p></details> |  |

However, model creation usually relies on laborious manual transformation of the unstructured point cloud data provided by laser scans or photogrammetry. This paper presents Cloud2BIM, an open-source software tool designed to automate the conversion of point clouds into BIM models compliant with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. Cloud2BIM integrates advanced algorithms for wall and slab segmentation, opening detection, and room zoning based on real wall surfaces, resulting in a comprehensive and fully automated workflow. Unlike existing tools, it avoids computationally- and calibration-intensive techniques such as RANSAC, supports non-orthogonal geometries, and provides unprecedented processing speed-achieving results up to seven times faster than fastest competing solutions. Systematic validation using benchmark datasets confirms that Cloud2BIM is an easy-to-use, efficient, and scalable solution for generating accurate BIM models, capable of converting extensive point cloud datasets for entire buildings into IFC format with minimal user input.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published version, 23 pages, 25 figures</p></details> |

Smaller space organisations and new entrants often struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured documents such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory standards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate requirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven approach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into semantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content from domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language models (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the space domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in collaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort, improve coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance alignment. We outline a roadmap toward broader integration of AI in RE workflows, intending to lower barriers for smaller organisations to participate in large-scale, safety-critical missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Engineering for Requirements Engineering: A Literature Review and Roadmap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07682v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of prompt engineering (PE) techniques that can enhance various requirements engineering (RE) tasks. However, current LLMs are often characterized by significant uncertainty and a lack of controllability. This absence of clear guidance on how to effectively prompt LLMs acts as a barrier to their trustworthy implementation in the RE field. We present the first roadmap-oriented systematic literature review of Prompt Engineering for RE (PE4RE). Following Kitchenham's and Petersen's secondary-study protocol, we searched six digital libraries, screened 867 records, and analyzed 35 primary studies. To bring order to a fragmented landscape, we propose a hybrid taxonomy that links technique-oriented patterns (e.g., few-shot, Chain-of-Thought) to task-oriented RE roles (elicitation, validation, traceability). Two research questions, with five sub-questions, map the tasks addressed, LLM families used, and prompt types adopted, and expose current limitations and research gaps. Finally, we outline a step-by-step roadmap showing how today's ad-hoc PE prototypes can evolve into reproducible, practitioner-friendly workflows.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Quantum Executor, a backend-agnostic execution engine designed to orchestrate quantum experiments across heterogeneous platforms. Quantum Executor provides a declarative and modular interface that decouples experiment design from backend execution, enabling seamless interoperability and code reuse across diverse quantum and classical resources. Key features include support for asynchronous and distributed execution, customizable execution strategies and a unified API for managing quantum experiments. We illustrate its applicability through two life-like usage scenarios such as automated benchmarking and hybrid validation, discussing its capacity to streamline quantum development. We conclude by discussing current limitations and outlining a roadmap for future enhancements.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

The feasibility of this vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to automating requirements-centric SE tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering (RE) conference</p></details> |

To realize this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited availability of quantum computer hardware, high computational demands of simulating quantum computers on classical systems, and complicated technology stack to enable currently available accelerators into development environments. These limitations make it difficult for the developer to create an efficient workflow for quantum software development. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote hardware and offering speedup in execution with simulator surroundings. The goal is to allow the development of more complex circuits and to support an iterative software development approach. In our experiment, with the solution presented in this paper, we have obtained up to 5 times faster circuit execution runtime, and enabled qubit ranges from 21 to 29 qubits with a simple plug-and-play kernel for the Jupyter notebook.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.06756</p></details> |

However, given the expensive measurements, large configuration space, and rugged configuration landscape, existing tuners suffer ineffectiveness due to the difficult balance of budget utilization between exploring uncertain regions (for escaping from local optima) and exploiting guidance of known good configurations (for fast convergence). The root cause is that we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes challenges in the explainability of the results. In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by causally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn rules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify them with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated reflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these places in the landscape. This, as we demonstrate, can effectively mitigate the impact of the exploration and exploitation trade-off. Those purified regions can then be paired with the measured configurations to provide spatial explainability at the landscape level. Comparing with 11 state-of-the-art tuners on 12 systems and varying budgets, we show that PromiseTune performs significantly better than the others with 42% superior rank to the overall second best while providing richer information to explain the hidden system characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICSE26</p></details> |

However, TEE applications are still confronted with vulnerabilities stemming from bad partitioning. Bad partitioning can lead to critical security problems of TEE, such as leaking sensitive data to the normal world or being adversely affected by malicious inputs from the normal world. To address this, we propose an approach to detect partitioning issues in TEE applications. First, we conducted a survey of TEE vulnerabilities caused by bad partitioning and found that the parameters exchanged between the secure and normal worlds often contain insecure usage with bad partitioning implementation. Second, we developed a tool named DITING that can analyze data-flows of these parameters and identify their violations of security rules we defined to find bad partitioning issues. Different from existing research that only focuses on malicious input to TEE, we assess the partitioning issues more comprehensively through input/output and shared memory. Finally, we created the first benchmark targeting bad partitioning, consisting of 110 test cases. Experiments demonstrate that DITING achieves an F1 score of 0.90 in identifying bad partitioning issues.</p></details> |  |

However, translating explanation needs expressed in user feedback into structured requirements and corresponding explanations remains challenging. While existing methods can identify explanation-related concerns in user reviews, there is no established approach for systematically deriving requirements and generating aligned explanations. To contribute toward addressing this gap, we introduce a tool-supported approach that automates this process. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collaborated with an industrial automation manufacturer to create a dataset of 58 user reviews, each annotated with manually crafted explainability requirements and explanations. Our evaluation shows that while AI-generated requirements often lack relevance and correctness compared to human-created ones, the AI-generated explanations are frequently preferred for their clarity and style. Nonetheless, correctness remains an issue, highlighting the importance of human validation. This work contributes to the advancement of explainability requirements in software systems by (1) introducing an automated approach to derive requirements from user reviews and generate corresponding explanations, (2) providing empirical insights into the strengths and limitations of automatically generated artifacts, and (3) releasing a curated dataset to support future research on the automatic generation of explainability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Workshop (REW 2025)</p></details> |

In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14 sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new datasets, using their characteristic features as input. Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and statistical properties.

Each statement was annotated with one of six basic emotions, based on the emotion model by Shaver et al., by four German-speaking computer science students. Evaluation of the annotation process showed high interrater agreement and reliability. These results indicate that the dataset is sufficiently valid and robust to support sentiment analysis in the German-speaking software engineering community.

Existing approaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task, omitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete and explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLord outperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recent approaches such as CUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural sequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these methods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating, resulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update scenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging large language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in software engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and program repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic behind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment updating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on each update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel comment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies to provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a ranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy, 10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in SentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated by LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance of incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input. Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting.

One avenue to improve translation accuracy is through intermediate representations, which could provide structured insights to guide the model's understanding. We explore whether code translation using LLMs can benefit from intermediate representations via natural language (NL) and abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open Gpt4 8X7B and specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful translations for the best-performing model (Open Gpt4 8X7B) compared to the zero-shot prompt.</p></details> |  |

Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to make their performance competitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted and accepted at the IEEE QSW 2025.

| **[The Impact of Generative AI on Code Expertise Models: An Exploratory Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08160v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools for source code generation have significantly boosted productivity in software development. However, they also raise concerns, particularly the risk that developers may rely heavily on these tools, reducing their understanding of the generated code. We hypothesize that this loss of understanding may be reflected in source code knowledge models, which are used to identify developer expertise. In this work, we present an exploratory analysis of how a knowledge model and a Truck Factor algorithm built upon it can be affected by GenAI usage. To investigate this, we collected statistical data on the integration of ChatGPT-generated code into GitHub projects and simulated various scenarios by adjusting the degree of GenAI contribution. Our findings reveal that most scenarios led to measurable impacts, indicating the sensitivity of current expertise metrics. This suggests that as GenAI becomes more integrated into development workflows, the reliability of such metrics may decrease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code with Me or for Me? How Increasing AI Automation Transforms Developer Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08149v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers now have access to a growing array of increasingly autonomous AI tools to support software development. While numerous studies have examined developer use of copilots, which can provide chat assistance or code completions, evaluations of coding agents, which can automatically write files and run code, still largely rely on static benchmarks without humans-in-the-loop. In this work, we conduct the first academic study to explore developer interactions with coding agents and characterize how more autonomous AI tools affect user productivity and experience, compared to existing copilots. We evaluate two leading copilot and agentic coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and OpenHands, recruiting participants who regularly use the former. Our results show agents have the potential to assist developers in ways that surpass copilots (e.g., completing tasks that humans might not have accomplished before) and reduce the user effort required to complete tasks. However, there are challenges involved in enabling their broader adoption, including how to ensure users have an adequate understanding of agent behaviors. Our results not only provide insights into how developer workflows change as a result of coding agents but also highlight how user interactions with agents differ from those with existing copilots, motivating a set of recommendations for researchers building new agents. Given the broad set of developers who still largely rely on copilot-like systems, our work highlights key challenges of adopting more agentic systems into developer workflows.</p></details> |  |

In fact, in many cases, the tools can indeed determine what is engineerable. In fusion and fission1 energy engineering, software has become the dominant tool for design. For that reason, in 2024, for the first time ever, we asked 103 computational scientists developing the codes used in fusion and fission energy about the problems they are attempting to solve with their codes, the tools available to them to solve them, and their end to end developer experience with said tools. The results revealed a changing tide in software tools in fusion and fission, with more and more computational scientists preferring modern programming languages, open-source codes, and modular software. These trends represent a peek into what will happen 5 to 10 years in the future of nuclear engineering. Since the majority of our respondents belonged to US national labs and universities, these results hint at the most cutting-edge trends in the industry. The insights included in the State of Computational Science in Fission and Fusion Energy indicate a dramatic shift toward multiphysics codes, a drop-off in the use of FORTRAN in favor of more modern languages like Python and C++, and ever-rising budgets for code development, at times reaching $50M in a single organization. Our survey paints a future of nuclear engineering codes that is modular in nature, small in terms of compute, and increasingly prioritized by organizations. Access to our results in web form are available online.</p></details> |  |

However, this practice is fraught with risks related to software licensing. A lack of understanding may lead to disputes, which can pose serious legal and operational challenges. To these ends, both academia and industry have conducted various investigations and proposed solutions and tools to deal with these challenges. However, significant limitations still remain. Moreover, the rapid evolution of open-source software (OSS) licenses, as well as the rapidly incorporated generative software engineering techniques, such as large language models for code (CodeLLMs), are placing greater demands on the systematic management of software license risks. To unveil the severe challenges and explore possible future directions, we conduct the first systematic literature review (SLR) on 80 carefully selected OSS license-related papers, classifying existing research into three key categories, i.e., license identification, license risk assessment, and license risk mitigation. Based on these, we discuss challenges in existing solutions, conclude the opportunities to shed light on future research directions and offer practical recommendations for practitioners. We hope this thorough review will help bridge the gaps between academia and industry and accelerate the ecosystem-wide governance of legitimate software risks within the software engineering community.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Quantum Executor, a backend-agnostic execution engine designed to orchestrate quantum experiments across heterogeneous platforms. Quantum Executor provides a declarative and modular interface that decouples experiment design from backend execution, enabling seamless interoperability and code reuse across diverse quantum and classical resources. Key features include support for asynchronous and distributed execution, customizable execution strategies and a unified API for managing quantum experiments. We illustrate its applicability through two life-like usage scenarios such as automated benchmarking and hybrid validation, discussing its capacity to streamline quantum development. We conclude by discussing current limitations and outlining a roadmap for future enhancements.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

The feasibility of this vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to automating requirements-centric SE tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering (RE) conference</p></details> |

| **[Dually Hierarchical Drift Adaptation for Online Configuration Performance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08730v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |

MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks.

| **[Generating Proto-Personas through Prompt Engineering: A Case Study on Efficiency, Effectiveness and Empathy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08594v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment. However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance, and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages; 2 figures; Preprint with the original submission accepted for publication at 39th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)</p></details> |
