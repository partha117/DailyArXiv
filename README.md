| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly 3.9$\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\times$ other baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.</p></details> |  |

Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeRAG: Finding Relevant and Necessary Knowledge for Retrieval-Augmented Repository-Level Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16112v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code completion automatically predicts the unfinished code based on the broader information from the repository. Recent strides in Code Large Language Models (code LLMs) have spurred the development of repository-level code completion methods, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, they suffer from issues such as inappropriate query construction, single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code LLM. To address these problems, we introduce CodeRAG, a framework tailored to identify relevant and necessary knowledge for retrieval-augmented repository-level code completion. Its core components include log probability guided query construction, multi-path code retrieval, and preference-aligned BestFit reranking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks ReccEval and CCEval demonstrate that CodeRAG significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of CodeRAG is available at https://github.com/KDEGroup/CodeRAG.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

| **[When Bugs Linger: A Study of Anomalous Resolution Time Outliers and Their Themes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16140v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient bug resolution is critical for maintaining software quality and user satisfaction. However, specific bug reports experience unusually long resolution times, which may indicate underlying process inefficiencies or complex issues. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of bug resolution anomalies across seven prominent open-source repositories: Cassandra, Firefox, Hadoop, HBase, SeaMonkey, Spark, and Thunderbird. Utilizing statistical methods such as Z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR), we identify anomalies in bug resolution durations. To understand the thematic nature of these anomalies, we apply Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for textual feature extraction and KMeans clustering to group similar bug summaries. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across projects, with anomalies often clustering around test failures, enhancement requests, and user interface issues. This approach provides actionable insights for project maintainers to prioritize and effectively address long-standing bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 tables, 21 figures</p></details> |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous systems, giving rise to a new class of software known as Agentware, where LLM-powered agents perform complex, open-ended tasks in domains such as software engineering, customer service, and data analysis. However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeakageDetector 2.0: Analyzing Data Leakage in Jupyter-Driven Machine Learning Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15971v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In software development environments, code quality is crucial. This study aims to assist Machine Learning (ML) engineers in enhancing their code by identifying and correcting Data Leakage issues within their models. Data Leakage occurs when information from the test dataset is inadvertently included in the training data when preparing a data science model, resulting in misleading performance evaluations. ML developers must carefully separate their data into training, evaluation, and test sets to avoid introducing Data Leakage into their code. In this paper, we develop a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension, called LeakageDetector, that detects Data Leakage, mainly Overlap, Preprocessing and Multi-test leakage, from Jupyter Notebook files. Beyond detection, we included two correction mechanisms: a conventional approach, known as a quick fix, which manually fixes the leakage, and an LLM-driven approach that guides ML developers toward best practices for building ML pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundational Design Principles and Patterns for Building Robust and Adaptive GenAI-Native Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15411v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains. However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems. We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this conceptual framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThermalGuardian: Temperature-Aware Testing of Automotive Deep Learning Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15815v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems, supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Are We? An Empirical Analysis of Current Vulnerability Localization Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15777v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source software vulnerability patch detection is a critical component for maintaining software security and ensuring software supply chain integrity. Traditional manual detection methods face significant scalability challenges when processing large volumes of commit histories, while being prone to human errors and omissions. Existing automated approaches, including heuristic-based methods and pre-trained model solutions, suffer from limited accuracy, poor generalization capabilities, and inherent methodological constraints that hinder their practical deployment. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study of existing vulnerability patch detection methods, revealing four key insights that guide the design of effective solutions: the critical impact of search space reduction, the superiority of pre-trained semantic understanding over architectural complexity, the temporal limitations of web crawling approaches, and the advantages of knowledge-driven methods. Based on these insights, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines version-driven candidate filtering with large language model-based multi-round dialogue voting to achieve accurate and efficient vulnerability patch identification. Extensive experiments on a dataset containing 750 real vulnerabilities demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |

| **[RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |
| **[From Legacy Fortran to Portable Kokkos: An Autonomous Agentic AI Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12443v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of Programmers' Trust in Generative AI Programming Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13253v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation. Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Good Vibrations? A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rethinking Technology Stack Selection with AI Coding Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11132v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now an integral part of software development workflows and are reshaping the whole process. Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[ViScratch: Using Large Language Models and Gameplay Videos for Automated Feedback in Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11065v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based programming environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in programming education, in particular for young learners. While the use of blocks helps prevent syntax errors, semantic bugs remain common and difficult to debug. Existing tools for Scratch debugging rely heavily on predefined rules or user manual inputs, and crucially, they ignore the platform's inherently visual nature. We introduce ViScratch, the first multimodal feedback generation system for Scratch that leverages both the project's block code and its generated gameplay video to diagnose and repair bugs. ViScratch uses a two-stage pipeline: a vision-language model first aligns visual symptoms with code structure to identify a single critical issue, then proposes minimal, abstract syntax tree level repairs that are verified via execution in the Scratch virtual machine. We evaluate ViScratch on a set of real-world Scratch projects against state-of-the-art LLM-based tools and human testers. Results show that gameplay video is a crucial debugging signal: ViScratch substantially outperforms prior tools in both bug identification and repair quality, even without access to project descriptions or goals. This work demonstrates that video can serve as a first-class specification in visual programming environments, opening new directions for LLM-based debugging beyond symbolic code alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Testing and Adapting REST APIs as LLM Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15546v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build autonomous agents that perform complex tasks with external tools, often exposed through APIs in enterprise systems. Direct use of these APIs is difficult due to the complex input schema and verbose responses. Current benchmarks overlook these challenges, leaving a gap in assessing API readiness for agent-driven automation. We present a testing framework that systematically evaluates enterprise APIs when wrapped as Python tools for LLM-based agents. The framework generates data-aware test cases, translates them into natural language instructions, and evaluates whether agents can correctly invoke the tool, handle their inputs, and process its responses. We apply the framework to generate over 2400 test cases across different domains and develop a taxonomy of common errors, including input misinterpretation, output failures, and schema mismatches. We further classify errors to support debugging and tool refinement. Our framework provides a systematic approach to enabling enterprise APIs as reliable tools for agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality, leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging, and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches. Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code, coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators. Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers seeking to balance security with software quality in web application development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Challenging Bug Prediction and Repair Models with Synthetic Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02407v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs are essential in software engineering; many research studies in the past decades have been proposed to detect, localize, and repair bugs in software systems. Effectiveness evaluation of such techniques requires complex bugs, i.e., those that are hard to detect through testing and hard to repair through debugging. From the classic software engineering point of view, a hard-to-repair bug differs from the correct code in multiple locations, making it hard to localize and repair. Hard-to-detect bugs, on the other hand, manifest themselves under specific test inputs and reachability conditions. These two objectives, i.e., generating hard-to-detect and hard-to-repair bugs, are mostly aligned; a bug generation technique can change multiple statements to be covered only under a specific set of inputs. However, these two objectives are conflicting for learning-based techniques: A bug should have a similar code representation to the correct code in the training data to challenge a bug prediction model to distinguish them. The hard-to-repair bug definition remains the same but with a caveat: the more a bug differs from the original code, the more distant their representations are and easier to be detected. We propose BugFarm, to transform arbitrary code into multiple complex bugs. BugFarm leverages LLMs to mutate code in multiple locations (hard-to-repair). To ensure that multiple modifications do not notably change the code representation, BugFarm analyzes the attention of the underlying model and instructs LLMs to only change the least attended locations (hard-to-detect). Our comprehensive evaluation of 435k+ bugs from over 1.9M mutants generated by BUGFARM and two alternative approaches demonstrates our superiority in generating bugs that are hard to detect by learning-based bug prediction approaches and hard-to-repair by state-of-the-art learning-based program repair technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in SCAM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and repairing faults when programs fail to formally verify can be complex and time-consuming. Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIO: Multiverse Debugging in the Face of Input/Output -- Extended Version with Additional Appendices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06845v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution paths within the state space. Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e. states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse, may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is caused by the debugger. This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during regular execution. We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our techniques. As a demonstration of the approach we highlight a color dial built with a Lego Mindstorms motor, and color sensor, providing a tangible example of how our approach enables multiverse debugging for programs running on an STM32 microcontroller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This extended version provides auxiliary material to the article of the same title that will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the PACMPL issue for OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging. While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22 subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs, where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well in repository-level debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures, EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

This fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP, a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop "Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool integration. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/MCP-Github-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[CFaults: Model-Based Diagnosis for Fault Localization in C Programs with Multiple Test Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09337v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks in software development. Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |

Their adoption requires systematic investigation to ensure responsible integration into curricula. Objective: This doctoral research aims to develop a validated framework for integrating LLMs into SE education through a multi-phase process, including taxonomies development, empirical investigation, and case studies. This paper presents the first empirical step. Method: We conducted a pilot repository mining study of 400 GitHub projects, analyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of motivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8] study. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits), software engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming assistance and debugging support (97 hits) were strongly represented. Demotivators, including plagiarism and IP concerns (385 hits), security, privacy and data integrity (87 hits), and over-reliance on AI in learning (39 hits), also appeared prominently. In contrast, demotivators such as challenges in evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded no hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical validation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes, highlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a comprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE education.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Developers' Self-Declaration of AI-Generated Code: An Analysis of Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16485v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers, who use them to assist in software development due to their capability to generate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 15 images, 8 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the dynamic data dependency of a step that reads a variable $v$ is challenging. It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |

However, the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong, which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that - unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic quantum debugging strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access, Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Repair of C Programs Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01947v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the repair of C programs. We present a framework that integrates spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT. This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |

The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has examined the quality of AI-generated code, little is known about how developers actually use these suggestions in real-world collaboration. We analyze 338 pull requests from 255 GitHub repositories containing self-admitted ChatGPT usage, including 645 AI-generated snippets and 3,486 developer-authored patches. We introduce PatchTrack, a tool that classifies whether ChatGPT patches were applied, not applied, or not suggested, enabling fine-grained analysis of AI-assisted decisions. Full adoption of ChatGPT code is rare: the median integration rate was 25%. A qualitative analysis of 89 pull requests with integrated patches revealed recurring patterns of structural integration, selective extraction, and iterative refinement, showing that developers typically treat ChatGPT's output as a starting point rather than a final implementation. Even when code was not directly adopted, ChatGPT influenced workflows through conceptual guidance, documentation, and debugging strategies. Integration decisions were shaped by scope, architectural fit, contributor role, and review norms. This study offers empirical insight into how generative AI is used in collaborative software development, showing that its impact extends beyond patch generation to broader decision-making. Our findings inform the design of AI-assisted tools, clarify patch adoption behavior, and support more transparent and effective use of LLMs in practice.</p></details> | 53 pages, 8 figures |

Therefore, effective and efficient debugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However, the teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in indirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer Science (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way. In this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging that interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance aims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper learning experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be integrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. We developed a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization techniques and large language models. Students can use features like the automated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and executed a small-scale, controlled experiment with eight undergraduate CS students. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the systematic guidance. They rated the automated setting of breakpoints as most effective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the breakpoint explanations. In future, we will extend our concept and implementation, and perform more intensive user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE-NIER 2025</p></details> |

Monitoring through logging a long-standing practice in traditional software offers a potential means for auditing ML applications, as logs provide traceable records of system behavior useful for debugging, performance analysis, and continuous auditing. systematically auditing models for compliance or accountability. The findings underscore the need for enhanced logging practices and tooling that systematically integrate responsible AI metrics. Such practices would support the development of auditable, transparent, and ethically responsible ML systems, aligning with growing regulatory requirements and societal expectations. By highlighting specific deficiencies and opportunities, this work provides actionable guidance for both practitioners and tool developers seeking to strengthen the accountability and trustworthiness of ML applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Did I Do Wrong? Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334v4)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[ARSP: Automated Repair of Verilog Designs via Semantic Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16517v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging functional Verilog bugs consumes a significant portion of front-end design time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

Existing agent-based methods often struggle to fully and accurately reproduce implementation details such as mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic. Previous studies show that reflection with explicit feedback improves agent performance. However, current paper reproduction methods fail to effectively adopt this strategy. This gap mainly arises from the diverse paper patterns, complex method modules, and varied configurations encountered in research papers. Motivated by how humans use systematic checklists to efficiently debug complex code, we propose \textbf{RePro}, a \textbf{Re}flective Paper-to-Code \textbf{Repro}duction framework that automatically extracts a paper's fingerprint, referring to a comprehensive set of accurate and atomic criteria serving as high-quality supervisory signals. The framework first generates code based on the extracted information, and then leverages the fingerprint within iterative verification and refinement loop. This approach systematically detects discrepancies and produces targeted revisions to align generated code with the paper's implementation details. Extensive experiments on the PaperBench Code-Dev benchmark have been conducted, RePro achieves 13.0\% performance gap over baselines, and it correctly revises complex logical and mathematical criteria in reflecting, on which the effectiveness is obvious.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-hoc LLM-Supported Debugging of Distributed Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14540v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems. Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations. These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes. Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely accessible to all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICWE 2025, Delft (30 June - 03 July 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defects4Log: Benchmarking LLMs for Logging Code Defect Detection and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11305v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniLLP: Enhancing LLM-based Log Level Prediction with Context-Aware Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08545v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8). Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy. Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally, our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and observability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07468v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceLens: Question-Driven Debugging for Taint Flow Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |

However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01215v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |

Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

This study benchmarks these four prominent LLMs on one hundred and fifty LeetCode problems across easy, medium, and hard difficulties, generating solutions in Java and Python. We evaluate each model based on execution time, memory usage, and algorithmic complexity, revealing significant performance differences. ChatGPT demonstrates consistent efficiency in execution time and memory usage, while Copilot and DeepSeek show variability as task complexity increases.

Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains.

An Empirical Study on the Testing Process of LLM-Powered Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00198v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Software systems powered by large language models are becoming a routine part of everyday technologies, supporting applications across a wide range of domains. In software engineering, many studies have focused on how LLMs support tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation. However, there has been limited focus on how full systems that integrate LLMs are tested during development. Aims: This study explores how LLM-powered systems are tested in the context of real-world application development. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 99 individual reports written by students who built and deployed LLM-powered applications as part of a university course. Each report was independently analyzed using thematic analysis, supported by a structured coding process. Results: Testing strategies combined manual and automated methods to evaluate both system logic and model behavior. Common practices included exploratory testing, unit testing, and prompt iteration. Reported challenges included integration failures, unpredictable outputs, prompt sensitivity, hallucinations, and uncertainty about correctness. Conclusions: Testing LLM-powered systems required adaptations to traditional verification methods, blending source-level reasoning with behavior-aware evaluations. These findings provide evidence on the practical context of testing generative components in software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Screencast-Based Analysis of User-Perceived GUI Responsiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01337v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUI responsiveness is critical for a positive user experience in mobile applications. Even brief delays in visual feedback can frustrate users and lead to negative reviews. However, detecting and quantifying such user-perceived delays remains challenging, especially in industrial testing pipelines that evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions. Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful, may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively. In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts -- video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Machine Learning Pipeline for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00045v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of software development practices has introduced challenges in ensuring quality and efficiency across the software engineering (SE) lifecycle. As SE systems grow in complexity, traditional approaches often fail to scale, resulting in longer debugging times, inefficient defect detection, and resource-heavy development cycles. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a key solution, enabling automation in tasks such as defect prediction, code review, and release quality estimation. However, the effectiveness of ML in SE depends on the robustness of its pipeline, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, validation, and evaluation. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines state-of-the-art ML pipelines designed for SE, consolidating best practices, challenges, and gaps. Our findings show that robust preprocessing, such as SMOTE for data balancing and SZZ-based algorithms for feature selection, improves model reliability. Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting dominate performance across tasks, while simpler models such as Naive Bayes remain valuable for efficiency and interpretability. Evaluation metrics including AUC, F1-score, and precision are most common, with new metrics like Best Arithmetic Mean (BAM) emerging in niche applications. Validation techniques such as bootstrapping are widely used to ensure model stability and generalizability. This SLR highlights the importance of well-designed ML pipelines for addressing SE challenges and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize software quality and efficiency. By identifying gaps and trends, this study sets a foundation for advancing ML adoption and fostering innovation in increasingly complex development environments.</p></details> |  |

However, ABPs may raise specific concerns including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs, characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM research challenges towards XABPs.</p></details> |  |

The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15 participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by 50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use commercial code LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under review</p></details> |

This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly 3.9$\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\times$ other baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.</p></details> |  |

Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |

A standalone formal specification would enable verification both across versions of the reference client and against new client implementations, strengthening decentralization by reducing the risk of consensus-splitting bugs. Yet such a specification has long been considered intractable given the complexity of Bitcoin's consensus logic. We demonstrate a compact, executable, declarative C++ specification of Bitcoin consensus rules that syncs mainnet to tip in a few hours on a single thread. We also introduce the Hornet Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to encode these rules unambiguously for execution, enabling formal reasoning, consensus code generation, and AI-driven adversarial testing. Our spec-driven client Hornet Node offers a modern and modular complement to the reference client. Its clear, idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns, supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to token selection during decoding, particularly at decision points where uncertainty strongly affects program correctness. Conventional strategies such as greedy decoding treat all tokens uniformly and fail to capture the uncertainty characteristics unique to code, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis and show that a large fraction of generation errors arises from token misranking at high-uncertainty positions, where the correct token is available but not prioritized. To address this, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework that employs a lookahead-based, uncertainty-aware pause-and-rerank mechanism. AdaDec automatically learns model-specific uncertainty thresholds and selectively invokes reranking when high uncertainty is detected, leveraging lookahead to refine token choice. Across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and DevEval benchmarks, AdaDec yields substantial improvements, achieving up to 20.9% absolute gains in Pass@1 accuracy compared with greedy decoding, while consistently outperforming prior adaptive decoding approaches such as AdapT. Furthermore, by applying reranking only when necessary, AdaDec reduces computational overhead and latency, enhancing efficiency alongside reliability. These findings underscore the value of uncertainty-guided decoding strategies in advancing the robustness and practicality of LLM-based code generation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |

Recent strides in Code Large Language Models (code LLMs) have spurred the development of repository-level code completion methods, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, they suffer from issues such as inappropriate query construction, single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code LLM. To address these problems, we introduce CodeRAG, a framework tailored to identify relevant and necessary knowledge for retrieval-augmented repository-level code completion. Its core components include log probability guided query construction, multi-path code retrieval, and preference-aligned BestFit reranking.

However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to assist Machine Learning (ML) engineers in enhancing their code by identifying and correcting Data Leakage issues within their models. Data Leakage occurs when information from the test dataset is inadvertently included in the training data when preparing a data science model, resulting in misleading performance evaluations. ML developers must carefully separate their data into training, evaluation, and test sets to avoid introducing Data Leakage into their code. In this paper, we develop a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension, called LeakageDetector, that detects Data Leakage, mainly Overlap, Preprocessing and Multi-test leakage, from Jupyter Notebook files. Beyond detection, we included two correction mechanisms: a conventional approach, known as a quick fix, which manually fixes the leakage, and an LLM-driven approach that guides ML developers toward best practices for building ML pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Omitted Variable Bias in Empirical Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17026v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omitted variable bias occurs when a statistical model leaves out variables that are relevant determinants of the effects under study. This results in the model attributing the missing variables' effect to some of the included variables -- hence over- or under-estimating the latter's true effect. Omitted variable bias presents a significant threat to the validity of empirical research, particularly in non-experimental studies such as those prevalent in empirical software engineering. This paper illustrates the impact of omitted variable bias on two case studies in the software engineering domain, and uses them to present methods to investigate the possible presence of omitted variable bias, to estimate its impact, and to mitigate its drawbacks. The analysis techniques we present are based on causal structural models of the variables of interest, which provide a practical, intuitive summary of the key relations among variables. This paper demonstrates a sequence of analysis steps that inform the design and execution of any empirical study in software engineering. An important observation is that it pays off to invest effort investigating omitted variable bias before actually executing an empirical study, because this effort can lead to a more solid study design, and to a significant reduction in its threats to validity.</p></details> |  |

Functional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a standard technique used within Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to identify software failures and assess their consequences. Simulation-driven approaches have recently been shown to be effective in supporting FMEA. However, industries need evidence of the effectiveness of these approaches to increase practical adoption. This industrial paper presents our experience with using FMEA to analyze the safety of a CPS from the e-Bike domain. We used Simulink Fault Analyzer, an industrial tool that supports engineers with FMEA. We identified 13 realistic faults, modeled them, and analyzed their effects. We sought expert feedback to analyze the appropriateness of our models and the effectiveness of the faults in detecting safety breaches. Our results reveal that for the faults we identified, our models were accurate or contained minor imprecision that we subsequently corrected. They also confirm that FMEA helps engineers improve their models. Specifically, the output provided by the simulation-driven support for 38.4% (5 out of 13) of the faults did not match the engineers' expectations, helping them discover unexpected effects of the faults. We present a thorough discussion of our results and ten lessons learned. Our findings are useful for software engineers who work as Simulink engineers, use the Simulink Fault Analyzer, or work as safety analysts.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems. We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this conceptual framework.</p></details> |  |

To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Analysis of Current Vulnerability Localization Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15777v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source software vulnerability patch detection is a critical component for maintaining software security and ensuring software supply chain integrity. Traditional manual detection methods face significant scalability challenges when processing large volumes of commit histories, while being prone to human errors and omissions. Existing automated approaches, including heuristic-based methods and pre-trained model solutions, suffer from limited accuracy, poor generalization capabilities, and inherent methodological constraints that hinder their practical deployment. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study of existing vulnerability patch detection methods, revealing four key insights that guide the design of effective solutions: the critical impact of search space reduction, the superiority of pre-trained semantic understanding over architectural complexity, the temporal limitations of web crawling approaches, and the advantages of knowledge-driven methods. Based on these insights, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines version-driven candidate filtering with large language model-based multi-round dialogue voting to achieve accurate and efficient vulnerability patch identification. Extensive experiments on a dataset containing 750 real vulnerabilities demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adversarial Robust Behavior Sequence Anomaly Detection Approach Based on Critical Behavior Unit Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15756v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential deep learning models (e.g., RNN and LSTM) can learn the sequence features of software behaviors, such as API or syscall sequences. However, recent studies have shown that these deep learning-based approaches are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Attackers can use adversarial samples to change the sequential characteristics of behavior sequences and mislead malware classifiers. In this paper, an adversarial robustness anomaly detection method based on the analysis of behavior units is proposed to overcome this problem. We extract related behaviors that usually perform a behavior intention as a behavior unit, which contains the representative semantic information of local behaviors and can be used to improve the robustness of behavior analysis. By learning the overall semantics of each behavior unit and the contextual relationships among behavior units based on a multilevel deep learning model, our approach can mitigate perturbation attacks that target local and large-scale behaviors. In addition, our approach can be applied to both low-level and high-level behavior logs (e.g., API and syscall logs). The experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the compared methods, which indicates that our approach has better performance against obfuscation attacks.</p></details> |  |

Its clear, idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns, supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to token selection during decoding, particularly at decision points where uncertainty strongly affects program correctness. Conventional strategies such as greedy decoding treat all tokens uniformly and fail to capture the uncertainty characteristics unique to code, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis and show that a large fraction of generation errors arises from token misranking at high-uncertainty positions, where the correct token is available but not prioritized. To address this, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework that employs a lookahead-based, uncertainty-aware pause-and-rerank mechanism. AdaDec automatically learns model-specific uncertainty thresholds and selectively invokes reranking when high uncertainty is detected, leveraging lookahead to refine token choice. Across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and DevEval benchmarks, AdaDec yields substantial improvements, achieving up to 20.9% absolute gains in Pass@1 accuracy compared with greedy decoding, while consistently outperforming prior adaptive decoding approaches such as AdapT. Furthermore, by applying reranking only when necessary, AdaDec reduces computational overhead and latency, enhancing efficiency alongside reliability. These findings underscore the value of uncertainty-guided decoding strategies in advancing the robustness and practicality of LLM-based code generation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |
| **[An MLIR-Based Compilation Framework for Control Flow Management on Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02167v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) present both high flexibility and efficiency, making them well-suited for the acceleration of intensive workloads. Nevertheless, a key barrier towards their widespread adoption is posed by CGRA compilation, which must cope with a multi-dimensional space spanning both the spatial and the temporal domains. Indeed, state-of-the-art compilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of applications, while having little or no support for control flow. Hence, they mostly target the mapping of single loops and/or delegate the management of control flow divergences to ad-hoc hardware units. Conversely, in this paper we show that control flow can be effectively managed and optimized at the compilation level, allowing for a broad set of applications to be targeted while being hardware-agnostic and achieving high performance. We embody our methodology in a modular compilation framework consisting of transformation and optimization passes, enabling support for applications with arbitrary control flows running on abstract CGRA meshes. We also introduce a novel mapping methodology that acts as a compilation back-end, addressing the limitations in available CGRA hardware resources and guaranteeing a feasible solution in the compilation process. Our framework achieves up to 2.1X speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, purely through compilation optimizations.</p></details> |  |

They effectively help developers understand code changes and better perform software maintenance tasks. Unfortunately, developers often neglect to write high-quality commit messages in practice. Therefore, a growing body of work is proposed to generate commit messages automatically. These works all demonstrated that how to organize and represent code changes is vital in generating good commit messages, including the use of fine-grained graphs or embeddings to better represent code changes. In this study, we choose an alternative way to condense code changes before generation, i.e., proposing brief yet concise text templates consisting of the following three parts: (1) summarized code changes, (2) elicited comments, and (3) emphasized code identifiers. Specifically, we first condense code changes by using our proposed templates with the help of a heuristic-based tool named ChangeScribe, and then fine-tune CodeLlama-7B on the pairs of our proposed templates and corresponding commit messages. Our proposed templates better utilize pre-trained language models, while being naturally brief and readable to complement generated commit messages for developers. Our evaluation based on a widely used dataset showed that our approach can outperform six baselines in terms of BLEU-Norm, METEOR, and ROUGE-L, with average improvements of 51.7%, 78.7%, and 62.5%, respectively. The ablation study and human evaluation also provide further insights into the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Maintaining and updating these patches across different kernel versions demands significant effort from experienced engineers. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across various domains, suggesting their potential for automating out-of-tree kernel patch migration. However, our findings reveal that LLMs, while promising, struggle with incomplete code context understanding and inaccurate migration point identification. In this work, we propose MigGPT, a framework that employs a novel code fingerprint structure to retain code snippet information and incorporates three meticulously designed modules to improve the migration accuracy and efficiency of out-of-tree kernel patches. Furthermore, we establish a robust benchmark using real-world out-of-tree kernel patch projects to evaluate LLM capabilities. Evaluations show that MigGPT significantly outperforms the direct application of vanilla LLMs, achieving an average completion rate of 74.07 for migration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoCaL: Countering Surface Bias in Code Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15397v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, reliable and effective code evaluation metrics (CEMs) have become crucial for progress across several software engineering tasks. While popular benchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated code, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs provide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its functional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on reporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness, the causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this work, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs, revealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code functionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these CEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally dissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this gap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117 code pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a functional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to perform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through differential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and, at the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order of magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show significant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines. Finally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to LoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to surface bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Effi: Re-Evaluating Software AI Agent System Effectiveness Under Resource Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09853v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and code agents has demonstrated significant potential to assist software engineering (SWE) tasks, such as autonomous issue resolution and feature addition. Existing AI for software engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution accuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a resource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond software engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must also be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of new metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness scores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome (e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time). In this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by re-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench benchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's effectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it integrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in a resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as the "token snowball" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of "expensive failures". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on unsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also drives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a clear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness under the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets and enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orion: Fuzzing Workflow Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15195v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzz testing is one of the most effective techniques for finding software vulnerabilities. While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor executions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to configuring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual effort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or input minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a complete fuzzing campaign. We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision. Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Some languages do not provide dedicated editors, while others offer a single native editor. The $\textit{language server protocol}$ (LSP) reduces the language-editor combinations $L \times E$ to $L + E$, where a single language server communicates with editors via LSP plugins. However, overlapping implementations of linguistic components remain an issue. Existing language workbenches struggle with modularity, reusability, and leveraging type systems for language server generation. In this work, we propose: (i) Typelang, a family of domain-specific languages for modular, composable, and reusable type system implementation, (ii) a modular language server generation process, producing servers for languages built in a modular workbench, (iii) the variant-oriented programming paradigm and a cross-artifact coordination layer to manage interdependent software variants, and (iv) an LSP plugin generator, reducing $E$ to $1$ by automating plugin creation for multiple editors. To simplify editing support for language families, each language artifact integrates its own Typelang variant, used to generate language servers. This reduces combinations to $T \times 1$, where $T = L$ represents the number of type systems. Further reuse of language artifacts across languages lowers this to $N \times 1$, where $N << T$, representing unique type systems. We implement Typelang in Neverlang, generating language servers for each artifact and LSP plugins for three editors. Empirical evaluation shows a 93.48% reduction in characters needed for type system implementation and 100% automation of LSP plugin generation, significantly lowering effort for editing support in language families, especially when artifacts are reused.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, Journal of Systems and Software, June 2025, for the replication package, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15276991</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI-assisted programming scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks. Moreover, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state of AI code generation and help developers identify the most suitable models for practical tasks. They also lay the groundwork for refining LLMs to generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Building on the original Framework for AI-driven Code Generation Evaluation (FACE), the authors retrofit the pipeline to work entirely offline through the Ollama runtime, collapsing FACE's sprawling per-problem directory tree into a handful of consolidated JSON files, and adding robust checkpointing so multi-day runs can resume after failures. The enhanced framework generates, submits, and records solutions for the full Kattis corpus of 3,589 problems across eight code-oriented models ranging from 6.7-9 billion parameters. The submission results show that the overall pass@1 accuracy is modest for the local models, with the best models performing at approximately half the acceptance rate of the proprietary models, Gemini 1.5 and ChatGPT-4. These findings expose a persistent gap between private, cost-controlled LLM deployments and state-of-the-art proprietary services, yet also highlight the rapid progress of open models and the practical benefits of an evaluation workflow that organizations can replicate on in-house hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables, accepted to CCSC Eastern 2025</p></details> |

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2025.

Originally pioneered by Netflix, CE simulates real-world failures to expose weaknesses before they impact production. In this paper, we present a systematic gray literature review that investigates how industry practitioners have adopted and adapted CE principles over recent years. Analyzing 50 sources published between 2019 and early 2024, we developed a comprehensive classification framework that extends the foundational CE principles into ten distinct concepts. Our study reveals that while the core tenets of CE remain influential, practitioners increasingly emphasize controlled experimentation, automation, and risk mitigation strategies to align with the demands of agile and continuously evolving DevOps pipelines. Our results enhance the understanding of how CE is intended and implemented in practice, and offer guidance for future research and industrial applications aimed at improving system robustness in dynamic production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025</p></details> |

We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around \$100,000 (manual annotation) to just \$5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).</p></details> | <details><summary>*Firs...</summary><p>*First three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

We introduce CARGO (Category-Aware Routing with Gap-based Optimization), a lightweight, confidence-aware framework for dynamic LLM selection. CARGO employs a single embedding-based regressor trained on LLM-judged pairwise comparisons to predict model performance, with an optional binary classifier invoked when predictions are uncertain. This two-stage design enables precise, cost-aware routing without the need for human-annotated supervision. To capture domain-specific behavior, CARGO also supports category-specific regressors trained across five task groups: mathematics, coding, reasoning, summarization, and creative writing. Evaluated on four competitive LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek V3, and Perplexity Sonar), CARGO achieves a top-1 routing accuracy of 76.4% and win rates ranging from 72% to 89% against individual experts. These results demonstrate that confidence-guided, lightweight routing can achieve expert-level performance with minimal overhead, offering a practical solution for real-world, multi-model LLM deployments.</p></details> |  |

Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |

A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025-findings https://openreview.net/forum?id=d4ICISW2T4</p></details> |

This fails to reflect the holistic context-rich nature of real-world CR. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeFuse-CR-Bench, the first comprehensiveness-aware benchmark for repository-level CR evaluation. CodeFuse-CR-Bench comprises 601 high-quality instances from 70 Python projects covering nine Pull-Request (PR) problem domains, where each instance provides rich, multi-faceted context including the associated issue, PR details, and repository state, enabling end-to-end evaluation. Beyond superficial metrics, we also propose a novel evaluation framework that combines rule-based checks for location and syntax with model-based judgments of review quality. We present the first large-scale assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on this comprehensive CR task. Our results establish crucial baselines and reveal that (1) no single LLM dominates all aspects of CR; (2) Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest comprehensive performance; and (3) different LLMs exhibit varying robustness to redundant context. These findings highlight the necessity of holistic, multi-dimensional evaluation and provide actionable insights for advancing truly intelligent yet practical CR assistants.</p></details> |  |

Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

The ability to generate code and submit pull requests with minimal human intervention, through the use of autonomous AI agents, is poised to become a standard practice. However, little is known about the practical usefulness of these pull requests and the extent to which their contributions are accepted in real-world projects. In this paper, we empirically study 567 GitHub pull requests (PRs) generated using Claude Code, an agentic coding tool, across 157 diverse open-source projects. Our analysis reveals that developers tend to rely on agents for tasks such as refactoring, documentation, and testing. The results indicate that 83.8% of these agent-assisted PRs are eventually accepted and merged by project maintainers, with 54.9% of the merged PRs are integrated without further modification. The remaining 45.1% require additional changes benefit from human revisions, especially for bug fixes, documentation, and adherence to project-specific standards. These findings suggest that while agent-assisted PRs are largely acceptable, they still benefit from human oversight and refinement.</p></details> |  |

Key to this process are agent manifests, configuration files (such as Claude.md) that provide agents with essential project context, identity, and operational rules. However, the lack of comprehensive and accessible documentation for creating these manifests presents a significant challenge for developers. We analyzed 253 Claude.md files from 242 repositories to identify structural patterns and common content. Our findings show that manifests typically have shallow hierarchies with one main heading and several subsections, with content dominated by operational commands, technical implementation notes, and high-level architecture.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files. This limitation significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics from assembly code. To address this limitation, we propose \saltm, a novel binary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared between binary and source code. The core idea of \saltm is to abstract selected binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery. Given a binary function, \saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree (\salt) from assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language. It then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed \salt to generate decompiled code. Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol recovery to improve readability and correctness. We compare \saltm to three categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercial decompilers, and decompilation methods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP, Exebench). Our experimental results demonstrate that \saltm is highly effective in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with a 10.6\% improvement). The results further validate its robustness against four commonly used obfuscation techniques. Additionally, analyses of real-world software and a user study confirm that our decompiled output offers superior assistance to human analysts in comprehending binary functions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SWE-QA: Can Language Models Answer Repository-level Code Questions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14635v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning about entire software repositories is an essential capability for intelligent software engineering tools. While existing benchmarks such as CoSQA and CodeQA have advanced the field, they predominantly focus on small, self-contained code snippets. These setups fail to capture the complexity of real-world repositories, where effective understanding and reasoning often require navigating multiple files, understanding software architecture, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. In this paper, we present SWE-QA, a repository-level code question answering (QA) benchmark designed to facilitate research on automated QA systems in realistic code environments. SWE-QA involves 576 high-quality question-answer pairs spanning diverse categories, including intention understanding, cross-file reasoning, and multi-hop dependency analysis. To construct SWE-QA, we first crawled 77,100 GitHub issues from 11 popular repositories. Based on an analysis of naturally occurring developer questions extracted from these issues, we developed a two-level taxonomy of repository-level questions and constructed a set of seed questions for each category. For each category, we manually curated and validated questions and collected their corresponding answers. As a prototype application, we further develop SWE-QA-Agent, an agentic framework in which LLM agents reason and act to find answers automatically. We evaluate six advanced LLMs on SWE-QA under various context augmentation strategies. Experimental results highlight the promise of LLMs, particularly our SWE-QA-Agent framework, in addressing repository-level QA, while also revealing open challenges and pointing to future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/peng-weihan/SWE-QA-Bench</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness of Coverage-Guided Fuzzing for Testing Deep Learning Library APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14626v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) libraries such as PyTorch provide the core components to build major AI-enabled applications. Finding bugs in these libraries is important and challenging. Prior approaches have tackled this by performing either API-level fuzzing or model-level fuzzing, but they do not use coverage guidance, which limits their effectiveness and efficiency. This raises an intriguing question: can coverage guided fuzzing (CGF), in particular frameworks like LibFuzzer, be effectively applied to DL libraries, and does it offer meaningful improvements in code coverage, bug detection, and scalability compared to prior methods? We present the first in-depth study to answer this question. A key challenge in applying CGF to DL libraries is the need to create a test harness for each API that can transform byte-level fuzzer inputs into valid API inputs. To address this, we propose FlashFuzz, a technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically synthesize API-level harnesses by combining templates, helper functions, and API documentation. FlashFuzz uses a feedback driven strategy to iteratively synthesize and repair harnesses. With this approach, FlashFuzz synthesizes harnesses for 1,151 PyTorch and 662 TensorFlow APIs. Compared to state-of-the-art fuzzing methods (ACETest, PathFinder, and TitanFuzz), FlashFuzz achieves up to 101.13 to 212.88 percent higher coverage and 1.0x to 5.4x higher validity rate, while also delivering 1x to 1182x speedups in input generation. FlashFuzz has discovered 42 previously unknown bugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 8 of which are already fixed. Our study confirms that CGF can be effectively applied to DL libraries and provides a strong baseline for future testing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Modelica Module Generation Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Building Control Description Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14623v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic energy systems and controls require advanced modeling frameworks to design and test supervisory and fault tolerant strategies. Modelica is a widely used equation based language, but developing control modules is labor intensive and requires specialized expertise. This paper examines the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of Control Description Language modules in the Building Modelica Library as a case study. We developed a structured workflow that combines standardized prompt scaffolds, library aware grounding, automated compilation with OpenModelica, and human in the loop evaluation. Experiments were carried out on four basic logic tasks (And, Or, Not, and Switch) and five control modules (chiller enable/disable, bypass valve control, cooling tower fan speed, plant requests, and relief damper control). The results showed that GPT 4o failed to produce executable Modelica code in zero shot mode, while Claude Sonnet 4 achieved up to full success for basic logic blocks with carefully engineered prompts. For control modules, success rates reached 83 percent, and failed outputs required medium level human repair (estimated one to eight hours). Retrieval augmented generation often produced mismatches in module selection (for example, And retrieved as Or), while a deterministic hard rule search strategy avoided these errors. Human evaluation also outperformed AI evaluation, since current LLMs cannot assess simulation results or validate behavioral correctness. Despite these limitations, the LLM assisted workflow reduced the average development time from 10 to 20 hours down to 4 to 6 hours per module, corresponding to 40 to 60 percent time savings. These results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LLM assisted Modelica generation, and point to future research in pre simulation validation, stronger grounding, and closed loop evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the pre-peer-review version of a journal paper; the repo is available at: https://github.com/pnnl/prompt2control</p></details> |
| **[TypedSchematics: A Block-based PCB Design Tool with Real-time Detection of Common Connection Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14576v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within PCB design, the reuse of circuit design blocks is a major preventing factor inhibiting beginners from reusing designs made by experts, a common practice in software but non-existent in circuit design at large. Despite efforts to improve reusability (e.g. block-based PCB design) by platforms such as SparkFun ALC and Altium Upverter, they lack merging techniques that safely guide users in connecting different circuit blocks without requiring assistance from third-party engineers. In this paper, we propose TypedSchematics, a block-based standalone PCB design tool that supports beginners create their own PCBs by providing a language syntax for typing circuit blocks with circuit data that addresses multiple challenges, from real-time detection of connection errors to automated composition and user-scalable libraries of circuit blocks. Through a user study, we demonstrate TypedSchematics improvements in design support for merging circuit blocks compared to Fusion 360. Three PCBs designed with TypedSchematics further showcase our tool capabilities, one designed by high school students demonstrates the potential of TypedSchematics to significantly lower the PCB design skill-floor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensembling Large Language Models for Code Vulnerability Detection: An Empirical Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12629v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code vulnerability detection is crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of modern software systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in this domain. However, notable discrepancies in detection results often arise when analyzing identical code segments across different training stages of the same model or among architecturally distinct LLMs. While such inconsistencies may compromise detection stability, they also highlight a key opportunity: the latent complementarity among models can be harnessed through ensemble learning to create more robust vulnerability detection systems. In this study, we explore the potential of ensemble learning to enhance the performance of LLMs in source code vulnerability detection. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving five LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, CodeLlama-7B, CodeLlama-13B, CodeQwen1.5-7B, and StarCoder2-15B), using three ensemble strategies (i.e., Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking). These experiments are carried out across three widely adopted datasets (i.e., Devign, ReVeal, and BigVul). Inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) techniques, we further propose Dynamic Gated Stacking (DGS), a Stacking variant tailored for vulnerability detection. Our results demonstrate that ensemble approaches can significantly improve detection performance, with Boosting excelling in scenarios involving imbalanced datasets. Moreover, DGS consistently outperforms traditional Stacking, particularly in handling class imbalance and multi-class classification tasks. These findings offer valuable insights into building more reliable and effective LLM-based vulnerability detection systems through ensemble learning.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[An LLM-based multi-agent framework for agile effort estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14483v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effort estimation is a crucial activity in agile software development, where teams collaboratively review, discuss, and estimate the effort required to complete user stories in a product backlog. Current practices in agile effort estimation heavily rely on subjective assessments, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the estimates. While recent machine learning-based methods show promising accuracy, they cannot explain or justify their estimates and lack the capability to interact with human team members. Our paper fills this significant gap by leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework for agile estimation that not only can produce estimates, but also can coordinate, communicate and discuss with human developers and other agents to reach a consensus. Evaluation results on a real-life dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across all evaluation metrics in the majority of the cases. Our human study with software development practitioners also demonstrates an overwhelmingly positive experience in collaborating with our agents in agile effort estimation.</p></details> | Submitted to ASE'25 |
| **[A Taxonomy of Prompt Defects in LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14404v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become key components of modern software, with prompts acting as their de-facto programming interface. However, prompt design remains largely empirical and small mistakes can cascade into unreliable, insecure, or inefficient behavior. This paper presents the first systematic survey and taxonomy of prompt defects, recurring ways that prompts fail to elicit their intended behavior from LLMs. We organize defects along six dimensions: (1) Specification and Intent, (2) Input and Content, (3) Structure and Formatting, (4) Context and Memory, (5) Performance and Efficiency, and (6) Maintainability and Engineering. Each dimension is refined into fine-grained subtypes, illustrated with concrete examples and root cause analysis. Grounded in software engineering principles, we show how these defects surface in real development workflows and examine their downstream effects. For every subtype, we distill mitigation strategies that span emerging prompt engineering patterns, automated guardrails, testing harnesses, and evaluation frameworks. We then summarize these strategies in a master taxonomy that links defect, impact, and remedy. We conclude with open research challenges and a call for rigorous engineering-oriented methodologies to ensure that LLM-driven systems are dependable by design.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeLSI: Leveraging Foundation Models for Automated Code Generation with Low-Rank Optimization and Domain-Specific Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14373v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Automated code generation using Foundation Models (FMs) offers promising solutions for enhancing software development efficiency. However, challenges remain in ensuring domain specificity, cost-effectiveness, and security - especially when relying on third-party APIs. This paper introduces CodeLSI, a framework that combines low-rank optimization and domain-specific instruction tuning to address these challenges. Objectives: The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate CodeLSI, a novel approach for generating high-quality code tailored to specific domains, using FMs fine-tuned on company infrastructure without dependence on external APIs. Methods: CodeLSI applies low-rank adaptation techniques to reduce the computational cost of model pre-training and fine-tuning. Domain-specific instruction tuning is employed to align code generation with organizational needs. We implemented and tested the framework on real-world JavaScript coding tasks using datasets drawn from internal software projects. Results: Experimental evaluations show that CodeLSI produces high-quality, context aware code. It outperforms baseline models in terms of relevance, accuracy, and domain fit. The use of low-rank optimization significantly reduced resource requirements, enabling scalable training on company-owned infrastructure. Conclusion: CodeLSI demonstrates that combining low-rank optimization with domain specific tuning can enhance the practicality and performance of FMs for automated code generation. This approach provides a secure, cost-efficient alternative to commercial API based solutions and supports faster, more targeted innovation in software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Review of FAIR-compliant Big Data Software Reference Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14370v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the standards of the Open Science movement, the FAIR Principles emphasize the importance of making scientific data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Yet, creating a repository that adheres to these principles presents significant challenges. Managing large volumes of diverse research data and metadata, often generated rapidly, requires a precise approach. This necessity has led to the development of Software Reference Architectures (SRAs) to guide the implementation process for FAIR-compliant repositories. This article conducts a systematic review of research efforts focused on architectural solutions for such repositories. We detail our methodology, covering all activities undertaken in the planning and execution phases of the review. We analyze 323 references from reputable sources and expert recommendations, identifying 7 studies on general-purpose big data SRAs, 13 pipelines implementing FAIR Principles in specific contexts, and 3 FAIR-compliant big data SRAs. We provide a thorough description of their key features and assess whether the research questions posed in the planning phase were adequately addressed. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of the retrieved studies and identify tendencies and opportunities for further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Illusion of Success: An Empirical Study of Build Reruns and Silent Failures in Industrial CI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14347v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliability of build outcomes is a cornerstone of effective Continuous Integration (CI). Yet in practice, developers often struggle with non-deterministic issues in the code or CI infrastructure, which undermine trust in build results. When faced with such unexpected outcomes, developers often repeatedly rerun jobs hoping for true success, but this practice is known to increase CI costs and reduce productivity. While recent studies have focused on intermittent job failures, no prior work has investigated silent failures, where build jobs are marked as successful but fail to complete all or part of their tasks. Such silent failures often go unnoticed, creating an illusion of success with detrimental consequences such as bugs escaping into production. This paper presents the first empirical study of silent failures through the practice of rerunning successful jobs. An analysis of 142,387 jobs across 81 industrial projects shows that 11% of successful jobs are rerun, with 35% of these reruns occurring after more than 24 hours. Using mixed-effects models on 32 independent variables (AUC of 85%), we identified key factors associated with reruns of successful jobs, notably testing and static analysis tasks, scripting languages like Shell, and developers prior rerun tendencies. A further analysis of 92 public issues revealed 11 categories of silent failures aligning with these factors, the most frequent being artifact operation errors, caching errors, and ignored exit codes. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the circumstances and causes of silent failures to raise awareness among teams, and present solutions to improve CI reliability.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Beyond Classification: Evaluating LLMs for Fine-Grained Automatic Malware Behavior Auditing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14335v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated malware classification has achieved strong detection performance. Yet, malware behavior auditing seeks causal and verifiable explanations of malicious activities -- essential not only to reveal what malware does but also to substantiate such claims with evidence. This task is challenging, as adversarial intent is often hidden within complex, framework-heavy applications, making manual auditing slow and costly. Large Language Models (LLMs) could help address this gap, but their auditing potential remains largely unexplored due to three limitations: (1) scarce fine-grained annotations for fair assessment; (2) abundant benign code obscuring malicious signals; and (3) unverifiable, hallucination-prone outputs undermining attribution credibility. To close this gap, we introduce MalEval, a comprehensive framework for fine-grained Android malware auditing, designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs support auditing under real-world constraints. MalEval provides expert-verified reports and an updated sensitive API list to mitigate ground truth scarcity and reduce noise via static reachability analysis. Function-level structural representations serve as intermediate attribution units for verifiable evaluation. Building on this, we define four analyst-aligned tasks -- function prioritization, evidence attribution, behavior synthesis, and sample discrimination -- together with domain-specific metrics and a unified workload-oriented score. We evaluate seven widely used LLMs on a curated dataset of recent malware and misclassified benign apps, offering the first systematic assessment of their auditing capabilities. MalEval reveals both promising potential and critical limitations across audit stages, providing a reproducible benchmark and foundation for future research on LLM-enhanced malware behavior auditing. MalEval is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengXR930/MalEval.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Effort-Optimized, Accuracy-Driven Labelling and Validation of Test Inputs for DL Systems: A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems increasingly include AI components based on deep learning (DL). Reliable testing of such systems requires near-perfect test-input validity and label accuracy, with minimal human effort. Yet, the DL community has largely overlooked the need to build highly accurate datasets with minimal effort, since DL training is generally tolerant of labelling errors. This challenge, instead, reflects concerns more familiar to software engineering, where a central goal is to construct high-accuracy test inputs, with accuracy as close to 100% as possible, while keeping associated costs in check. In this article we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. To evaluate OPAL we instantiate it for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test inputs and automated validation of test inputs. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA test-input validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active-learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using LLMs in Generating Design Rationale for Software Architecture Decisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20781v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Design Rationale (DR) for software architecture decisions refers to the reasoning underlying architectural choices, which provides valuable insights into the different phases of the architecting process throughout software development. However, in practice, DR is often inadequately documented due to a lack of motivation and effort from developers. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their capabilities in text comprehension, reasoning, and generation may enable the generation and recovery of DR for architecture decisions. In this study, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in generating DR for architecture decisions. First, we collected 50 Stack Overflow (SO) posts, 25 GitHub issues, and 25 GitHub discussions related to architecture decisions to construct a dataset of 100 architecture-related problems. Then, we selected five LLMs to generate DR for the architecture decisions with three prompting strategies, including zero-shot, chain of thought (CoT), and LLM-based agents. With the DR provided by human experts as ground truth, the Precision of LLM-generated DR with the three prompting strategies ranges from 0.267 to 0.278, Recall from 0.627 to 0.715, and F1-score from 0.351 to 0.389. Additionally, 64.45% to 69.42% of the arguments of DR not mentioned by human experts are also helpful, 4.12% to 4.87% of the arguments have uncertain correctness, and 1.59% to 3.24% of the arguments are potentially misleading. To further understand the trustworthiness and applicability of LLM-generated DR in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with six practitioners. Based on the experimental and interview results, we discussed the pros and cons of the three prompting strategies, the strengths and limitations of LLM-generated DR, and the implications for the practical use of LLM-generated DR.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 5 images, 9 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, this benefit comes with high computational costs: longer outputs increase latency, memory usage, and KV-cache demands. These issues are especially critical in software engineering tasks where concise and deterministic outputs are required. To investigate these trade-offs, we conduct an empirical study based on code generation benchmarks. The results reveal that longer CoT does not always help. Excessive reasoning often causes truncation, accuracy drops, and latency up to five times higher, with failed outputs consistently longer than successful ones. These findings challenge the assumption that longer reasoning is inherently better and highlight the need for adaptive CoT control. Motivated by this, we propose SEER (Self-Enhancing Efficient Reasoning), an adaptive framework that compresses CoT while preserving accuracy. SEER combines Best-of-N sampling with task-aware adaptive filtering, dynamically adjusting thresholds based on pre-inference outputs to reduce verbosity and computational overhead. We then evaluate SEER on three software engineering tasks and one math task. On average, SEER shortens CoT by 42.1%, improves accuracy by reducing truncation, and eliminates most infinite loops. These results demonstrate SEER as a practical method to make CoT-enhanced LLMs more efficient and robust, even under resource constraints.</p></details> |  |

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[MetaSel: A Test Selection Approach for Fine-tuned DNN Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17534v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face challenges during deployment due to covariate shift, i.e., data distribution shifts between development and deployment contexts. Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained models to new contexts requiring smaller labeled sets. However, testing fine-tuned models under constrained labeling budgets remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces MetaSel, a new approach tailored for DNN models that have been fine-tuned to address covariate shift, to select tests from unlabeled inputs. MetaSel assumes that fine-tuned and pre-trained models share related data distributions and exhibit similar behaviors for many inputs. However, their behaviors diverge within the input subspace where fine-tuning alters decision boundaries, making those inputs more prone to misclassification. Unlike general approaches that rely solely on the DNN model and its input set, MetaSel leverages information from both the fine-tuned and pre-trained models and their behavioral differences to estimate misclassification probability for unlabeled test inputs, enabling more effective test selection. Our extensive empirical evaluation, comparing MetaSel against 11 state-of-the-art approaches and involving 68 fine-tuned models across weak, medium, and strong distribution shifts, demonstrates that MetaSel consistently delivers significant improvements in Test Relative Coverage (TRC) over existing baselines, particularly under highly constrained labeling budgets. MetaSel shows average TRC improvements of 28.46% to 56.18% over the most frequent second-best baselines while maintaining a high TRC median and low variability. Our results confirm MetaSel's practicality, robustness, and cost-effectiveness for test selection in the context of fine-tuned models.</p></details> |  |

One promising avenue to improve translation accuracy is through intermediate representations, which provide structured guidance for the translation process. We investigate whether LLM-based code translation can benefit from intermediate representations, specifically in the form of natural language (NL) summaries and abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open GPT4 8X7B and specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful translations for the best-performing model (Open GPT4 8X7B) compared to the zero-shot prompt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating and Improving the Robustness of Security Attack Detectors Generated by LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18216v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development to generate functions, such as attack detectors, that implement security requirements. A key challenge is ensuring the LLMs have enough knowledge to address specific security requirements, such as information about existing attacks. For this, we propose an approach integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Self-Ranking into the LLM pipeline. RAG enhances the robustness of the output by incorporating external knowledge sources, while the Self-Ranking technique, inspired by the concept of Self-Consistency, generates multiple reasoning paths and creates ranks to select the most robust detector. Our extensive empirical study targets code generated by LLMs to detect two prevalent injection attacks in web security: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi). Results show a significant improvement in detection performance while employing RAG and Self-Ranking, with an increase of up to 71%pt (on average 37%pt) and up to 43%pt (on average 6%pt) in the F2-Score for XSS and SQLi detection, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Classical software processes such asWaterfall, V-Model, and Agile offer structured coordination patterns that can be repurposed to guide these agent interactions. [Aims] This study explores how traditional software development processes can be adapted as coordination scaffolds for LLM based MAS and examines their impact on code quality, cost, and productivity. [Method] We executed 11 diverse software projects under three process models and four GPT variants, totaling 132 runs. Each output was evaluated using standardized metrics for size (files, LOC), cost (execution time, token usage), and quality (code smells, AI- and human detected bugs). [Results] Both process model and LLM choice significantly affected system performance. Waterfall was most efficient, V-Model produced the most verbose code, and Agile achieved the highest code quality, albeit at higher computational cost. [Conclusions] Classical software processes can be effectively instantiated in LLM-based MAS, but each entails trade-offs across quality, cost, and adaptability. Process selection should reflect project goals, whether prioritizing efficiency, robustness, or structured validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on Failures in Automated Issue Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13941v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated issue solving seeks to autonomously identify and repair defective code snippets across an entire codebase. SWE-Bench has emerged as the most widely adopted benchmark for evaluating progress in this area. While LLM-based agentic tools show great promise, they still fail on a substantial portion of tasks. Moreover, current evaluations primarily report aggregate issue-solving rates, which obscure the underlying causes of success and failure, making it challenging to diagnose model weaknesses or guide targeted improvements. To bridge this gap, we first analyze the performance and efficiency of three SOTA tools, spanning both pipeline-based and agentic architectures, in automated issue solving tasks of SWE-Bench-Verified under varying task characteristics. Furthermore, to move from high-level performance metrics to underlying cause analysis, we conducted a systematic manual analysis of 150 failed instances. From this analysis, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of failure modes comprising 3 primary phases, 9 main categories, and 25 fine-grained subcategories. Then we systematically analyze the distribution of the identified failure modes, the results reveal distinct failure fingerprints between the two architectural paradigms, with the majority of agentic failures stemming from flawed reasoning and cognitive deadlocks. Motivated by these insights, we propose a collaborative Expert-Executor framework. It introduces a supervisory Expert agent tasked with providing strategic oversight and course-correction for a primary Executor agent. This architecture is designed to correct flawed reasoning and break the cognitive deadlocks that frequently lead to failure. Experiments show that our framework solves 22.2% of previously intractable issues for a leading single agent. These findings pave the way for building more robust agents through diagnostic evaluation and collaborative design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The Overlooked Ethical Dimensions of GenAI in Software Modeling Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13896v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly gaining momentum in software modeling education, embraced by both students and educators. As GenAI assists with interpreting requirements, formalizing models, and translating students' mental models into structured notations, it increasingly shapes core learning outcomes such as domain comprehension, diagrammatic thinking, and modeling fluency without clear ethical oversight or pedagogical guidelines. Yet, the ethical implications of this integration remain underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review across six major digital libraries in computer science (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Web of Science). Our aim is to identify studies discussing the ethical aspects of GenAI in software modeling education, including responsibility, fairness, transparency, diversity, and inclusion among others. Out of 1,386 unique papers initially retrieved, only three explicitly addressed ethical considerations. This scarcity highlights the critical absence of ethical discourse surrounding GenAI in modeling education and raises urgent questions about the responsible integration of AI in modeling curricula, as well as it evinces the pressing need for structured ethical frameworks in this emerging educational landscape. We examine these three studies and explore the emerging research opportunities as well as the challenges that have arisen in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Educators Symposium at MODELS 2025</p></details> |

Evaluating Prompt-Based Large Language Models (LLM)s for Software Requirements Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13868v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements classification assigns natural language requirements to predefined classes, such as functional and non functional. Accurate classification reduces risk and improves software quality. Most existing models rely on supervised learning, which needs large labeled data that are costly, slow to create, and domain dependent; they also generalize poorly and often require retraining for each task. This study tests whether prompt based large language models can reduce data needs. We benchmark several models and prompting styles (zero shot, few shot, persona, and chain of thought) across multiple tasks on two English datasets, PROMISE and SecReq. For each task we compare model prompt configurations and then compare the best LLM setups with a strong fine tuned transformer baseline. Results show that prompt based LLMs, especially with few shot prompts, can match or exceed the baseline. Adding a persona, or persona plus chain of thought, can yield further gains. We conclude that prompt based LLMs are a practical and scalable option that reduces dependence on large annotations and can improve generalizability across tasks.</p></details> | 33 pages, 12 figures |

A common approach to mitigating this issue is trace sampling, which selectively retains traces based on specific criteria, often preserving only anomalous ones. However, this method frequently discards valuable information, including normal traces that are essential for comparative analysis. To address this limitation, we introduce Trace Sampling 2.0, which operates at the span level while maintaining trace structure consistency. This approach allows for the retention of all traces while significantly reducing storage overhead. Based on this concept, we design and implement Autoscope, a span-level sampling method that leverages static analysis to extract execution logic, ensuring that critical spans are preserved without compromising structural integrity. We evaluated Autoscope on two open-source microservices. Our results show that it reduces trace size by 81.2% while maintaining 98.1% faulty span coverage, outperforming existing trace-level sampling methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness in root cause analysis, achieving an average improvement of 8.3%. These findings indicate that Autoscope can significantly enhance observability and storage efficiency in microservices, offering a robust solution for performance monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, which primarily rely on large language models (LLMs), are hindered by semantic ambiguities, limited understanding of structural context, and insufficient reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose KGCompass with two innovations: (1) a novel repository-aware knowledge graph (KG) that accurately links repository artifacts (issues and pull requests) and codebase entities (files, classes, and functions), allowing us to effectively narrow down the vast search space to only 20 most relevant functions with accurate candidate fault locations and contextual information, and (2) a path-guided repair mechanism that leverages KG-mined entity paths, tracing through which allows us to augment LLMs with relevant contextual information to generate precise patches along with their explanations. Experimental results in the SWE-bench Lite demonstrate that KGCompass achieves state-of-the-art single-LLM repair performance (58.3%) and function-level fault location accuracy (56.0%) across open-source approaches with a single repair model, costing only $0.2 per repair. Among the bugs that KGCompass successfully localizes, 89.7% lack explicit location hints in the issue and are found only through multi-hop graph traversal, where pure LLMs struggle to locate bugs accurately. Relative to pure-LLM baselines, KGCompass lifts the resolved rate by 50.8% on Claude-4 Sonnet, 30.2% on Claude-3.5 Sonnet, 115.7% on DeepSeek-V3, and 156.4% on Qwen2.5 Max. These consistent improvements demonstrate that this graph-guided repair framework delivers model-agnostic, cost-efficient repair and sets a strong new baseline for repository-level repair.</p></details> |  |

Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Study on Thinking Patterns of Large Reasoning Models in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13758v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, many large language models (LLMs) are utilized for software engineering tasks such as code generation. The emergence of more advanced models known as large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o3, DeepSeek R1, and Qwen3. They have demonstrated the capability of performing multi-step reasoning. Despite the advancement in LRMs, little attention has been paid to systematically analyzing the reasoning patterns these models exhibit and how such patterns influence the generated code. This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at investigating and uncovering the reasoning behavior of LRMs during code generation. We prompted several state-of-the-art LRMs of varying sizes with code generation tasks and applied open coding to manually annotate the reasoning traces. From this analysis, we derive a taxonomy of LRM reasoning behaviors, encompassing 15 reasoning actions across four phases. Our empirical study based on the taxonomy reveals a series of findings. First, we identify common reasoning patterns, showing that LRMs generally follow a human-like coding workflow, with more complex tasks eliciting additional actions such as scaffolding, flaw detection, and style checks. Second, we compare reasoning across models, finding that Qwen3 exhibits iterative reasoning while DeepSeek-R1-7B follows a more linear, waterfall-like approach. Third, we analyze the relationship between reasoning and code correctness, showing that actions such as unit test creation and scaffold generation strongly support functional outcomes, with LRMs adapting strategies based on task context. Finally, we evaluate lightweight prompting strategies informed by these findings, demonstrating the potential of context- and reasoning-oriented prompts to improve LRM-generated code. Our results offer insights and practical implications for advancing automatic code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scrub It Out! Erasing Sensitive Memorization in Code Language Models via Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13755v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated superior performance in software engineering tasks such as code generation and summarization, recent empirical studies reveal a critical privacy vulnerability: these models exhibit unintended memorization of sensitive training data, enabling verbatim reproduction of confidential information when specifically prompted. To address this issue, several approaches, including training data de-duplication and differential privacy augmentation, have been proposed. However, these methods require full-model retraining for deployed CLMs, which incurs substantial computational costs. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research question: Can sensitive information memorized by CLMs be erased effectively and efficiently? We conduct a pioneering investigation into erasing sensitive memorization in CLMs through machine unlearning - a post-hoc modification method that removes specific information from trained models without requiring full retraining. Specifically, we first quantify the memorization risks of sensitive data within CLM training datasets and curate a high-risk dataset of 50,000 sensitive memorized samples as unlearning targets. We study two widely used gradient ascent-based unlearning approaches: the vanilla and constraint-based methods, and introduce CodeEraser, an advanced variant that selectively unlearns sensitive memorized segments in code while preserving the structural integrity and functional correctness of the surrounding code. Extensive experiments on three families of CLMs, i.e., CodeParrot, CodeGen-Mono, and Qwen2.5-Coder, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of CodeEraser in erasing targeted sensitive memorization while maintaining model utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |
| **[SynthCoder: A Synthetical Strategy to Tune LLMs for Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15495v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfraMind: A Novel Exploration-based GUI Agentic Framework for Mission-critical Industrial Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13704v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mission-critical industrial infrastructure, such as data centers, increasingly depends on complex management software. Its operations, however, pose significant challenges due to the escalating system complexity, multi-vendor integration, and a shortage of expert operators. While Robotic Process Automation (RPA) offers partial automation through handcrafted scripts, it suffers from limited flexibility and high maintenance costs. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based graphical user interface (GUI) agents have enabled more flexible automation, yet these general-purpose agents face five critical challenges when applied to industrial management, including unfamiliar element understanding, precision and efficiency, state localization, deployment constraints, and safety requirements. To address these issues, we propose InfraMind, a novel exploration-based GUI agentic framework specifically tailored for industrial management systems. InfraMind integrates five innovative modules to systematically resolve different challenges in industrial management: (1) systematic search-based exploration with virtual machine snapshots for autonomous understanding of complex GUIs; (2) memory-driven planning to ensure high-precision and efficient task execution; (3) advanced state identification for robust localization in hierarchical interfaces; (4) structured knowledge distillation for efficient deployment with lightweight models; and (5) comprehensive, multi-layered safety mechanisms to safeguard sensitive operations. Extensive experiments on both open-source and commercial DCIM platforms demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing frameworks in terms of task success rate and operational efficiency, providing a rigorous and scalable solution for industrial management automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Threaded Software Model Checking via Parallel Trace Abstraction Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13699v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software verification is a valuable means for software quality assurance. However, automatic verification and in particular software model checking can be time-consuming, which hinders their practical applicability e.g., the use in continuous integration. One solution to address the issue is to reduce the response time of the verification procedure by leveraging today's multi-core CPUs. In this paper, we propose a solution to parallelize trace abstraction, an abstraction-based approach to software model checking. The underlying idea of our approach is to parallelize the abstraction refinement. More concretely, our approach analyzes different traces (syntactic program paths) that could violate the safety property in parallel. We realize our parallelized version of trace abstraction in the verification tool Ulti mate Automizer and perform a thorough evaluation. Our evaluation shows that our parallelization is more effective than sequential trace abstraction and can provide results significantly faster on many time-consuming tasks. Also, our approach is more effective than DSS, a recent parallel approach to abstraction-based software model checking.</p></details> |  |

Identical requirements expressed with different emotions or communication styles can yield divergent outputs, while most benchmarks emphasize only peak performance. We present PromptSE (Prompt Sensitivity Evaluation), a framework that creates semantically equivalent prompt variants with emotion and personality templates, and that evaluates stability using probability aware continuous scoring or using binary pass rates when logits are unavailable. The results are aggregated into a proposed area under curve metric (AUC-E) for cross model comparison. Across 14 models from three families (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek), our study shows that performance and stability behave as largely decoupled optimization objectives, and it reveals architectural and scale related patterns that challenge common assumptions about model robustness. The framework supports rapid screening for closed-source models as well as detailed stability analysis in research settings. PromptSE enables practitioners to quantify performance stability trade offs for deployment and model selection, positioning prompt stability as a complementary evaluation dimension alongside performance and fairness, and contributing to more trustworthy AI-assisted software development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Regression Testing Framework with Automated Assertion Generation for Machine Learning Notebooks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13656v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Notebooks have become the de-facto choice for data scientists and machine learning engineers for prototyping and experimenting with machine learning (ML) pipelines. Notebooks provide an interactive interface for code, data, and visualization. However, notebooks provide very limited support for testing. Thus, during continuous development, many subtle bugs that do not lead to crashes often go unnoticed and cause silent errors that manifest as performance regressions. To address this, we introduce NBTest - the first regression testing framework that allows developers to write cell-level assertions in notebooks and run such notebooks in pytest or in continuous integration (CI) pipelines. NBTest offers a library of assertion APIs, and a JupyterLab plugin that enables executing assertions. We also develop the first automated approach for generating cell-level assertions for key components in ML notebooks, such as data processing, model building, and model evaluation. NBTest aims to improve the reliability and maintainability of ML notebooks without adding developer burden. We evaluate NBTest on 592 Kaggle notebooks. Overall, NBTest generates 21163 assertions (35.75 on average per notebook). The generated assertions obtain a mutation score of 0.57 in killing ML-specific mutations. NBTest can catch regression bugs in previous versions of the Kaggle notebooks using assertions generated for the latest versions. Because ML pipelines involve non deterministic computations, the assertions can be flaky. Hence, we also show how NBTest leverages statistical techniques to minimize flakiness while retaining high fault-detection effectiveness. NBTest has been adopted in the CI of a popular ML library. Further, we perform a user study with 17 participants that shows that notebook users find NBTest intuitive (Rating 4.3/5) and useful in writing assertions and testing notebooks (Rating 4.24/5).</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of GitHub Copilot's recently introduced code review feature in detecting security vulnerabilities. Using a curated set of labeled vulnerable code samples drawn from diverse open-source projects spanning multiple programming languages and application domains, we systematically assessed Copilot's ability to identify and provide feedback on common security flaws. Contrary to expectations, our results reveal that Copilot's code review frequently fails to detect critical vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure deserialization. Instead, its feedback primarily addresses low-severity issues, such as coding style and typographical errors. These findings expose a significant gap between the perceived capabilities of AI-assisted code review and its actual effectiveness in supporting secure development practices. Our results highlight the continued necessity of dedicated security tools and manual code audits to ensure robust software security.</p></details> |  |

Runtime issues, such as changes in data patterns or operating contexts, that degrade model performance are a common occurrence in production settings. Monitoring enables early detection and mitigation of these runtime issues, helping maintain users' trust and prevent unwanted consequences for organizations. Aim: This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ML monitoring literature. Method: We conducted a multivocal literature review (MLR) following the well established guidelines by Garousi to investigate various aspects of ML monitoring approaches in 136 papers. Results: We analyzed selected studies based on four key areas: (1) the motivations, goals, and context; (2) the monitored aspects, specific techniques, metrics, and tools; (3) the contributions and benefits; and (4) the current limitations. We also discuss several insights found in the studies, their implications, and recommendations for future research and practice. Conclusion: Our MLR identifies and summarizes ML monitoring practices and gaps, emphasizing similarities and disconnects between formal and gray literature. Our study is valuable for both academics and practitioners, as it helps select appropriate solutions, highlights limitations in current approaches, and provides future directions for research and tool development.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffGAN: A Test Generation Approach for Differential Testing of Deep Neural Networks for Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19794v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across applications. However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |

We present Prompt2DAG, a methodology that transforms natural language descriptions into executable Apache Airflow DAGs. We evaluate four generation approaches -- Direct, LLM-only, Hybrid, and Template-based -- across 260 experiments using thirteen LLMs and five case studies to identify optimal strategies for production-grade automation. Performance is measured using a penalized scoring framework that combines reliability with code quality (SAT), structural integrity (DST), and executability (PCT). The Hybrid approach emerges as the optimal generative method, achieving a 78.5% success rate with robust quality scores (SAT: 6.79, DST: 7.67, PCT: 7.76). This significantly outperforms the LLM-only (66.2% success) and Direct (29.2% success) methods. Our findings show that reliability, not intrinsic code quality, is the primary differentiator. Cost-effectiveness analysis reveals the Hybrid method is over twice as efficient as Direct prompting per successful DAG. We conclude that a structured, hybrid approach is essential for balancing flexibility and reliability in automated workflow generation, offering a viable path to democratize data pipeline development.</p></details> |  |

We present an agentic approach for developing legal-critical software, using U.S. federal tax preparation as a case study. The key challenge is test-case generation under the oracle problem, where correct outputs require interpreting law. Building on metamorphic testing, we introduce higher-order metamorphic relations that compare system outputs across structured shifts among similar individuals. Because authoring such relations is tedious and error-prone, we use an LLM-driven, role-based framework to automate test generation and code synthesis. We implement a multi-agent system that translates tax code into executable software and incorporates a metamorphic-testing agent that searches for counterexamples. In experiments, our framework using a smaller model (GPT-4o-mini) achieves a worst-case pass rate of 45%, outperforming frontier models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, 9-15%) on complex tax-code tasks. These results support agentic LLM methodologies as a path to robust, trustworthy legal-critical software from natural-language specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICSE 26. 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Is Research Software Science a Metascience?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13436v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As research increasingly relies on computational methods, the reliability of scientific results depends on the quality, reproducibility, and transparency of research software. Ensuring these qualities is critical for scientific integrity and discovery. This paper asks whether Research Software Science (RSS)--the empirical study of how research software is developed and used--should be considered a form of metascience, the science of science. Classification matters because it could affect recognition, funding, and integration of RSS into research improvement. We define metascience and RSS, compare their principles and objectives, and examine their overlaps. Arguments for classification highlight shared commitments to reproducibility, transparency, and empirical study of research processes. Arguments against portraying RSS as a specialized domain focused on a tool rather than the broader scientific enterprise. Our analysis finds RSS advances core goals of metascience, especially in computational reproducibility, and bridges technical, social, and cognitive aspects of research. Its classification depends on whether one adopts a broad definition of metascience--any empirical effort to improve science--or a narrow one focused on systemic and epistemological structures. We argue RSS is best understood as a distinct interdisciplinary domain that aligns with, and in some definitions fits within, metascience. Recognizing it as such can strengthen its role in improving reliability, justify funding, and elevate software development in research institutions. Regardless of classification, applying scientific rigor to research software ensures the tools of discovery meet the standards of the discoveries themselves.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, in practice, good performance of an application is viewed as more of a binary function - either the application responds in under, say 100 ms, and is fast enough for a user to barely notice, or it takes a noticeable amount of time, leaving the user waiting and potentially abandoning the task. Thus, performance really means how often the application is fast enough to be usable, leading industrial developers to focus on the 95th and 99th percentile tail-latencies as heavily, or moreso, than average response time. Our vision is to create a software stack that actively supports these needs via programming language and runtime system design. In this paper we present a novel garbage-collector design, the Catalpa collector, for the Bosque programming language and runtime. This allocator is designed to minimize latency and variability while maintaining high-throughput and incurring small memory overheads. To achieve these goals we leverage various features of the Bosque language, including immutability and reference-cycle freedom, to construct a collector that has bounded collection pauses, incurs fixed-constant memory overheads, and does not require any barriers or synchronization with application code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of Programmers' Trust in Generative AI Programming Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13253v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation. Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Towards the Next Generation of Software: Insights from Grey Literature on AI-Native Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13144v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to AI-native applications, a new paradigm in software engineering that fundamentally redefines how software is designed, developed, and evolved. Despite their growing prominence, AI-native applications still lack a unified engineering definition and architectural blueprint, leaving practitioners without systematic guidance for system design, quality assurance, and technology selection. Objective: This study seeks to establish a comprehensive understanding of AI-native applications by identifying their defining characteristics, key quality attributes, and typical technology stacks, as well as by clarifying the opportunities and challenges they present. Method: We conducted a grey literature review, integrating conceptual perspectives retrieved from targeted Google and Bing searches with practical insights derived from leading open-source projects on GitHub. A structured protocol encompassing source selection, quality assessment, and thematic analysis was applied to synthesize findings across heterogeneous sources. Results: We finally identified 106 studies based on the selection criteria. The analysis reveals that AI-native applications are distinguished by two core pillars: the central role of AI as the system's intelligence paradigm and their inherently probabilistic, non-deterministic nature. Critical quality attributes include reliability, usability, performance efficiency, and AI-specific observability. In addition, a typical technology stack has begun to emerge, comprising LLM orchestration frameworks, vector databases, and AI-native observability platforms. These systems emphasize response quality, cost-effectiveness, and outcome predictability, setting them apart from conventional software systems. Conclusion: This study is the first to propose a dual-layered engineering blueprint...</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Code Embeddings and ML Classifiers for Python Source Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13134v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the growing complexity and scale of source code have rendered manual software vulnerability detection increasingly impractical. To address this challenge, automated approaches leveraging machine learning and code embeddings have gained substantial attention. This study investigates the optimal combination of code embedding techniques and machine learning classifiers for vulnerability detection in Python source code. We evaluate three embedding techniques, i.e., Word2Vec, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT alongside two deep learning classifiers, i.e., Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While CNN paired with GraphCodeBERT exhibits strong performance, the BiLSTM model using Word2Vec consistently achieves superior overall results. These findings suggest that, despite the advanced architectures of recent models like CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT, classical embeddings such as Word2Vec, when used with sequence-based models like BiLSTM, can offer a slight yet consistent performance advantage. The study underscores the critical importance of selecting appropriate combinations of embeddings and classifiers to enhance the effectiveness of automated vulnerability detection systems, particularly for Python source code.</p></details> |  |

This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly 3.9$\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\times$ other baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MatchFixAgent: Language-Agnostic Autonomous Repository-Level Code Translation Validation and Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16187v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms source code from one programming language (PL) to another. Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |

However, specific bug reports experience unusually long resolution times, which may indicate underlying process inefficiencies or complex issues. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of bug resolution anomalies across seven prominent open-source repositories: Cassandra, Firefox, Hadoop, HBase, SeaMonkey, Spark, and Thunderbird. Utilizing statistical methods such as Z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR), we identify anomalies in bug resolution durations. To understand the thematic nature of these anomalies, we apply Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for textual feature extraction and KMeans clustering to group similar bug summaries. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across projects, with anomalies often clustering around test failures, enhancement requests, and user interface issues. This approach provides actionable insights for project maintainers to prioritize and effectively address long-standing bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 tables, 21 figures</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions.

This study aims to assist Machine Learning (ML) engineers in enhancing their code by identifying and correcting Data Leakage issues within their models. Data Leakage occurs when information from the test dataset is inadvertently included in the training data when preparing a data science model, resulting in misleading performance evaluations. ML developers must carefully separate their data into training, evaluation, and test sets to avoid introducing Data Leakage into their code. In this paper, we develop a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension, called LeakageDetector, that detects Data Leakage, mainly Overlap, Preprocessing and Multi-test leakage, from Jupyter Notebook files. Beyond detection, we included two correction mechanisms: a conventional approach, known as a quick fix, which manually fixes the leakage, and an LLM-driven approach that guides ML developers toward best practices for building ML pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThermalGuardian: Temperature-Aware Testing of Automotive Deep Learning Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15815v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems, supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Are We? An Empirical Analysis of Current Vulnerability Localization Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15777v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source software vulnerability patch detection is a critical component for maintaining software security and ensuring software supply chain integrity. Traditional manual detection methods face significant scalability challenges when processing large volumes of commit histories, while being prone to human errors and omissions. Existing automated approaches, including heuristic-based methods and pre-trained model solutions, suffer from limited accuracy, poor generalization capabilities, and inherent methodological constraints that hinder their practical deployment. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study of existing vulnerability patch detection methods, revealing four key insights that guide the design of effective solutions: the critical impact of search space reduction, the superiority of pre-trained semantic understanding over architectural complexity, the temporal limitations of web crawling approaches, and the advantages of knowledge-driven methods. Based on these insights, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines version-driven candidate filtering with large language model-based multi-round dialogue voting to achieve accurate and efficient vulnerability patch identification. Extensive experiments on a dataset containing 750 real vulnerabilities demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches.</p></details> |  |

Yet this code is unsuitable for formal verification due to side effects, mutable state, concurrency, and legacy design. A standalone formal specification would enable verification both across versions of the reference client and against new client implementations, strengthening decentralization by reducing the risk of consensus-splitting bugs. Yet such a specification has long been considered intractable given the complexity of Bitcoin's consensus logic. We demonstrate a compact, executable, declarative C++ specification of Bitcoin consensus rules that syncs mainnet to tip in a few hours on a single thread. We also introduce the Hornet Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to encode these rules unambiguously for execution, enabling formal reasoning, consensus code generation, and AI-driven adversarial testing. Our spec-driven client Hornet Node offers a modern and modular complement to the reference client. Its clear, idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns, supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.</p></details> |  |

Maintaining and updating these patches across different kernel versions demands significant effort from experienced engineers. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across various domains, suggesting their potential for automating out-of-tree kernel patch migration. However, our findings reveal that LLMs, while promising, struggle with incomplete code context understanding and inaccurate migration point identification. In this work, we propose MigGPT, a framework that employs a novel code fingerprint structure to retain code snippet information and incorporates three meticulously designed modules to improve the migration accuracy and efficiency of out-of-tree kernel patches. Furthermore, we establish a robust benchmark using real-world out-of-tree kernel patch projects to evaluate LLM capabilities. Evaluations show that MigGPT significantly outperforms the direct application of vanilla LLMs, achieving an average completion rate of 74.07 for migration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoCaL: Countering Surface Bias in Code Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15397v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, reliable and effective code evaluation metrics (CEMs) have become crucial for progress across several software engineering tasks. While popular benchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated code, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs provide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its functional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on reporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness, the causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this work, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs, revealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code functionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these CEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally dissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this gap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117 code pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a functional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to perform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through differential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and, at the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order of magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show significant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines. Finally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to LoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to surface bias.</p></details> |  |

While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor executions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to configuring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual effort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or input minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a complete fuzzing campaign. We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision. Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Some languages do not provide dedicated editors, while others offer a single native editor. The $\textit{language server protocol}$ (LSP) reduces the language-editor combinations $L \times E$ to $L + E$, where a single language server communicates with editors via LSP plugins. However, overlapping implementations of linguistic components remain an issue. Existing language workbenches struggle with modularity, reusability, and leveraging type systems for language server generation. In this work, we propose: (i) Typelang, a family of domain-specific languages for modular, composable, and reusable type system implementation, (ii) a modular language server generation process, producing servers for languages built in a modular workbench, (iii) the variant-oriented programming paradigm and a cross-artifact coordination layer to manage interdependent software variants, and (iv) an LSP plugin generator, reducing $E$ to $1$ by automating plugin creation for multiple editors. To simplify editing support for language families, each language artifact integrates its own Typelang variant, used to generate language servers. This reduces combinations to $T \times 1$, where $T = L$ represents the number of type systems. Further reuse of language artifacts across languages lowers this to $N \times 1$, where $N << T$, representing unique type systems. We implement Typelang in Neverlang, generating language servers for each artifact and LSP plugins for three editors. Empirical evaluation shows a 93.48% reduction in characters needed for type system implementation and 100% automation of LSP plugin generation, significantly lowering effort for editing support in language families, especially when artifacts are reused.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, Journal of Systems and Software, June 2025, for the replication package, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15276991</p></details> |

This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to assist Machine Learning (ML) engineers in enhancing their code by identifying and correcting Data Leakage issues within their models. Data Leakage occurs when information from the test dataset is inadvertently included in the training data when preparing a data science model, resulting in misleading performance evaluations. ML developers must carefully separate their data into training, evaluation, and test sets to avoid introducing Data Leakage into their code. In this paper, we develop a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension, called LeakageDetector, that detects Data Leakage, mainly Overlap, Preprocessing and Multi-test leakage, from Jupyter Notebook files. Beyond detection, we included two correction mechanisms: a conventional approach, known as a quick fix, which manually fixes the leakage, and an LLM-driven approach that guides ML developers toward best practices for building ML pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Omitted Variable Bias in Empirical Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17026v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omitted variable bias occurs when a statistical model leaves out variables that are relevant determinants of the effects under study. This results in the model attributing the missing variables' effect to some of the included variables -- hence over- or under-estimating the latter's true effect. Omitted variable bias presents a significant threat to the validity of empirical research, particularly in non-experimental studies such as those prevalent in empirical software engineering. This paper illustrates the impact of omitted variable bias on two case studies in the software engineering domain, and uses them to present methods to investigate the possible presence of omitted variable bias, to estimate its impact, and to mitigate its drawbacks. The analysis techniques we present are based on causal structural models of the variables of interest, which provide a practical, intuitive summary of the key relations among variables. This paper demonstrates a sequence of analysis steps that inform the design and execution of any empirical study in software engineering. An important observation is that it pays off to invest effort investigating omitted variable bias before actually executing an empirical study, because this effort can lead to a more solid study design, and to a significant reduction in its threats to validity.</p></details> |  |

| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly 3.9$\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\times$ other baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MatchFixAgent: Language-Agnostic Autonomous Repository-Level Code Translation Validation and Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16187v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms source code from one programming language (PL) to another. Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |

However, specific bug reports experience unusually long resolution times, which may indicate underlying process inefficiencies or complex issues. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of bug resolution anomalies across seven prominent open-source repositories: Cassandra, Firefox, Hadoop, HBase, SeaMonkey, Spark, and Thunderbird. Utilizing statistical methods such as Z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR), we identify anomalies in bug resolution durations. To understand the thematic nature of these anomalies, we apply Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for textual feature extraction and KMeans clustering to group similar bug summaries. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across projects, with anomalies often clustering around test failures, enhancement requests, and user interface issues. This approach provides actionable insights for project maintainers to prioritize and effectively address long-standing bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 tables, 21 figures</p></details> |

By using Ginkgo, applications are able to ease the transition to modern systems, and speed up their simulations through faster numerical linear algebra routines.

Functional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a standard technique used within Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to identify software failures and assess their consequences. Simulation-driven approaches have recently been shown to be effective in supporting FMEA. However, industries need evidence of the effectiveness of these approaches to increase practical adoption. This industrial paper presents our experience with using FMEA to analyze the safety of a CPS from the e-Bike domain. We used Simulink Fault Analyzer, an industrial tool that supports engineers with FMEA. We identified 13 realistic faults, modeled them, and analyzed their effects. We sought expert feedback to analyze the appropriateness of our models and the effectiveness of the faults in detecting safety breaches. Our results reveal that for the faults we identified, our models were accurate or contained minor imprecision that we subsequently corrected. They also confirm that FMEA helps engineers improve their models. Specifically, the output provided by the simulation-driven support for 38.4% (5 out of 13) of the faults did not match the engineers' expectations, helping them discover unexpected effects of the faults. We present a thorough discussion of our results and ten lessons learned. Our findings are useful for software engineers who work as Simulink engineers, use the Simulink Fault Analyzer, or work as safety analysts.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems. We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this conceptual framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThermalGuardian: Temperature-Aware Testing of Automotive Deep Learning Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15815v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems, supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Are We? An Empirical Analysis of Current Vulnerability Localization Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15777v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source software vulnerability patch detection is a critical component for maintaining software security and ensuring software supply chain integrity. Traditional manual detection methods face significant scalability challenges when processing large volumes of commit histories, while being prone to human errors and omissions. Existing automated approaches, including heuristic-based methods and pre-trained model solutions, suffer from limited accuracy, poor generalization capabilities, and inherent methodological constraints that hinder their practical deployment. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study of existing vulnerability patch detection methods, revealing four key insights that guide the design of effective solutions: the critical impact of search space reduction, the superiority of pre-trained semantic understanding over architectural complexity, the temporal limitations of web crawling approaches, and the advantages of knowledge-driven methods. Based on these insights, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines version-driven candidate filtering with large language model-based multi-round dialogue voting to achieve accurate and efficient vulnerability patch identification. Extensive experiments on a dataset containing 750 real vulnerabilities demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adversarial Robust Behavior Sequence Anomaly Detection Approach Based on Critical Behavior Unit Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15756v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential deep learning models (e.g., RNN and LSTM) can learn the sequence features of software behaviors, such as API or syscall sequences. However, recent studies have shown that these deep learning-based approaches are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Attackers can use adversarial samples to change the sequential characteristics of behavior sequences and mislead malware classifiers. In this paper, an adversarial robustness anomaly detection method based on the analysis of behavior units is proposed to overcome this problem. We extract related behaviors that usually perform a behavior intention as a behavior unit, which contains the representative semantic information of local behaviors and can be used to improve the robustness of behavior analysis. By learning the overall semantics of each behavior unit and the contextual relationships among behavior units based on a multilevel deep learning model, our approach can mitigate perturbation attacks that target local and large-scale behaviors. In addition, our approach can be applied to both low-level and high-level behavior logs (e.g., API and syscall logs). The experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the compared methods, which indicates that our approach has better performance against obfuscation attacks.</p></details> |  |

Yet this code is unsuitable for formal verification due to side effects, mutable state, concurrency, and legacy design. A standalone formal specification would enable verification both across versions of the reference client and against new client implementations, strengthening decentralization by reducing the risk of consensus-splitting bugs. Yet such a specification has long been considered intractable given the complexity of Bitcoin's consensus logic. We demonstrate a compact, executable, declarative C++ specification of Bitcoin consensus rules that syncs mainnet to tip in a few hours on a single thread. We also introduce the Hornet Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to encode these rules unambiguously for execution, enabling formal reasoning, consensus code generation, and AI-driven adversarial testing. Our spec-driven client Hornet Node offers a modern and modular complement to the reference client. Its clear, idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns, supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to token selection during decoding, particularly at decision points where uncertainty strongly affects program correctness. Conventional strategies such as greedy decoding treat all tokens uniformly and fail to capture the uncertainty characteristics unique to code, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis and show that a large fraction of generation errors arises from token misranking at high-uncertainty positions, where the correct token is available but not prioritized. To address this, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework that employs a lookahead-based, uncertainty-aware pause-and-rerank mechanism. AdaDec automatically learns model-specific uncertainty thresholds and selectively invokes reranking when high uncertainty is detected, leveraging lookahead to refine token choice. Across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and DevEval benchmarks, AdaDec yields substantial improvements, achieving up to 20.9% absolute gains in Pass@1 accuracy compared with greedy decoding, while consistently outperforming prior adaptive decoding approaches such as AdapT. Furthermore, by applying reranking only when necessary, AdaDec reduces computational overhead and latency, enhancing efficiency alongside reliability. These findings underscore the value of uncertainty-guided decoding strategies in advancing the robustness and practicality of LLM-based code generation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |
| **[An MLIR-Based Compilation Framework for Control Flow Management on Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02167v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) present both high flexibility and efficiency, making them well-suited for the acceleration of intensive workloads. Nevertheless, a key barrier towards their widespread adoption is posed by CGRA compilation, which must cope with a multi-dimensional space spanning both the spatial and the temporal domains. Indeed, state-of-the-art compilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of applications, while having little or no support for control flow. Hence, they mostly target the mapping of single loops and/or delegate the management of control flow divergences to ad-hoc hardware units. Conversely, in this paper we show that control flow can be effectively managed and optimized at the compilation level, allowing for a broad set of applications to be targeted while being hardware-agnostic and achieving high performance. We embody our methodology in a modular compilation framework consisting of transformation and optimization passes, enabling support for applications with arbitrary control flows running on abstract CGRA meshes. We also introduce a novel mapping methodology that acts as a compilation back-end, addressing the limitations in available CGRA hardware resources and guaranteeing a feasible solution in the compilation process. Our framework achieves up to 2.1X speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, purely through compilation optimizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Brevity is the Soul of Wit: Condensing Code Changes to Improve Commit Message Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15567v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commit messages are valuable resources for describing why code changes are committed to repositories in version control systems (e.g., Git). They effectively help developers understand code changes and better perform software maintenance tasks. Unfortunately, developers often neglect to write high-quality commit messages in practice. Therefore, a growing body of work is proposed to generate commit messages automatically. These works all demonstrated that how to organize and represent code changes is vital in generating good commit messages, including the use of fine-grained graphs or embeddings to better represent code changes. In this study, we choose an alternative way to condense code changes before generation, i.e., proposing brief yet concise text templates consisting of the following three parts: (1) summarized code changes, (2) elicited comments, and (3) emphasized code identifiers. Specifically, we first condense code changes by using our proposed templates with the help of a heuristic-based tool named ChangeScribe, and then fine-tune CodeLlama-7B on the pairs of our proposed templates and corresponding commit messages. Our proposed templates better utilize pre-trained language models, while being naturally brief and readable to complement generated commit messages for developers. Our evaluation based on a widely used dataset showed that our approach can outperform six baselines in terms of BLEU-Norm, METEOR, and ROUGE-L, with average improvements of 51.7%, 78.7%, and 62.5%, respectively. The ablation study and human evaluation also provide further insights into the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Maintaining and updating these patches across different kernel versions demands significant effort from experienced engineers. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across various domains, suggesting their potential for automating out-of-tree kernel patch migration. However, our findings reveal that LLMs, while promising, struggle with incomplete code context understanding and inaccurate migration point identification. In this work, we propose MigGPT, a framework that employs a novel code fingerprint structure to retain code snippet information and incorporates three meticulously designed modules to improve the migration accuracy and efficiency of out-of-tree kernel patches. Furthermore, we establish a robust benchmark using real-world out-of-tree kernel patch projects to evaluate LLM capabilities. Evaluations show that MigGPT significantly outperforms the direct application of vanilla LLMs, achieving an average completion rate of 74.07 for migration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoCaL: Countering Surface Bias in Code Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15397v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, reliable and effective code evaluation metrics (CEMs) have become crucial for progress across several software engineering tasks. While popular benchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated code, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs provide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its functional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on reporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness, the causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this work, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs, revealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code functionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these CEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally dissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this gap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117 code pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a functional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to perform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through differential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and, at the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order of magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show significant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines. Finally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to LoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to surface bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Effi: Re-Evaluating Software AI Agent System Effectiveness Under Resource Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09853v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and code agents has demonstrated significant potential to assist software engineering (SWE) tasks, such as autonomous issue resolution and feature addition. Existing AI for software engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution accuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a resource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond software engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must also be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of new metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness scores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome (e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time). In this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by re-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench benchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's effectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it integrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in a resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as the "token snowball" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of "expensive failures". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on unsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also drives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a clear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness under the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets and enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are essential.</p></details> |  |

While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor executions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to configuring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual effort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or input minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a complete fuzzing campaign. We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision. Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Some languages do not provide dedicated editors, while others offer a single native editor. The $\textit{language server protocol}$ (LSP) reduces the language-editor combinations $L \times E$ to $L + E$, where a single language server communicates with editors via LSP plugins. However, overlapping implementations of linguistic components remain an issue. Existing language workbenches struggle with modularity, reusability, and leveraging type systems for language server generation. In this work, we propose: (i) Typelang, a family of domain-specific languages for modular, composable, and reusable type system implementation, (ii) a modular language server generation process, producing servers for languages built in a modular workbench, (iii) the variant-oriented programming paradigm and a cross-artifact coordination layer to manage interdependent software variants, and (iv) an LSP plugin generator, reducing $E$ to $1$ by automating plugin creation for multiple editors. To simplify editing support for language families, each language artifact integrates its own Typelang variant, used to generate language servers. This reduces combinations to $T \times 1$, where $T = L$ represents the number of type systems. Further reuse of language artifacts across languages lowers this to $N \times 1$, where $N << T$, representing unique type systems. We implement Typelang in Neverlang, generating language servers for each artifact and LSP plugins for three editors. Empirical evaluation shows a 93.48% reduction in characters needed for type system implementation and 100% automation of LSP plugin generation, significantly lowering effort for editing support in language families, especially when artifacts are reused.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, Journal of Systems and Software, June 2025, for the replication package, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15276991</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI-assisted programming scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks. Moreover, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state of AI code generation and help developers identify the most suitable models for practical tasks. They also lay the groundwork for refining LLMs to generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Building on the original Framework for AI-driven Code Generation Evaluation (FACE), the authors retrofit the pipeline to work entirely offline through the Ollama runtime, collapsing FACE's sprawling per-problem directory tree into a handful of consolidated JSON files, and adding robust checkpointing so multi-day runs can resume after failures. The enhanced framework generates, submits, and records solutions for the full Kattis corpus of 3,589 problems across eight code-oriented models ranging from 6.7-9 billion parameters. The submission results show that the overall pass@1 accuracy is modest for the local models, with the best models performing at approximately half the acceptance rate of the proprietary models, Gemini 1.5 and ChatGPT-4. These findings expose a persistent gap between private, cost-controlled LLM deployments and state-of-the-art proprietary services, yet also highlight the rapid progress of open models and the practical benefits of an evaluation workflow that organizations can replicate on in-house hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables, accepted to CCSC Eastern 2025</p></details> |

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2025.

Originally pioneered by Netflix, CE simulates real-world failures to expose weaknesses before they impact production. In this paper, we present a systematic gray literature review that investigates how industry practitioners have adopted and adapted CE principles over recent years. Analyzing 50 sources published between 2019 and early 2024, we developed a comprehensive classification framework that extends the foundational CE principles into ten distinct concepts. Our study reveals that while the core tenets of CE remain influential, practitioners increasingly emphasize controlled experimentation, automation, and risk mitigation strategies to align with the demands of agile and continuously evolving DevOps pipelines. Our results enhance the understanding of how CE is intended and implemented in practice, and offer guidance for future research and industrial applications aimed at improving system robustness in dynamic production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025</p></details> |

We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around \$100,000 (manual annotation) to just \$5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).</p></details> | <details><summary>*Firs...</summary><p>*First three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

We introduce CARGO (Category-Aware Routing with Gap-based Optimization), a lightweight, confidence-aware framework for dynamic LLM selection. CARGO employs a single embedding-based regressor trained on LLM-judged pairwise comparisons to predict model performance, with an optional binary classifier invoked when predictions are uncertain. This two-stage design enables precise, cost-aware routing without the need for human-annotated supervision. To capture domain-specific behavior, CARGO also supports category-specific regressors trained across five task groups: mathematics, coding, reasoning, summarization, and creative writing. Evaluated on four competitive LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek V3, and Perplexity Sonar), CARGO achieves a top-1 routing accuracy of 76.4% and win rates ranging from 72% to 89% against individual experts. These results demonstrate that confidence-guided, lightweight routing can achieve expert-level performance with minimal overhead, offering a practical solution for real-world, multi-model LLM deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v5)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |

A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025-findings https://openreview.net/forum?id=d4ICISW2T4</p></details> |

This fails to reflect the holistic context-rich nature of real-world CR. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeFuse-CR-Bench, the first comprehensiveness-aware benchmark for repository-level CR evaluation. CodeFuse-CR-Bench comprises 601 high-quality instances from 70 Python projects covering nine Pull-Request (PR) problem domains, where each instance provides rich, multi-faceted context including the associated issue, PR details, and repository state, enabling end-to-end evaluation. Beyond superficial metrics, we also propose a novel evaluation framework that combines rule-based checks for location and syntax with model-based judgments of review quality. We present the first large-scale assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on this comprehensive CR task. Our results establish crucial baselines and reveal that (1) no single LLM dominates all aspects of CR; (2) Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest comprehensive performance; and (3) different LLMs exhibit varying robustness to redundant context. These findings highlight the necessity of holistic, multi-dimensional evaluation and provide actionable insights for advancing truly intelligent yet practical CR assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

The ability to generate code and submit pull requests with minimal human intervention, through the use of autonomous AI agents, is poised to become a standard practice. However, little is known about the practical usefulness of these pull requests and the extent to which their contributions are accepted in real-world projects. In this paper, we empirically study 567 GitHub pull requests (PRs) generated using Claude Code, an agentic coding tool, across 157 diverse open-source projects. Our analysis reveals that developers tend to rely on agents for tasks such as refactoring, documentation, and testing. The results indicate that 83.8% of these agent-assisted PRs are eventually accepted and merged by project maintainers, with 54.9% of the merged PRs are integrated without further modification. The remaining 45.1% require additional changes benefit from human revisions, especially for bug fixes, documentation, and adherence to project-specific standards. These findings suggest that while agent-assisted PRs are largely acceptable, they still benefit from human oversight and refinement.</p></details> |  |

Key to this process are agent manifests, configuration files (such as Claude.md) that provide agents with essential project context, identity, and operational rules. However, the lack of comprehensive and accessible documentation for creating these manifests presents a significant challenge for developers. We analyzed 253 Claude.md files from 242 repositories to identify structural patterns and common content. Our findings show that manifests typically have shallow hierarchies with one main heading and several subsections, with content dominated by operational commands, technical implementation notes, and high-level architecture.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files. This limitation significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics from assembly code. To address this limitation, we propose \saltm, a novel binary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared between binary and source code. The core idea of \saltm is to abstract selected binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery. Given a binary function, \saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree (\salt) from assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language. It then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed \salt to generate decompiled code. Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol recovery to improve readability and correctness. We compare \saltm to three categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercial decompilers, and decompilation methods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP, Exebench). Our experimental results demonstrate that \saltm is highly effective in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with a 10.6\% improvement). The results further validate its robustness against four commonly used obfuscation techniques. Additionally, analyses of real-world software and a user study confirm that our decompiled output offers superior assistance to human analysts in comprehending binary functions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

While existing benchmarks such as CoSQA and CodeQA have advanced the field, they predominantly focus on small, self-contained code snippets. These setups fail to capture the complexity of real-world repositories, where effective understanding and reasoning often require navigating multiple files, understanding software architecture, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. In this paper, we present SWE-QA, a repository-level code question answering (QA) benchmark designed to facilitate research on automated QA systems in realistic code environments. SWE-QA involves 576 high-quality question-answer pairs spanning diverse categories, including intention understanding, cross-file reasoning, and multi-hop dependency analysis. To construct SWE-QA, we first crawled 77,100 GitHub issues from 11 popular repositories. Based on an analysis of naturally occurring developer questions extracted from these issues, we developed a two-level taxonomy of repository-level questions and constructed a set of seed questions for each category. For each category, we manually curated and validated questions and collected their corresponding answers. As a prototype application, we further develop SWE-QA-Agent, an agentic framework in which LLM agents reason and act to find answers automatically. We evaluate six advanced LLMs on SWE-QA under various context augmentation strategies. Experimental results highlight the promise of LLMs, particularly our SWE-QA-Agent framework, in addressing repository-level QA, while also revealing open challenges and pointing to future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/peng-weihan/SWE-QA-Bench</p></details> |

Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Limitations of Embedding Based Methods for Measuring Functional Correctness for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01580v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of code generation from natural language (NL2Code) has become extremely popular, especially with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly 3.9$\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\times$ other baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MatchFixAgent: Language-Agnostic Autonomous Repository-Level Code Translation Validation and Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16187v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms source code from one programming language (PL) to another. Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |

Recent strides in Code Large Language Models (code LLMs) have spurred the development of repository-level code completion methods, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, they suffer from issues such as inappropriate query construction, single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code LLM. To address these problems, we introduce CodeRAG, a framework tailored to identify relevant and necessary knowledge for retrieval-augmented repository-level code completion.

These sophisticated software applications are not built from the ground up, instead they rely on smaller parts for specific use cases, usually from domains unfamiliar to the application scientists. The software library Ginkgo is one of these building blocks to handle sparse numerical linear algebra on different platforms. By using Ginkgo, applications are able to ease the transition to modern systems, and speed up their simulations through faster numerical linear algebra routines.

It will present examples from different domains, such as CFD, power grid simulation, as well as electro-cardiophysiology. For these cases, the impact of the integrations on the application code is discussed from a software engineering standpoint, and in particular, the approaches taken by Ginkgo and the applications to enable sustainable software development are highlighted.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

This study aims to assist Machine Learning (ML) engineers in enhancing their code by identifying and correcting Data Leakage issues within their models. Data Leakage occurs when information from the test dataset is inadvertently included in the training data when preparing a data science model, resulting in misleading performance evaluations. ML developers must carefully separate their data into training, evaluation, and test sets to avoid introducing Data Leakage into their code. In this paper, we develop a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension, called LeakageDetector, that detects Data Leakage, mainly Overlap, Preprocessing and Multi-test leakage, from Jupyter Notebook files. Beyond detection, we included two correction mechanisms: a conventional approach, known as a quick fix, which manually fixes the leakage, and an LLM-driven approach that guides ML developers toward best practices for building ML pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Yet this code is unsuitable for formal verification due to side effects, mutable state, concurrency, and legacy design. A standalone formal specification would enable verification both across versions of the reference client and against new client implementations, strengthening decentralization by reducing the risk of consensus-splitting bugs. Yet such a specification has long been considered intractable given the complexity of Bitcoin's consensus logic. We demonstrate a compact, executable, declarative C++ specification of Bitcoin consensus rules that syncs mainnet to tip in a few hours on a single thread. We also introduce the Hornet Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to encode these rules unambiguously for execution, enabling formal reasoning, consensus code generation, and AI-driven adversarial testing. Our spec-driven client Hornet Node offers a modern and modular complement to the reference client. Its clear, idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns, supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to token selection during decoding, particularly at decision points where uncertainty strongly affects program correctness. Conventional strategies such as greedy decoding treat all tokens uniformly and fail to capture the uncertainty characteristics unique to code, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis and show that a large fraction of generation errors arises from token misranking at high-uncertainty positions, where the correct token is available but not prioritized. To address this, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework that employs a lookahead-based, uncertainty-aware pause-and-rerank mechanism. AdaDec automatically learns model-specific uncertainty thresholds and selectively invokes reranking when high uncertainty is detected, leveraging lookahead to refine token choice. Across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and DevEval benchmarks, AdaDec yields substantial improvements, achieving up to 20.9% absolute gains in Pass@1 accuracy compared with greedy decoding, while consistently outperforming prior adaptive decoding approaches such as AdapT. Furthermore, by applying reranking only when necessary, AdaDec reduces computational overhead and latency, enhancing efficiency alongside reliability. These findings underscore the value of uncertainty-guided decoding strategies in advancing the robustness and practicality of LLM-based code generation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

They effectively help developers understand code changes and better perform software maintenance tasks. Unfortunately, developers often neglect to write high-quality commit messages in practice. Therefore, a growing body of work is proposed to generate commit messages automatically. These works all demonstrated that how to organize and represent code changes is vital in generating good commit messages, including the use of fine-grained graphs or embeddings to better represent code changes. In this study, we choose an alternative way to condense code changes before generation, i.e., proposing brief yet concise text templates consisting of the following three parts: (1) summarized code changes, (2) elicited comments, and (3) emphasized code identifiers. Specifically, we first condense code changes by using our proposed templates with the help of a heuristic-based tool named ChangeScribe, and then fine-tune CodeLlama-7B on the pairs of our proposed templates and corresponding commit messages. Our proposed templates better utilize pre-trained language models, while being naturally brief and readable to complement generated commit messages for developers. Our evaluation based on a widely used dataset showed that our approach can outperform six baselines in terms of BLEU-Norm, METEOR, and ROUGE-L, with average improvements of 51.7%, 78.7%, and 62.5%, respectively. The ablation study and human evaluation also provide further insights into the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MigGPT: Harnessing Large Language Models for Automated Migration of Out-of-Tree Linux Kernel Patches Across Versions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09474v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-tree kernel patches are essential for adapting the Linux kernel to new hardware or enabling specific functionalities. Maintaining and updating these patches across different kernel versions demands significant effort from experienced engineers. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across various domains, suggesting their potential for automating out-of-tree kernel patch migration. However, our findings reveal that LLMs, while promising, struggle with incomplete code context understanding and inaccurate migration point identification. In this work, we propose MigGPT, a framework that employs a novel code fingerprint structure to retain code snippet information and incorporates three meticulously designed modules to improve the migration accuracy and efficiency of out-of-tree kernel patches. Furthermore, we establish a robust benchmark using real-world out-of-tree kernel patch projects to evaluate LLM capabilities. Evaluations show that MigGPT significantly outperforms the direct application of vanilla LLMs, achieving an average completion rate of 74.07 for migration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoCaL: Countering Surface Bias in Code Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15397v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, reliable and effective code evaluation metrics (CEMs) have become crucial for progress across several software engineering tasks. While popular benchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated code, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs provide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its functional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on reporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness, the causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this work, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs, revealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code functionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these CEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally dissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this gap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117 code pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a functional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to perform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through differential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and, at the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order of magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show significant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines. Finally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to LoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to surface bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Effi: Re-Evaluating Software AI Agent System Effectiveness Under Resource Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09853v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and code agents has demonstrated significant potential to assist software engineering (SWE) tasks, such as autonomous issue resolution and feature addition. Existing AI for software engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution accuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a resource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond software engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must also be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of new metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness scores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome (e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time). In this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by re-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench benchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's effectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it integrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in a resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as the "token snowball" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of "expensive failures". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on unsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also drives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a clear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness under the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets and enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orion: Fuzzing Workflow Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15195v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzz testing is one of the most effective techniques for finding software vulnerabilities. While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor executions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to configuring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual effort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or input minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a complete fuzzing campaign. We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision. Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Some languages do not provide dedicated editors, while others offer a single native editor. The $\textit{language server protocol}$ (LSP) reduces the language-editor combinations $L \times E$ to $L + E$, where a single language server communicates with editors via LSP plugins. However, overlapping implementations of linguistic components remain an issue. Existing language workbenches struggle with modularity, reusability, and leveraging type systems for language server generation. In this work, we propose: (i) Typelang, a family of domain-specific languages for modular, composable, and reusable type system implementation, (ii) a modular language server generation process, producing servers for languages built in a modular workbench, (iii) the variant-oriented programming paradigm and a cross-artifact coordination layer to manage interdependent software variants, and (iv) an LSP plugin generator, reducing $E$ to $1$ by automating plugin creation for multiple editors. To simplify editing support for language families, each language artifact integrates its own Typelang variant, used to generate language servers. This reduces combinations to $T \times 1$, where $T = L$ represents the number of type systems. Further reuse of language artifacts across languages lowers this to $N \times 1$, where $N << T$, representing unique type systems. We implement Typelang in Neverlang, generating language servers for each artifact and LSP plugins for three editors. Empirical evaluation shows a 93.48% reduction in characters needed for type system implementation and 100% automation of LSP plugin generation, significantly lowering effort for editing support in language families, especially when artifacts are reused.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, Journal of Systems and Software, June 2025, for the replication package, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15276991</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI-assisted programming scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks. Moreover, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state of AI code generation and help developers identify the most suitable models for practical tasks. They also lay the groundwork for refining LLMs to generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Building on the original Framework for AI-driven Code Generation Evaluation (FACE), the authors retrofit the pipeline to work entirely offline through the Ollama runtime, collapsing FACE's sprawling per-problem directory tree into a handful of consolidated JSON files, and adding robust checkpointing so multi-day runs can resume after failures. The enhanced framework generates, submits, and records solutions for the full Kattis corpus of 3,589 problems across eight code-oriented models ranging from 6.7-9 billion parameters. The submission results show that the overall pass@1 accuracy is modest for the local models, with the best models performing at approximately half the acceptance rate of the proprietary models, Gemini 1.5 and ChatGPT-4. These findings expose a persistent gap between private, cost-controlled LLM deployments and state-of-the-art proprietary services, yet also highlight the rapid progress of open models and the practical benefits of an evaluation workflow that organizations can replicate on in-house hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables, accepted to CCSC Eastern 2025</p></details> |

Utilizing statistical methods such as Z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR), we identify anomalies in bug resolution durations. To understand the thematic nature of these anomalies, we apply Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for textual feature extraction and KMeans clustering to group similar bug summaries. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across projects, with anomalies often clustering around test failures, enhancement requests, and user interface issues.

While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset.

This study aims to assist Machine Learning (ML) engineers in enhancing their code by identifying and correcting Data Leakage issues within their models. Data Leakage occurs when information from the test dataset is inadvertently included in the training data when preparing a data science model, resulting in misleading performance evaluations. ML developers must carefully separate their data into training, evaluation, and test sets to avoid introducing Data Leakage into their code. In this paper, we develop a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension, called LeakageDetector, that detects Data Leakage, mainly Overlap, Preprocessing and Multi-test leakage, from Jupyter Notebook files. Beyond detection, we included two correction mechanisms: a conventional approach, known as a quick fix, which manually fixes the leakage, and an LLM-driven approach that guides ML developers toward best practices for building ML pipelines.</p></details> |  |
