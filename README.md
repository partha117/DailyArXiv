| **[Securing High-Concurrency Ticket Sales: A Framework Based on Microservice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24941v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the "add passenger" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.</p></details> |  |

Traditional regulatory technology solutions designed for centralized financial systems prove inadequate for blockchain's transparent yet pseudonymous networks. This systematization examines how blockchain-native RegTech solutions leverage distributed ledger properties to enable novel compliance capabilities. We develop three taxonomies organizing the Web3 RegTech domain: a regulatory paradigm evolution framework across ten dimensions, a compliance protocol taxonomy encompassing five verification layers, and a RegTech lifecycle framework spanning preventive, real-time, and investigative phases. Through analysis of 41 operational commercial platforms and 28 academic prototypes selected from systematic literature review (2015-2025), we demonstrate that Web3 RegTech enables transaction graph analysis, real-time risk assessment, cross-chain analytics, and privacy-preserving verification approaches that are difficult to achieve or less commonly deployed in traditional centralized systems. Our analysis reveals critical gaps between academic innovation and industry deployment, alongside persistent challenges in cross-chain tracking, DeFi interaction analysis, privacy protocol monitoring, and scalability. We synthesize architectural best practices and identify research directions addressing these gaps while respecting Web3's core principles of decentralization, transparency, and user sovereignty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Slice Matching for Precise Bug Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24858v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring the function similarity to detect bugs is effective, but the statements unrelated to the bugs can impede the performance due to the noise interference. Suppressing the noise interference in existing works does not manage the tough job, i.e., eliminating the noise in the targets. In this paper, we propose MATUS to mitigate the target noise for precise bug detection based on similarity measurement. Feature slices are extracted from both the buggy query and the targets to represent the semantic feature of (potential) bug logics. In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets. Experiments show that MATUS holds advantages in bug detection for real-world projects with acceptable efficiency. In total, MATUS has spotted 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel. All of them have been confirmed by the kernel developers, and 11 have been assigned CVEs.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE2026 |

While ChatGPT's potential has been extensively discussed, empirical evidence about how developers actually use LLMs' assistance in real-world practices remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis of ChatGPT usage on GitHub, and we presented DevChat, a curated dataset of 2,547 publicly shared ChatGPT conversation links collected from GitHub between May 2023 and June 2024. Through comprehensively analyzing DevChat, we explored the characteristics of developer-ChatGPT interaction patterns and identified five key categories of developers' purposes for sharing developer-ChatGPT conversations during software development. Additionally, we investigated the dominant development-related activities in which ChatGPT is used, and presented a mapping framework that links GitHub data sources, development-related activities, and SE tasks. The findings show that interactions are typically short and task-focused (most are 1-3 turns); developers share conversations mainly to delegate tasks, resolve problems, and acquire knowledge, revealing five purpose categories; ChatGPT is most frequently engaged for Software Implementation and Maintenance & Evolution; we identified 39 fine-grained SE tasks supported by ChatGPT, with Code Generation & Completion as well as Code modification & Optimization being the most prominent. Our study offers a comprehensive mapping of ChatGPT's applications in real-world software development scenarios and provides a foundation for understanding LLMs' practical roles in software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 11 images, 3 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the "add passenger" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.</p></details> |  |

In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the "add passenger" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.</p></details> |  |

Traditional regulatory technology solutions designed for centralized financial systems prove inadequate for blockchain's transparent yet pseudonymous networks. This systematization examines how blockchain-native RegTech solutions leverage distributed ledger properties to enable novel compliance capabilities. We develop three taxonomies organizing the Web3 RegTech domain: a regulatory paradigm evolution framework across ten dimensions, a compliance protocol taxonomy encompassing five verification layers, and a RegTech lifecycle framework spanning preventive, real-time, and investigative phases. Through analysis of 41 operational commercial platforms and 28 academic prototypes selected from systematic literature review (2015-2025), we demonstrate that Web3 RegTech enables transaction graph analysis, real-time risk assessment, cross-chain analytics, and privacy-preserving verification approaches that are difficult to achieve or less commonly deployed in traditional centralized systems. Our analysis reveals critical gaps between academic innovation and industry deployment, alongside persistent challenges in cross-chain tracking, DeFi interaction analysis, privacy protocol monitoring, and scalability. We synthesize architectural best practices and identify research directions addressing these gaps while respecting Web3's core principles of decentralization, transparency, and user sovereignty.</p></details> |  |
