| **[CI at Scale: Lean, Green, and Fast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03440v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining a "green" mainline branch, where all builds pass successfully, is crucial but challenging in fast-paced, large-scale software development environments, particularly with concurrent code changes in large monorepos. SubmitQueue, a system designed to address these challenges, speculatively executes builds and only lands changes with successful outcomes. However, despite its effectiveness, the system faces inefficiencies in resource utilization, leading to a high rate of premature build aborts and delays in landing smaller changes blocked by larger conflicting ones. This paper introduces enhancements to SubmitQueue, focusing on optimizing resource usage and improving build prioritization. Central to this is our innovative probabilistic model, which distinguishes between changes with shorter and longer build times to prioritize builds for more efficient scheduling. By leveraging a machine learning model to predict build times and incorporating this into the probabilistic framework, we expedite the landing of smaller changes blocked by conflicting larger time-consuming changes. Additionally, introducing a concept of speculation threshold ensures that only the most likely builds are executed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption. After implementing these enhancements across Uber's major monorepos (Go, iOS, and Android), we observed a reduction in Continuous Integration (CI) resource usage by approximately 53%, CPU usage by 44%, and P95 waiting times by 37%. These improvements highlight the enhanced efficiency of SubmitQueue in managing large-scale software changes while maintaining a green mainline.</p></details> |  |

These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sense and Sensitivity: Examining the Influence of Semantic Recall on Long Context Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13353v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability. Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval) and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall. Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity, potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context information.</p></details> |  |

Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on code generation and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MigrationBench with a distinct focus: code migration. MigrationBench aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java $8$ to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java $17$, $21$), including a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java $17$. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves $62.33\%$ and $27.33\%$ success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience/migrationbench-68125452fc21a4564b92b6c3 and https://github.com/amazon-science/MigrationBench respectively.</p></details> |  |

Parf models various types of external parameters (encoding abstraction strategies) as random variables subject to probability distributions over latticed parameter spaces. It incrementally refines the probability distributions based on accumulated intermediate results generated by repeatedly sampling and analyzing, thereby ultimately yielding a set of highly accurate abstraction strategies. Parf is implemented on top of Frama-C/Eva - an off-the-shelf open-source static analyzer for C programs. Parf provides a web-based user interface facilitating the intuitive configuration of static analyzers and visualization of dynamic distribution refinement of the abstraction strategies. It further supports the identification of dominant parameters in Frama-C/Eva analysis. Benchmark experiments and a case study demonstrate the competitive performance of Parf for analyzing complex, large-scale real-world programs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optimizing Retrieval Augmented Generation for Object Constraint Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13129v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is essential for defining precise constraints within Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). However, manually writing OCL rules is complex and time-consuming. This study explores the optimization of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for automating OCL rule generation, focusing on the impact of different retrieval strategies. We evaluate three retrieval approaches $\unicode{x2013}$ BM25 (lexical-based), BERT-based (semantic retrieval), and SPLADE (sparse-vector retrieval) $\unicode{x2013}$ analyzing their effectiveness in providing relevant context for a large language model. To further assess our approach, we compare and benchmark our retrieval-optimized generation results against PathOCL, a state-of-the-art graph-based method. We directly compare BM25, BERT, and SPLADE retrieval methods with PathOCL to understand how different retrieval methods perform for a unified evaluation framework. Our experimental results, focusing on retrieval-augmented generation, indicate that while retrieval can enhance generation accuracy, its effectiveness depends on the retrieval method and the number of retrieved chunks (k). BM25 underperforms the baseline, whereas semantic approaches (BERT and SPLADE) achieve better results, with SPLADE performing best at lower k values. However, excessive retrieval with high k parameter can lead to retrieving irrelevant chunks which degrades model performance. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing retrieval configurations to balance context relevance and output consistency. This research provides insights into improving OCL rule generation using RAG and underscores the need for tailoring retrieval.</p></details> |  |

| **[Evaluating Mutation-based Fault Localization for Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09059v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to execute operations. They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Better Understanding of Probabilistic Delta Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04735v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.</p></details> | accepted by ICSE25 |

This has led to the emergence of AI for Software Engineering as a distinct research area within software engineering. With the development of quantum computing, the field of Quantum AI (QAI) is arising, enhancing the performance of classical AI and holding significant potential for solving classical software engineering problems. Some initial applications of QAI in software engineering have already emerged, such as software test optimization. However, the path ahead remains open, offering ample opportunities to solve complex software engineering problems with QAI cost-effectively. To this end, this paper presents open research opportunities and challenges in QAI for software engineering that need to be addressed.</p></details> |  |

DiffMin iteratively applies edit actions to transform a fuzzed input while preserving the crash behavior. Our pilot study with the Magma benchmark demonstrates that DiffMin effectively minimizes the differences between crashing and passing inputs while enhancing the accuracy of spectrum-based fault localization, highlighting its potential as a valuable pre-debugging step after greybox fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be presented in the Posters track at FSE 2025 (https://conf.researchr.org/track/fse-2025/fse-2025-posters)</p></details> |
| **[On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02274v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing LLM Code Generation: A Systematic Evaluation of Multi-Agent Collaboration and Runtime Debugging for Improved Accuracy, Reliability, and Latency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02133v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models (LLMs) for automated code generation has emerged as a significant focus within AI research. As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |
| **[Towards Source Mapping for Zero-Knowledge Smart Contracts: Design and Preliminary Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04322v4)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and auditing zero-knowledge-compatible smart contracts remains a significant challenge due to the lack of source mapping in compilers such as zkSolc. In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLPut: Investigating Large Language Models for Bug Report-Based Input Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20578v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failure-inducing inputs play a crucial role in diagnosing and analyzing software bugs. Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025)</p></details> |
| **[RocketPPA: Ultra-Fast LLM-Based PPA Estimator at Code-Level Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21971v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have recently transformed hardware design, yet bridging the gap between code synthesis and PPA (power, performance, and area) estimation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that leverages a 21k dataset of thoroughly cleaned and synthesizable Verilog modules, each annotated with detailed power, delay, and area metrics. By employing chain-of-thought techniques, we automatically debug and curate this dataset to ensure high fidelity in downstream applications. We then fine-tune CodeLlama using LoRA-based parameter-efficient methods, framing the task as a regression problem to accurately predict PPA metrics from Verilog code. Furthermore, we augment our approach with a mixture-of-experts architecture-integrating both LoRA and an additional MLP expert layer-to further refine predictions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: power estimation accuracy is enhanced by 5.9% at a 20% error threshold and by 7.2% at a 10% threshold, delay estimation improves by 5.1% and 3.9%, and area estimation sees gains of 4% and 7.9% for the 20% and 10% thresholds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of the mixture-of-experts module contributes an additional 3--4% improvement across these tasks. Our results establish a new benchmark for PPA-aware Verilog generation, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated dataset and modeling strategies for next-generation EDA workflows.</p></details> |  |

Exploring the Use of Android Record & Replay Tools in Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20237v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android User Interface (UI) testing is a critical research area due to the ubiquity of apps and the challenges faced by developers. Record and replay (R&R) tools facilitate manual and automated UI testing by recording UI actions to execute test scenarios and replay bugs. These tools typically support (i) regression testing, (ii) non-crashing functional bug reproduction, and (iii) crashing bug reproduction. However, prior work only examines these tools in fragmented settings, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across common use cases. We address this gap by conducting an empirical study on using R&R tools to record and replay non-crashing failures, crashing bugs, and feature-based user scenarios, and explore combining R&R with automated input generation (AIG) tools to replay crashing bugs. Our study involves one industrial and three academic R&R tools, 34 scenarios from 17 apps, 90 non-crashing failures from 42 apps, and 31 crashing bugs from 17 apps. Results show that 17% of scenarios, 38% of non-crashing bugs, and 44% of crashing bugs cannot be reliably recorded and replayed, mainly due to action interval resolution, API incompatibility, and Android tooling limitations. Our findings highlight key future research directions to enhance the practical application of R&R tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MobileSoft 2025</p></details> |

Put some Whamm on it!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20192v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and monitoring programs are integral to engineering and deploying software. Dynamic analyses monitor applications through source code or IR injection, machine code or bytecode rewriting, and virtual machine or direct hardware support. While these techniques are viable within their respective domains, common tooling across techniques is rare, leading to fragmentation of skills, duplicated efforts, and inconsistent feature support. We address this problem in the WebAssembly ecosystem with Whamm, a declarative instrumentation DSL for WebAssembly that abstracts above the instrumentation strategy, leveraging bytecode rewriting and engine support as available. Whamm solves three problems: 1) tooling fragmentation, 2) prohibitive instrumentation overhead of general-purpose frameworks, and 3) tedium of tailoring low-level high-performance mechanisms. Whamm provides fully-programmable instrumentation with declarative match rules, static and dynamic predication, automatic state reporting, and user library support, while achieving high performance through compiler and engine optimizations. At the back end, Whamm provides instrumentation to a Wasm engine as Wasm code, reusing existing engine optimizations and unlocking new ones, most notably intrinsification, to minimize overhead. In particular, explicitly requesting program state in match rules, rather than reflection, enables the engine to efficiently bundle arguments and even inline compiled probe logic. Whamm streamlines the tooling effort, as its bytecode-rewriting target can run instrumented programs everywhere, lowering fragmentation and advancing the state of the art for engine support. We evaluate Whamm with case studies of non-trivial monitors and show it is expressive, powerful, and efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoP2C: An LLM-Based Agent Framework for Code Repository Generation from Multimodal Content in Academic Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20115v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML) research is spread through academic papers featuring rich multimodal content, including text, diagrams, and tabular results. However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

| **[VeriDebug: A Unified LLM for Verilog Debugging via Contrastive Embedding and Guided Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19099v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in debugging for various programming languages. However, the application of LLMs to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging. Unlike existing methods, VeriDebug employs an embedding-based technique to accurately retrieve internal information, followed by bug-fixing. VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves 64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo (36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of various large language models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA, GEMINI, and GPT-4o in interpreting such visual inputs. We employ prompt engineering techniques, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot learning, to assess each model's responsiveness and accuracy. Our findings show that while GPT-4o shows promising capabilities, achieving over 60% similarity to baseline questions for 51.75% of the tested images, challenges remain in obtaining consistent and accurate interpretations for more complex images. This research advances our understanding of the feasibility of using generative AI for image-centric problem-solving in developer communities, highlighting both the potential benefits and current limitations of this approach while envisioning a future where visual-based debugging copilot tools become a reality.</p></details> |  |

Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability, especially their error rates across domains and the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o). Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025. Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error distributions. Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50% with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%. Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over 50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates (~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability (10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability. Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from biological healing - where the human body detects damage, signals the brain, and activates targeted recovery - this paper explores the concept of self-healing software driven by artificial intelligence. We propose a novel framework that mimics this biological model system observability tools serve as sensory inputs, AI models function as the cognitive core for diagnosis and repair, and healing agents apply targeted code and test modifications. By combining log analysis, static code inspection, and AI-driven generation of patches or test updates, our approach aims to reduce downtime, accelerate debugging, and enhance software resilience. We evaluate the effectiveness of this model through case studies and simulations, comparing it against traditional manual debugging and recovery workflows. This work paves the way toward intelligent, adaptive and self-reliant software systems capable of continuous healing, akin to living organisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Interactive Debugger for Rust Trait Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18704v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiler diagnostics for type inference failures are notoriously bad, and type classes only make the problem worse. By introducing a complex search process during inference, type classes can lead to wholly inscrutable or useless errors. We describe a system, Argus, for interactively visualizing type class inferences to help programmers debug inference failures, applied specifically to Rust's trait system. The core insight of Argus is to avoid the traditional model of compiler diagnostics as one-size-fits-all, instead providing the programmer with different views on the search tree corresponding to different debugging goals. Argus carefully uses defaults to improve debugging productivity, including interface design (e.g., not showing full paths of types by default) and heuristics (e.g., sorting obligations based on the expected complexity of fixing them). We evaluated Argus in a user study where $N = 25$ participants debugged type inference failures in realistic Rust programs, finding that participants using Argus correctly localized $2.2\times$ as many faults and localized $3.3\times$ faster compared to not using Argus.</p></details> |  |

These missing links and data obstruct both developers and, more recently, large language models (LLMs) working with unfamiliar code. We present Codetations, a system that helps developers contextualize documents with rich notes and tools. Unlike previous approaches, notes in Codetations stay outside the document to prevent code clutter, attaching to spans in the document using a hybrid edit-tracking/LLM-based method. Their content is dynamic, interactive, and synchronized with code changes. A worked example shows that relevant notes with interactively-collected data improve LLM performance during code repair. In our user evaluation, developers praised these properties and saw significant potential in annotation types that we generated with an LLM in just a few minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Adaptive Software Agents for Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18316v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using multiple agents was found to improve the debugging capabilities of Large Language Models. However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design, where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix, we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct their software goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, FSE2025</p></details> |

Diffing Build Logs with CiDiff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18182v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous integration (CI) is widely used by developers to ensure the quality and reliability of their software projects. However, diagnosing a CI regression is a tedious process that involves the manual analysis of lengthy build logs. In this paper, we explore how textual differencing can support the debugging of CI regressions. As off-the-shelf diff algorithms produce suboptimal results, in this work we introduce a new diff algorithm specifically tailored to build logs called CiDiff. We evaluate CiDiff against several baselines on a novel dataset of 17 906 CI regressions, performing an accuracy study, a quantitative study and a user-study. Notably, our algorithm reduces the number of lines to inspect by about 60 % in the median case, with reasonable overhead compared to the state-of-practice LCS-diff. Finally, our algorithm is preferred by the majority of participants in 70 % of the regression cases, whereas LCS-diff is preferred in only 5 % of the cases.</p></details> |  |

(2) Showcases modern features, including per-app address spaces, threading, commodity filesystems, USB, DMA, multicore, self-hosted debugging, and a window manager. (3) Supports rich applications such as 2D/3D games, music and video players, and a blockchain miner. Unlike traditional instructional systems, VOS emphasizes strong motivation for building systems-supporting engaging, media-rich apps that go beyond basic terminal programs. To achieve this, we design VOS to strike a careful balance between essential OS complexity and overall simplicity. Our method, which we call inverse engineering, breaks down a full-featured OS into a set of incremental, self-contained prototypes. Each prototype introduces a minimal set of OS mechanisms, driven by the needs of specific apps. The construction process (i.e., forward engineering) then progressively enables these apps by bringing up one mechanism at a time. VOS makes it accessible for a wider audience to experience building a software system that is self-contained and usable in everyday scenarios.</p></details> |  |

General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2025 AI4EDU Workshop</p></details> |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, to appear at FSE 2025</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up industrial survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 17 images, 8 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, the lack of high-quality, scalable training datasets, especially those with verifiable outputs and intermediate reasoning traces-limits progress, particularly for open-source models. In this work, we present SWE-Synth, a framework for synthesizing realistic, verifiable, and process-aware bug-fix datasets at the repository level. SWE-Synth leverages LLM agents to simulate debugging workflows, producing not only bug-fix pairs but also test cases and structured repair trajectories. Compared to manually curated datasets, our method scales with minimal human effort while preserving contextual richness and correctness. Experiments show that models trained on SWE-Synth outperform those trained on real-world datasets by 2.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic, agent-generated data to advance the state of the art in APR and software engineering automation.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the complexity inherent to AI poses new challenges. Explainable AI (XAI) may allow developers to understand better the systems they build, which, in turn, can help with tasks like debugging. In this paper, we report insights from a series of surveys with software developers that highlight that there is indeed an increased need for explanatory tools to support developers in creating AI systems. However, the feedback also indicates that existing XAI systems still fall short of this aspiration. Thus, we see an unmet need to provide developers with adequate support mechanisms to cope with this complexity so they can embed AI into high-quality software in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Engineering Interactive Systems Embedding AI Technologies at EICS 2024, Tuesday June 25th, 2024 - Cagliary, Sardinia, Italy</p></details> |

It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools implement the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose ChaosEater, a system for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines the agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for Kubernetes systems, which are managed through code (i.e., Infrastructure as Code). Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater perform software engineering tasks to complete CE cycles, including requirement definition, code generation, debugging, and testing. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on both small and large Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it stably completes reasonable single CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. The CE cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>114 p...</summary><p>114 pages (7 main), 11 figures.

| **[Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15756v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p></details> |  |

In addition, it also serves as the cornerstone of the final sign-off, determining whether the chip is ready to be sent to the semiconductor foundry for fabrication. Recently, as the technology advance relentlessly, smaller metal pitches and the increasing number of devices have led to greater challenges and longer turn-around-time for experienced human designers to debug timing issues from the Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) timing reports. As a result, an efficient and intelligent methodology is highly necessary and essential for debugging timing issues and reduce the turnaround times. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise across various tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, incorporating reasoning and actions. In this work, we propose a timing analysis agent, that is empowered by multi-LLMs task solving, and incorporates a novel hierarchical planning and solving flow to automate the analysis of timing reports from commercial tool. In addition, we build a Timing Debug Relation Graph (TDRG) that connects the reports with the relationships of debug traces from experienced timing engineers. The timing analysis agent employs the novel Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, that includes agent and coding to retrieve data accurately, on the developed TDRG. In our studies, the proposed timing analysis agent achieves an average 98% pass-rate on a single-report benchmark and a 90% pass-rate for multi-report benchmark from industrial designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent That Debugs: Dynamic State-Guided Vulnerability Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07634v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, more vulnerabilities have been discovered every day, while manual vulnerability repair requires specialized knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, many detected or even published vulnerabilities remain unpatched, thereby increasing the exposure of software systems to attacks. Recent advancements in agents based on Large Language Models have demonstrated their increasing capabilities in code understanding and generation, which can be promising to achieve automated vulnerability repair. However, the effectiveness of agents based on static information retrieval is still not sufficient for patch generation. To address the challenge, we propose a program repair agent called VulDebugger that fully utilizes both static and dynamic context, and it debugs programs in a manner akin to humans. The agent inspects the actual state of the program via the debugger and infers expected states via constraints that need to be satisfied. By continuously comparing the actual state with the expected state, it deeply understands the root causes of the vulnerabilities and ultimately accomplishes repairs. We experimentally evaluated VulDebugger on 50 real-life projects. With 60.00% successfully fixed, VulDebugger significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for vulnerability repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Accurately Do Large Language Models Understand Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04372v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric. Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 600,010 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs. We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 78% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently Under Review.

We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Automated Refactoring for Efficient Migration of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support responsiveness w.r.t. ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations to make code amenable to safe, accurate, and efficient graph execution. We present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in specifying whether their otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL code could be reliably and efficiently executed as graphs while preserving semantics. The approach, based on a novel imperative tensor analysis, automatically determines when it is safe and potentially advantageous to migrate imperative DL code to graph execution. The approach is implemented as a PyDev Eclipse IDE plug-in that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and evaluated on 19 Python projects consisting of 132.05 KLOC. We found that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Studying the Impact of Early Test Termination Due to Assertion Failure on Code Coverage and Spectrum-based Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04557v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An assertion is commonly used to validate the expected programs behavior (e.g., if the returned value of a method equals an expected value) in software testing. Although it is a recommended practice to use only one assertion in a single test to avoid code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette), it is common to have multiple assertions in a single test. One issue with tests that have multiple assertions is that when the test fails at an early assertion (not the last one), the test will terminate at that point, and the remaining testing code will not be executed. This, in turn, can potentially reduce the code coverage and the performance of techniques that rely on code coverage information (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization). We refer to such a scenario as early test termination. Understanding the impact of early test termination on test coverage is important for software testing and debugging, particularly for the techniques that rely on coverage information obtained from the testing. We conducted the first empirical study on early test termination due to assertion failure (i.e., early test termination) by investigating 207 versions of 6 open-source projects. We found that a nonnegligible portion of the failed tests (19.1%) is early terminated due to assertion failure. Our findings indicate that early test termination harms both code coverage and the effectiveness of spectrum-based fault localization. For instance, after eliminating early test termination, the line/branch coverage is improved in 55% of the studied versions, and improves the performance of two popular SBFL techniques Ochiai and Tarantula by 15.1% and 10.7% compared to the original setting (without eliminating early test termination) in terms of MFR, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaCoder: An Adaptive Planning and Multi-Agent Framework for Function-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04220v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, researchers have proposed many multi-agent frameworks for function-level code generation, which aim to improve software development productivity by automatically generating function-level source code based on task descriptions. A typical multi-agent framework consists of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that are responsible for task planning, code generation, testing, debugging, etc. Studies have shown that existing multi-agent code generation frameworks perform well on ChatGPT. However, their generalizability across other foundation LLMs remains unexplored systematically. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the generalizability of four state-of-the-art multi-agent code generation frameworks across six open-source LLMs with varying parameter sizes, architectures, and performance levels. Our study reveals the unstable generalizability of existing frameworks on diverse foundation LLMs. Based on the findings obtained from the empirical study, we propose AdaCoder, a novel adaptive planning, multi-agent framework for function-level code generation. AdaCoder has two phases. Phase-1 is an initial code generation step without planning, which uses an LLM-based coding agent and a script-based testing agent to unleash LLM's native power, identify cases beyond LLM's power, and determine the errors hindering execution. Phase-2 adds a rule-based debugging agent and an LLM-based planning agent for iterative code generation with planning. Our evaluation shows that AdaCoder achieves higher generalizability on diverse LLMs. Compared to the best baseline MapCoder, AdaCoder is on average 27.69% higher in Pass@1, 16 times faster in inference, and 12 times lower in token consumption.</p></details> |  |

However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Productively Deploying Emerging Models on Emerging Platforms: A Top-Down Approach for Testing and Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09151v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While existing machine learning (ML) frameworks focus on established platforms, like running CUDA on server-grade GPUs, there have been growing demands to enable emerging AI applications in a broader set of scenarios, such as running Large Language Models (LLMs) within browsers and mobile phones. However, deploying emerging models on new platforms (such as Metal and WebGPU) presents significant software engineering challenges due to rapid model evolution and limited tooling and practices for these platforms. Previous practice for ML model deployment often follows a bottom-up fashion, where engineers first implement individual required operators and then put them together. However, this traditional development approach fails to meet the productivity requirements when deploying emerging ML applications, with the testing and debugging part as a bottleneck. To this end, we introduce \textsc{TapML}, a top-down approach designed to streamline model deployment on diverse platforms. While the traditional bottom-up approach requires crafting manual tests, \textsc{TapML} automatically creates high-quality, realistic test data through operator-wise test carving. Furthermore, \textsc{TapML} uses a migration-based strategy to gradually offload model implementation from the mature source platform to the target platform, minimizing the debugging scope of compound errors. \textsc{TapML} has been used as the default development method in the MLC-LLM project to deploy emerging ML models. Within 2 years, \textsc{TapML} has accelerated the deployment of 105 emerging models in 27 model architectures across 5 emerging platforms. We show that \textsc{TapML} effectively boosts developer productivity while ensuring the quality of deployed models. Furthermore, we summarize comprehensive case studies from our real-world development, offering best practices for developing emerging ML systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartFL: Semantics Based Probabilistic Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23224v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing-based fault localization has been a research focus in software engineering in the past decades. It localizes faulty program elements based on a set of passing and failing test executions. Since whether a fault could be triggered and detected by a test is related to program semantics, it is crucial to model program semantics in fault localization approaches. Existing approaches either consider the full semantics of the program (e.g., mutation-based fault localization and angelic debugging), leading to scalability issues, or ignore the semantics of the program (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization), leading to imprecise localization results. Our key idea is: by modeling only the correctness of program values but not their full semantics, a balance could be reached between effectiveness and scalability. To realize this idea, we introduce a probabilistic model by efficient approximation of program semantics and several techniques to address scalability challenges. Our approach, SmartFL(SeMantics bAsed pRobabilisTic Fault Localization), is evaluated on a real-world dataset, Defects4J 2.0. The top-1 statement-level accuracy of our approach is {14\%}, which improves 130\% over the best SBFL and MBFL methods. The average time cost is {205} seconds per fault, which is half of SBFL methods. After combining our approach with existing approaches using the CombineFL framework, the performance of the combined approach is significantly boosted by an average of 10\% on top-1, top-3, and top-5 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art combination methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering Code: https://github.com/toledosakasa/SMARTFL This update corrects the author's name</p></details> |

This paper explores the capabilities and applications of Llama-driven code generation, highlighting its ability to translate natural language prompts into executable code across multiple programming languages. Key features include contextual awareness, multi-language support, and enhanced debugging and optimization functionalities. By examining these aspects, we illustrate how Llama can serve as a versatile tool for developers of all skill levels, improving productivity and efficiency in software development. The potential implications for education, industry, and the future of coding practices are also discussed, underscoring the transformative impact of AI in programming. Experimentation shows that while Llama 3.1 405B performs well with simple algorithmic and data structure based problems, it still struggles with problems on Quantum Computing, Bioinformatics, and Artificial Intelligence.</p></details> | updated version |
| **[Are Autonomous Web Agents Good Testers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01495v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in automated testing, manual testing remains prevalent due to the high maintenance demands associated with test script fragility-scripts often break with minor changes in application structure. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential alternative by powering Autonomous Web Agents (AWAs) that can autonomously interact with applications. These agents may serve as Autonomous Test Agents (ATAs), potentially reducing the need for maintenance-heavy automated scripts by utilising natural language instructions similar to those used by human testers. This paper investigates the feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and how to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web applications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and failing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and pinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps, verifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using our benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed to a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best performing implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation, SeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA implementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement). However, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a promising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be addressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for robust, low maintenance test automation.

We posit that LLMs can benefit from the ability to interactively explore a codebase to gather the information relevant to their task. To achieve this, we present a textual environment, namely debug-gym, for developing LLM-based agents in an interactive coding setting. Our environment is lightweight and provides a preset of useful tools, such as a Python debugger (pdb), designed to facilitate an LLM-based agent's interactive debugging. Beyond coding and debugging tasks, this approach can be generalized to other tasks that would benefit from information-seeking behavior by an LLM agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Code Translation in Repository Context via Triple Knowledge-Augmented](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18305v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have behaved well in function-level code translation without repository-level context. However, the performance of LLMs in repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex dependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans, which leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation quality under repository context in real-world software development. First, K-Trans constructs a translation knowledge base by extracting relevant information from target-language codebases, the repository being translated, and prior translation results. Second, for each function to be translated, K-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code samples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs, serving as references to enhance LLM for translation. Third, K-Trans constructs a knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge and employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository context. It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation correctness. The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline adapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and 0.138 in CodeBLEU. It is important to note that the results also demonstrate that each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in handling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage examples making the most notable contribution. Moreover, as the self-evolution process progresses, the knowledge base continuously enhances the LLM's performance across various aspects of the repository-level code translation.</p></details> |  |

Given the English description of a programming problem and a set of unit tests, the model's goal is to synthesize the correct program that solves the problem and passes the tests. QualityFlow includes large language model (LLM) agents resembling a software development team, including code generation, testing, and self-debugging. We propose the LLM Quality Checker, which explicitly "imagines" whether the synthesized programs' execution would conform to the unit tests. The Quality Checks dynamically control the workflow, including actions to submit the final answer, clarify the problem statement, and revert previous workflow steps. Our experiments show that the Quality Checker can precisely accept any correct program, mitigate faulty synthesized tests, and prevent potential workflow deviation. QualityFlow establishes the state-of-the-art results on four program synthesis benchmarks: MBPP, HumanEval, and stricter evaluations from MBPP-EvalPlus and HumanEval-EvalPlus.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore multi-modal Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to automatically interpret the opaque representation space of vision models using natural language. This in turn, enables a semantic analysis of model behavior using human-understandable concepts, without requiring costly human annotations. Key to our approach is the notion of semantic heatmap, that succinctly captures the statistical properties of DNNs in terms of the concepts discovered with the VLM and that are computed off-line using a held-out data set. We show the utility of semantic heatmaps for fault localization -- an essential step in debugging -- in vision models. Our proposed technique helps localize the fault in the network (encoder vs head) and also highlights the responsible high-level concepts, by leveraging novel differential heatmaps, which summarize the semantic differences between the correct and incorrect behaviour of the analyzed DNN. We further propose a lightweight runtime analysis to detect and filter-out defects at runtime, thus improving the reliability of the analyzed DNNs. The runtime analysis works by measuring and comparing the similarity between the heatmap computed for a new (unseen) input and the heatmaps computed a-priori for correct vs incorrect DNN behavior. We consider two types of defects: misclassifications and vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate the debugging and runtime analysis on a case study involving a complex ResNet-based classifier trained on the RIVAL10 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>CAIN ...</summary><p>CAIN 2025 (4th International Conference on AI Engineering -- Software Engineering for AI)</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Pitfalls: Understanding Why AI-driven Code Agents Fail at GitHub Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARS: Dynamic Action Re-Sampling to Enhance Coding Agent Performance by Adaptive Tree Traversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14269v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, including natural language processing, data analysis, and software development, by enabling automation. In software engineering, LLM-powered coding agents have garnered significant attention due to their potential to automate complex development tasks, assist in debugging, and enhance productivity. However, existing approaches often struggle with sub-optimal decision-making, requiring either extensive manual intervention or inefficient compute scaling strategies. To improve coding agent performance, we present Dynamic Action Re-Sampling (DARS), a novel inference time compute scaling approach for coding agents, that is faster and more effective at recovering from sub-optimal decisions compared to baselines. While traditional agents either follow linear trajectories or rely on random sampling for scaling compute, our approach DARS works by branching out a trajectory at certain key decision points by taking an alternative action given the history of the trajectory and execution feedback of the previous attempt from that point. We evaluate our approach on SWE-Bench Lite benchmark, demonstrating that this scaling strategy achieves a pass@k score of 55% with Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2. Our framework achieves a pass@1 rate of 47%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[KernelGPT: Enhanced Kernel Fuzzing via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00563v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs in operating system kernels can affect billions of devices and users all over the world. As a result, a large body of research has been focused on kernel fuzzing, i.e., automatically generating syscall (system call) sequences to detect potential kernel bugs or vulnerabilities. Kernel fuzzing aims to generate valid syscall sequences guided by syscall specifications that define both the syntax and semantics of syscalls. While there has been existing work trying to automate syscall specification generation, this remains largely manual work, and a large number of important syscalls are still uncovered. In this paper, we propose KernelGPT, the first approach to automatically synthesizing syscall specifications via Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced kernel fuzzing. Our key insight is that LLMs have seen massive kernel code, documentation, and use cases during pre-training, and thus can automatically distill the necessary information for making valid syscalls. More specifically, KernelGPT leverages an iterative approach to automatically infer the specifications, and further debug and repair them based on the validation feedback. Our results demonstrate that KernelGPT can generate more new and valid specifications and achieve higher coverage than state-of-the-art techniques. So far, by using newly generated specifications, KernelGPT has already detected 24 new unique bugs in Linux kernel, with 12 fixed and 11 assigned with CVE numbers. Moreover, a number of specifications generated by KernelGPT have already been merged into the kernel fuzzer Syzkaller, following the request from its development team.</p></details> | ASPLOS 2025 |
| **[Mutation Testing via Iterative Large Language Model-Driven Scientific Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08182v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible test code. Intuitively they generate this by imitating tests seen in their training data, rather than reasoning about execution semantics. However, such reasoning is important when applying mutation testing, where individual tests need to demonstrate differences in program behavior between a program and specific artificial defects (mutants). In this paper, we evaluate whether Scientific Debugging, which has been shown to help LLMs when debugging, can also help them to generate tests for mutants. In the resulting approach, LLMs form hypotheses about how to kill specific mutants, and then iteratively generate and refine tests until they succeed, all with detailed explanations for each step. We compare this method to three baselines: (1) directly asking the LLM to generate tests, (2) repeatedly querying the LLM when tests fail, and (3) search-based test generation with Pynguin. Our experiments evaluate these methods based on several factors, including mutation score, code coverage, success rate, and the ability to identify equivalent mutants. The results demonstrate that LLMs, although requiring higher computation cost, consistently outperform Pynguin in generating tests with better fault detection and coverage. Importantly, we observe that the iterative refinement of test cases is important for achieving high-quality test suites.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Bug Reproduction for Effective Automated Program Repair at Google](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01821v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reports often lack sufficient detail for developers to reproduce and fix the underlying defects. Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs), tests that fail when the bug is present and pass when it has been resolved, are crucial for debugging, but they are rarely included in bug reports, both in open-source and in industrial settings. Thus, automatically generating BRTs from bug reports has the potential to accelerate the debugging process and lower time to repair. This paper investigates automated BRT generation within an industry setting, specifically at Google, focusing on the challenges of a large-scale, proprietary codebase and considering real-world industry bugs extracted from Google's internal issue tracker. We adapt and evaluate a state-of-the-art BRT generation technique, LIBRO, and present our agent-based approach, BRT Agent, which makes use of a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for code editing. Our BRT Agent significantly outperforms LIBRO, achieving a 28% plausible BRT generation rate, compared to 10% by LIBRO, on 80 human-reported bugs from Google's internal issue tracker. We further investigate the practical value of generated BRTs by integrating them with an Automated Program Repair (APR) system at Google. Our results show that providing BRTs to the APR system results in 30% more bugs with plausible fixes. Additionally, we introduce Ensemble Pass Rate (EPR), a metric which leverages the generated BRTs to select the most promising fixes from all fixes generated by APR system. Our evaluation on EPR for Top-K and threshold-based fix selections demonstrates promising results and trade-offs. For example, EPR correctly selects a plausible fix from a pool of 20 candidates in 70% of cases, based on its top-1 ranking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Autonomous Programming using Iterative Multi-Agent Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07693v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) suffers from a "near-miss syndrome": the generated code closely resembles a correct solution but fails unit tests due to minor errors. We address this with a multi-agent framework called Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, and Repair (SEIDR). Effectively applying SEIDR to instruction-tuned LLMs requires determining (a) optimal prompts for LLMs, (b) what ranking algorithm selects the best programs in debugging rounds, and (c) balancing the repair of unsuccessful programs with the generation of new ones. We empirically explore these trade-offs by comparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies. We also evaluate lexicase and tournament selection to rank candidates in each generation. On Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 (PSB2), our framework outperforms both conventional use of OpenAI Codex without a repair phase and traditional genetic programming approaches. SEIDR outperforms the use of an LLM alone, solving 18 problems in C++ and 20 in Python on PSB2 at least once across experiments. To assess generalizability, we employ GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 on the PSB2 and HumanEval-X benchmarks. Although SEIDR with these models does not surpass current state-of-the-art methods on the Python benchmarks, the results on HumanEval-C++ are promising. SEIDR with Llama 3-8B achieves an average pass@100 of 84.2%. Across all SEIDR runs, 163 of 164 problems are solved at least once with GPT-3.5 in HumanEval-C++, and 162 of 164 with the smaller Llama 3-8B.

| **[Less is More: Adaptive Program Repair with Bug Localization and Preference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06510v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) is a task to automatically generate patches for the buggy code. However, most research focuses on generating correct patches while ignoring the consistency between the fixed code and the original buggy code. How to conduct adaptive bug fixing and generate patches with minimal modifications have seldom been investigated. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a novel task, namely AdaPR (Adaptive Program Repair). We then propose a two-stage approach AdaPatcher (Adaptive Patch Generator) to enhance program repair while maintaining the consistency. In the first stage, we utilize a Bug Locator with self-debug learning to accurately pinpoint bug locations. In the second stage, we train a Program Modifier to ensure consistency between the post-modified fixed code and the pre-modified buggy code. The Program Modifier is enhanced with a location-aware repair learning strategy to generate patches based on identified buggy lines, a hybrid training strategy for selective reference and an adaptive preference learning to prioritize fewer changes. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our two-stage framework for the newly proposed AdaPR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI2025 Oral</p></details> |
| **[PromptPex: Automatic Test Generation for Language Model Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05070v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being used in many applications and prompts for these models are integrated into software applications as code-like artifacts. These prompts behave much like traditional software in that they take inputs, generate outputs, and perform some specific function. However, prompts differ from traditional code in many ways and require new approaches to ensure that they are robust. For example, unlike traditional software the output of a prompt depends on the AI model that interprets it. Also, while natural language prompts are easy to modify, the impact of updates is harder to predict. New approaches to testing, debugging, and modifying prompts with respect to the model running them are required. To address some of these issues, we developed PromptPex, an LLM-based tool to automatically generate and evaluate unit tests for a given prompt. PromptPex extracts input and output specifications from a prompt and uses them to generate diverse, targeted, and valid unit tests. These tests are instrumental in identifying regressions when a prompt is changed and also serve as a tool to understand how prompts are interpreted by different models. We use PromptPex to generate tests for eight benchmark prompts and evaluate the quality of the generated tests by seeing if they can cause each of four diverse models to produce invalid output. PromptPex consistently creates tests that result in more invalid model outputs than a carefully constructed baseline LLM-based test generator. Furthermore, by extracting concrete specifications from the input prompt, PromptPex allows prompt writers to clearly understand and test specific aspects of their prompts. The source code of PromptPex is available at https://github.com/microsoft/promptpex.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs' Reshaping of People, Processes, Products, and Society in Software Development: A Comprehensive Exploration with Early Adopters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05012v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and GitHub Copilot are rapidly gaining traction in the software industry, but their full impact on software engineering remains insufficiently explored. Despite their growing adoption, there is a notable lack of formal, qualitative assessments of how LLMs are applied in real-world software development contexts. To fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with sixteen early-adopter professional developers to explore their use of LLMs throughout various stages of the software development life cycle. Our investigation examines four dimensions: people - how LLMs affect individual developers and teams; process - how LLMs alter software engineering workflows; product - LLM impact on software quality and innovation; and society - the broader socioeconomic and ethical implications of LLM adoption. Thematic analysis of our data reveals that while LLMs have not fundamentally revolutionized the development process, they have substantially enhanced routine coding tasks, including code generation, refactoring, and debugging. Developers reported the most effective outcomes when providing LLMs with clear, well-defined problem statements, indicating that LLMs excel with decomposed problems and specific requirements. Furthermore, these early-adopters identified that LLMs offer significant value for personal and professional development, aiding in learning new languages and concepts. Early-adopters, highly skilled in software engineering and how LLMs work, identified early and persisting challenges for software engineering, such as inaccuracies in generated content and the need for careful manual review before integrating LLM outputs into production environments. Our study provides a nuanced understanding of how LLMs are shaping the landscape of software development, with their benefits, limitations, and ongoing implications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Memorization: Evaluating the True Type Inference Capabilities of LLMs for Java Code Snippets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04076v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often found on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type information such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries. Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code snippets, showing promising results. However, these results are potentially affected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public on GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023). Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs' strong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere retrieval of ground truth from training data. To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code snippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. First, utilizing Thalia, a program synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for type inference evaluation. On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped significantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall. Second, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly degraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in understanding code semantics. Third, we used delta debugging to identify the minimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference. While type inference primarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly infer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a reliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the snippets. Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from data leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code snippets. Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed benchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs for type inference tasks.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models (FMs) play an increasingly prominent role in complex software systems, such as agentic software, they introduce significant observability and debuggability challenges. Although recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate their thought processes as part of the output, in many scenarios fast-thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) are still preferred due to latency constraints. LLM-powered agents operate autonomously with opaque implicit reasoning, making it difficult to debug their unexpected behaviors or errors. In this paper, we introduce Watson, a novel framework that provides reasoning observability into the implicit reasoning processes of agents driven by fast-thinking LLMs, allowing the identification and localization of errors and guidance for corrections. We demonstrate the accuracy of the recovered implicit reasoning trace by Watson and its usefulness through debugging and improving the performance of LLM-powered agents in two scenarios: Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark and SWE-bench-lite. Using Watson, we were able to observe and identify the implicit reasoning errors, and automatically provide targeted corrections at runtime that improve the Pass@1 of agents on MMLU and SWE-bench-lite by 7.58 (13.45% relative improvement) and 7.76 (12.31% relative improvement) percentage points, respectively, without updates to models or the cognitive architecture of the agents.</p></details> |  |

Unobtrusively capturing developers' cognitive load while working on different programming tasks could help optimize developers' work experience, increase their productivity, and positively impact code quality. In this paper, we propose a study in which the IntelliJ-based IDE plugin CognitIDE is used to collect, map, and visualize software developers' physiological activity data while they are working on various software development tasks. In a feasibility study, participants completed four simulated everyday working tasks of software developers - coding, debugging, code documentation, and email writing - based on Java open source code in the IDE whilst their physiological activity was recorded. Between the tasks, the participants' perceived workload was assessed. Feasibility testing showed that CognitIDE could successfully be used for data collection sessions of one hour, which was the most extended duration tested and was well-perceived by those working with it. Furthermore, the recorded physiological activity indicated higher cognitive load during working tasks compared to baseline recordings. This suggests that cognitive load can be assessed, mapped to code positions, visualized, and discussed with participants in such study setups with CognitIDE. These promising results indicate the usefulness of the plugin for diverse study workflows in a natural IDE environment.</p></details> |  |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

QUICtester leverages active automata learning to abstract the behavior of a QUIC implementation into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. Unlike prior noncompliance checking methods, to help uncover state dependencies on event timing, QUICtester introduces the idea of state learning with event timing variations, adopting both valid and invalid input configurations, and combinations of security and transport layer parameters during learning. We use pairwise differential analysis of learned behaviour models of tested QUIC implementations to identify non-compliance instances as behaviour deviations in a property-agnostic way. This exploits the existence of the many different QUIC implementations, removing the need for validated, formal models. The diverse implementations act as cross-checking test oracles to discover non-compliance. We used QUICtester to analyze analyze 186 learned models from 19 QUIC implementations under the five security settings and discovered 55 implementation errors. Significantly, the tool uncovered a QUIC specification ambiguity resulting in an easily exploitable DoS vulnerability, led to 5 CVE assignments from developers, and two bug bounties thus far.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASIA CCS 2025.

These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.</p></details> |  |

Parf models various types of external parameters (encoding abstraction strategies) as random variables subject to probability distributions over latticed parameter spaces. It incrementally refines the probability distributions based on accumulated intermediate results generated by repeatedly sampling and analyzing, thereby ultimately yielding a set of highly accurate abstraction strategies. Parf is implemented on top of Frama-C/Eva - an off-the-shelf open-source static analyzer for C programs. Parf provides a web-based user interface facilitating the intuitive configuration of static analyzers and visualization of dynamic distribution refinement of the abstraction strategies. It further supports the identification of dominant parameters in Frama-C/Eva analysis. Benchmark experiments and a case study demonstrate the competitive performance of Parf for analyzing complex, large-scale real-world programs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional model distillation reduces size but incurs substantial costs through training separate models. We introduce ModularStarEncoder (MoSE), a 1-billion-parameter multi-exit encoder for code retrieval and classification that employs a novel Self-Distillation mechanism. This approach significantly enhances lower-layer representations, enabling flexible deployment of different model portions with favorable performance trade-offs. Our architecture improves text-to-code and code-to-code search by targeting specific encoder layers as exit heads, where higher layers guide earlier ones during training-improving intermediate representations at minimal additional cost. We further enhance MoSE with a repository-level contextual loss that maximizes training context window utilization. Additionally, we release a new dataset created through code translation that extends text-to-code benchmarks with cross-language code-to-code pairs. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Self-Distillation as a principled approach to trading inference cost for accuracy across various code understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, few techniques are available to support automatic and systematic testing for access-control changes and detecting risky changes to prevent severe consequences. As a result, those critical security configurations often lack testing, or are tested manually in an ad hoc way. This paper advocates that tests should be made available for users to test access-control configuration changes. The key challenges are such tests need to be run with production environments (to reason end-to-end behavior) and need to be performance-efficient. We present a new approach to create such tests, as a mini test environment incorporating production program and data, called ACtests. ACtests report the impacts of access-control changes, namely the requests that were denied but would be allowed after a change, and vice versa. Users can validate if the changed requests are intended or not and identify potential security vulnerabilities. We evaluate ACtests with 193 public configurations of widely-used web applications on Dockerhub. ACtests detect 168 new vulnerabilities from 72 configuration images. We report them to the image maintainers: 54 of them have been confirmed and 44 have been fixed. We also conduct in-depth experiments with five real-world deployed systems, including Wikipedia and a commercial company's web proxy. Our results show that ACtests effectively and efficiently detect all the change impacts.</p></details> |  |

Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation.

Despite extensive research on Q&A sites, being a high-level and important type of development-related knowledge, architectural solutions and their reuse are rarely explored. To fill this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study that includes a mining study and a survey study. For the mining study, we mined 984 commits and issues from 893 OSS projects on GitHub that explicitly referenced architectural solutions from SO and SWESE. For the survey study, we identified practitioners involved in the reuse of these architectural solutions and surveyed 227 of them to further understand how practitioners reuse architectural solutions from Q&A sites in their OSS development. Our findings: (1) OSS practitioners use architectural solutions from Q&A sites to solve a large variety of architectural problems, wherein Component design issue, Architectural anti-pattern, and Security issue are dominant; (2) Seven categories of architectural solutions from Q&A sites have been reused to solve those problems, among which Architectural refactoring, Use of frameworks, and Architectural tactic are the three most reused architectural solutions; (3) OSS developers often rely on ad hoc ways (e.g., informal, improvised, or unstructured approaches) to incorporate architectural solutions from SO, drawing on personal experience and intuition rather than standardized or systematic practices; (4) Using architectural solutions from SO comes with a variety of challenges, e.g., OSS practitioners complain that they need to spend significant time to adapt such architectural solutions to address design concerns raised in their OSS development, and it is challenging to use architectural solutions that are not tailored to the design context of their OSS projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects, EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based software testing baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity, targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and resilient test suites.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Do Code LLMs Do Static Analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12118v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates code LLMs' capability of static analysis during code intelligence tasks such as code summarization and generation. Code LLMs are now household names for their abilities to do some programming tasks that have heretofore required people. The process that people follow to do programming tasks has long been understood to require static analysis. For example, human programmers navigate the call graph of large programs to comprehend the different parts of those programs. Education in programming includes static analysis under the assumption that better static analysis skills beget better programming. Yet while popular culture is replete with anthropomorphic references such as LLM "reasoning", in fact code LLMs could exhibit a wholly alien thought process to humans. This paper studies the specific question of static analysis by code LLMs. We use three different static analysis tasks (callgraph generation, AST generation, and dataflow generation) and three different code intelligence tasks (code generation, summarization, and translation) with two different open-source models (Gemini and GPT-4o) and closed-source models (CodeLlaMA and Jam) as our experiments. We found that LLMs show poor performance on static analysis tasks and that pretraining on the static analysis tasks does not generalize to better performance on the code intelligence tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures, Preprint in review</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often fall short in effectively addressing these complexities, particularly in tasks such as design pattern detection for maintenance and assessment, as well as code refactoring for optimization and long-term sustainability. This growing inadequacy underscores the need for a paradigm shift in how such challenges are approached and resolved. This paper presents Analytical Software Engineering (ASE), a novel design paradigm aimed at balancing abstraction, tool accessibility, compatibility, and scalability. ASE enables effective modeling and resolution of complex software engineering problems. The paradigm is evaluated through two frameworks Behavioral-Structural Sequences (BSS) and Optimized Design Refactoring (ODR), both developed in accordance with ASE principles. BSS offers a compact, language-agnostic representation of codebases to facilitate precise design pattern detection. ODR unifies artifact and solution representations to optimize code refactoring via heuristic algorithms while eliminating iterative computational overhead. By providing a structured approach to software design challenges, ASE lays the groundwork for future research in encoding and analyzing complex software metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The C...</summary><p>The Conference's autorization to submit a preprint was granted</p></details> |

This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches primarily focus on syntactic correctness through synthetic micro-benchmarks or subjective human ratings, failing to address real-world requirements for semantic fidelity and analyst usability. We present DecompileBench, the first comprehensive framework that enables effective evaluation of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows through three key components: \textit{real-world function extraction} (comprising 23,400 functions from 130 real-world programs), \textit{runtime-aware validation}, and \textit{automated human-centric assessment} using LLM-as-Judge to quantify the effectiveness of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows. Through a systematic comparison between six industrial-strength decompilers and six recent LLM-powered approaches, we demonstrate that LLM-based methods surpass commercial tools in code understandability despite 52.2% lower functionality correctness. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based approaches to transform human-centric reverse engineering. We open source \href{https://github.com/Jennieett/DecompileBench}{DecompileBench} to provide a framework to advance research on decompilers and assist security experts in making informed tool selections based on their specific requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Current Language Models Support Code Intelligence for R Programming Language?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07793v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in developing Pre-trained Language Models for Code (Code-PLMs) have urged many areas of Software Engineering (SE) and brought breakthrough results for many SE tasks. Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models' performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeTrans: LLM-assisted Transpilation from C to Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10708v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rust is a strong contender for a memory-safe alternative to C as a "systems" programming language, but porting the vast amount of existing C code to Rust is a daunting task. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the transpilation of C code to idiomatic Rust, while ensuring that the generated code mitigates any memory-related vulnerabilities present in the original code. To that end, we present the design and implementation of SafeTrans, a framework that uses LLMs to i) transpile C code into Rust and ii) iteratively fix any compilation and runtime errors in the resulting code. A key novelty of our approach is the introduction of a few-shot guided repair technique for translation errors, which provides contextual information and example code snippets for specific error types, guiding the LLM toward the correct solution. Another novel aspect of our work is the evaluation of the security implications of the transpilation process, i.e., whether potential vulnerabilities in the original C code have been properly addressed in the translated Rust code. We experimentally evaluated SafeTrans with six leading LLMs and a set of 2,653 C programs accompanied by comprehensive unit tests, which were used for validating the correctness of the translated code. Our results show that our iterative repair strategy improves the rate of successful translations from 54% to 80% for the best-performing LLM (GPT-4o), and that all types of identified vulnerabilities in the original C code are effectively mitigated in the translated Rust code.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has focused on detecting IaC issues, Automated Program Repair (APR) remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of suitable specifications. In this work, we propose InfraFix, the first technology-agnostic framework for repairing IaC scripts. Unlike prior approaches, InfraFix allows APR techniques to be guided by diverse information sources. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach for generating repair scenarios, enabling large-scale evaluation of APR techniques for IaC. We implement and evaluate InfraFix using an SMT-based repair module and a state inference module that uses system calls, demonstrating its effectiveness across 254,288 repair scenarios with a success rate of 95.7%. Our work provides a foundation for advancing APR in IaC by enabling researchers to experiment with new state inference and repair techniques using InfraFix and to evaluate their approaches at scale with our repair scenario generation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISSTA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are Large Language Models Robust in Understanding Code Against Semantics-Preserving Mutations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10443v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

This is especially true for foundation libraries, which are used by the software packages visible to the users, being ``hidden'' themselves. The funders and other organizations need to understand the complex network of computer programs that the modern research relies upon. In this work we used CZ Software Mentions Dataset to map the dependencies of the software used in biomedical papers and find the packages critical to the software ecosystems. We propose the centrality metrics for the network of software dependencies, analyze three ecosystems (PyPi, CRAN, Bioconductor) and determine the packages with the highest centrality.</p></details> |  |

This approach is particularly valuable for scientific computing applications in which comprehensive tests are needed to prevent flawed results or conclusions. As scientific discovery becomes increasingly more complex, domain scientists couple multiple scientific computing models or simulations to solve intricate multiphysics and multiscale problems. These model-coupling applications use a hardwired coupling program or a flexible web service to link and combine different models. In this paper, we focus on the quality assurance of the more elastic web service via a combination of rigorous specification and testing methods. The application of statistical testing exposes problems ignored by pre-written unit tests and highlights areas in the code where failures might occur. We certify the model-coupling server controller with a derived reliability statistic, offering a quantitative measure to support a claim of its robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to SEKE2025</p></details> |

However, their misuse introduces vulnerabilities, potentially leading to severe data breaches and substantial financial loss. Complex API design, inadequate documentation, and insufficient security training often lead to unintentional misuse by developers. The software security community has devised and evaluated several approaches to detecting security API misuse to help developers and organizations. This study rigorously reviews the literature on detecting misuse of security APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of this critical domain. Our goal is to identify and analyze security API misuses, the detection approaches developed, and the evaluation methodologies employed along with the open research avenues to advance the state-of-the-art in this area. Employing the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, we analyzed 69 research papers. Our review has yielded (a) identification of 6 security API types; (b) classification of 30 distinct misuses; (c) categorization of detection techniques into heuristic-based and ML-based approaches; and (d) identification of 10 performance measures and 9 evaluation benchmarks. The review reveals a lack of coverage of detection approaches in several areas. We recommend that future efforts focus on aligning security API development with developers' needs and advancing standardized evaluation methods for detection technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM Computing Surveys, 2025</p></details> |

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |

We conduct an empirical study followed by grounded theory qualitative analysis to determine the quality axes to improve. Then we propose a procedure using a Large Language Model (LLM) to rewrite existing code comments along the quality axes. We implement our procedure using GPT-4o, then distil the results into a smaller model capable of being run in-house, so users can maintain data custody. We evaluate both our approach using GPT-4o and the distilled model versions. We show in an evaluation how our procedure improves code comments along the quality axes. We release all data and source code in an online repository for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

In particular, they have demonstrated remarkable utility in the task of code repair. However, common benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of code LLMs are often limited to small-scale settings. In this work, we build upon kGym, which shares a benchmark for system-level Linux kernel bugs and a platform to run experiments on the Linux kernel. This paper introduces CrashFixer, the first LLM-based software repair agent that is applicable to Linux kernel bugs. Inspired by the typical workflow of a kernel developer, we identify the key capabilities an expert developer leverages to resolve a kernel crash. Using this as our guide, we revisit the kGym platform and identify key system improvements needed to practically run LLM-based agents at the scale of the Linux kernel (50K files and 20M lines of code). We implement these changes by extending kGym to create an improved platform - called kGymSuite, which will be open-sourced. Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of various repair strategies for such complex kernel bugs and showcases the value of explicitly generating a hypothesis before attempting to fix bugs in complex systems such as the Linux kernel. We also evaluated CrashFixer's capabilities on still open bugs, and found at least two patch suggestions considered plausible to resolve the reported bug.</p></details> |  |

Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>JEL C...</summary><p>JEL Classification: O31, C88, J24, O35, L86</p></details> |
| **[Grouptuner: Efficient Group-Aware Compiler Auto-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08598v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern compilers typically provide hundreds of options to optimize program performance, but users often cannot fully leverage them due to the huge number of options. While standard optimization combinations (e.g., -O3) provide reasonable defaults, they often fail to deliver near-peak performance across diverse programs and architectures. To address this challenge, compiler auto-tuning techniques have emerged to automate the discovery of improved option combinations. Existing techniques typically focus on identifying critical options and prioritizing them during the search to improve efficiency. However, due to limited tuning iterations, the resulting data is often sparse and noisy, making it highly challenging to accurately identify critical options. As a result, these algorithms are prone to being trapped in local optima. To address this limitation, we propose GroupTuner, a group-aware auto-tuning technique that directly applies localized mutation to coherent option groups based on historically best-performing combinations, thus avoiding explicitly identifying critical options. By forgoing the need to know precisely which options are most important, GroupTuner maximizes the use of existing performance data, ensuring more targeted exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTuner can efficiently discover competitive option combinations, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.39% over -O3 while requiring only 77.21% of the time compared to the random search algorithm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in the ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES'25), June 16-17, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea</p></details> |

However, these applications remain insufficiently automated and struggle to effectively integrate various types of information during the programming process, including coding history, current code, and user instructions. In this work, we propose a new conversational framework that comprehensively integrates these information sources, collect data to train our models and evaluate their performance. Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well models align with different types of information and the quality of their outputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to comprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance tasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline, Programming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources, such as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically generate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally, using this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and develop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models of comparable size. This framework unifies applications such as inline chat and automated editing, contributes to the advancement of coding assistants.

For instance, hard-coded credentials planted in the code of a file server application would enable maliciously logging into all deployed instances of this application. Confirmed software supply chain attacks have led to the injection of backdoors into popular open-source projects, and backdoors have been discovered in various router firmware. Manual code auditing for backdoors is challenging and existing semi-automated approaches can handle only a limited scope of programs and backdoors, while requiring manual reverse-engineering of the audited (binary) program. Graybox fuzzing (automated semi-randomized testing) has grown in popularity due to its success in discovering vulnerabilities and hence stands as a strong candidate for improved backdoor detection. However, current fuzzing knowledge does not offer any means to detect the triggering of a backdoor at runtime. In this work we introduce ROSA, a novel approach (and tool) which combines a state-of-the-art fuzzer (AFL++) with a new metamorphic test oracle, capable of detecting runtime backdoor triggers. To facilitate the evaluation of ROSA, we have created ROSARUM, the first openly available benchmark for assessing the detection of various backdoors in diverse programs. Experimental evaluation shows that ROSA has a level of robustness, speed and automation similar to classical fuzzing. It finds all 17 authentic or synthetic backdooors from ROSARUM in 1h30 on average. Compared to existing detection tools, it can handle a diversity of backdoors and programs and it does not rely on manual reverse-engineering of the fuzzed binary code.</p></details> |  |

Software developers often leverage both general-purpose and code-specialized LLMs to revise existing code or even generate a whole function from scratch. These capabilities are also beneficial in no-code or low-code contexts, in which one can write programs without a technical background. However, due to their internal design, LLMs are prone to generating hallucinations, which are incorrect, nonsensical, and not justifiable information but difficult to identify its presence. This problem also occurs when generating source code. Once hallucinated code is produced, it is often challenging for users to identify and fix it, especially when such hallucinations can be identified under specific execution paths. As a result, the hallucinated code may remain unnoticed within the codebase. This survey investigates recent studies and techniques relevant to hallucinations generated by CodeLLMs. We categorize the types of hallucinations in the code generated by CodeLLMs, review existing benchmarks and mitigation strategies, and identify open challenges. Based on these findings, this survey outlines further research directions in the detection and removal of hallucinations produced by CodeLLMs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Detecting the Root Cause Code Lines in Bug-Fixing Commits by Heterogeneous Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01022v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous growth in the scale and complexity of software systems, defect remediation has become increasingly difficult and costly. Automated defect prediction tools can proactively identify software changes prone to defects within software projects, thereby enhancing software development efficiency. However, existing work in heterogeneous and complex software projects continues to face challenges, such as struggling with heterogeneous commit structures and ignoring cross-line dependencies in code changes, which ultimately reduce the accuracy of defect identification. To address these challenges, we propose an approach called RC_Detector. RC_Detector comprises three main components: the bug-fixing graph construction component, the code semantic aggregation component, and the cross-line semantic retention component. The bug-fixing graph construction component identifies the code syntax structures and program dependencies within bug-fixing commits and transforms them into heterogeneous graph formats by converting the source code into vector representations. The code semantic aggregation component adapts to heterogeneous data by using heterogeneous attention to learn the hidden semantic representation of target code lines. The cross-line semantic retention component regulates propagated semantic information by using attenuation and reinforcement gates derived from old and new code semantic representations, effectively preserving cross-line semantic relationships. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our model by collecting data from 87 open-source projects, including 675 bug-fixing commits. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements of 83.15%,96.83%,78.71%,74.15%,54.14%,91.66%,91.66%, and 34.82% in MFR, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Failure of Plagiarism Detection in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08244v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plagiarism in programming courses remains a persistent challenge, especially in competitive programming contexts where assignments often have unique, known solutions. This paper examines why traditional code plagiarism detection methods frequently fail in these environments and explores the implications of emerging factors such as generative AI (genAI). Drawing on the author's experience teaching a Competitive Programming 1 (CP1) course over seven semesters at Purdue University (with $\approx 100$ students each term) and completely redesigning the CP1/2/3 course sequence, we provide an academically grounded analysis. We review literature on code plagiarism in computer science education, survey current detection tools (Moss, Kattis, etc.) and methods (manual review, code-authorship interviews), and analyze their strengths and limitations. Experience-based observations are presented to illustrate real-world detection failures and successes. We find that widely-used automated similarity checkers can be thwarted by simple code transformations or novel AI-generated code, while human-centric approaches like oral interviews, though effective, are labor-intensive. The paper concludes with opinions and preliminary recommendations for improving academic integrity in programming courses, advocating for a multi-faceted approach that combines improved detection algorithms, mastery-based learning techniques, and authentic assessment practices to better ensure code originality.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Code Generation via Bidirectional Comment-Level Mutual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07768v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation. However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before. Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation. Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis. Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach. Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Byam: Fixing Breaking Dependency Updates with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07522v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) facilitate the integration of third-party dependencies within the code of client applications. However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code. These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We experiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review on Neural Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07425v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation aims to convert code from one programming language to another automatically. It is motivated by the need for multi-language software development and legacy system migration. In recent years, neural code translation has gained significant attention, driven by rapid advancements in deep learning and large language models. Researchers have proposed various techniques to improve neural code translation quality. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive systematic literature review has been conducted to summarize the key techniques and challenges in this field. To fill this research gap, we collected 57 primary studies covering the period 2020~2025 on neural code translation. These studies are analyzed from seven key perspectives: task characteristics, data preprocessing, code modeling, model construction, post-processing, evaluation subjects, and evaluation metrics. Our analysis reveals current research trends, identifies unresolved challenges, and shows potential directions for future work. These findings can provide valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the field of neural code translation.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[A Preliminary Study of Large Language Models for Multilingual Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07376v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based approaches, particularly those leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs), have shown promise in automated software vulnerability detection. However, existing methods are predominantly limited to specific programming languages, restricting their applicability in multilingual settings. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities and enhanced semantic understanding, presenting a potential solution to this limitation. While existing studies have explored LLMs for vulnerability detection, their detection performance remains unknown for multilingual vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conducted a preliminary study to evaluate the effectiveness of PLMs and state-of-the-art LLMs across seven popular programming languages. Our findings reveal that the PLM CodeT5P achieves the best performance in multilingual vulnerability detection, particularly in identifying the most critical vulnerabilities. Based on these results, we further discuss the potential of LLMs in advancing real-world multilingual vulnerability detection. This work represents an initial step toward exploring PLMs and LLMs for cross-language vulnerability detection, offering key insights for future research and practical deployment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Synthetic Code Surgery: Repairing Bugs and Vulnerabilities with LLMs and Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07372v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel methodology for enhancing Automated Program Repair (APR) through synthetic data generation utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of high-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple programming languages. The proposed approach addresses this limitation through a two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous quality assessment. Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate approximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12 programming languages and 13 bug categories. Subsequently, these samples underwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code quality, security, performance, and completeness. Experimental evaluation on the VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in Perfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset outperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in certain scenarios. The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical testing, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference analysis. Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing systems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy. This research establishes a self-bootstrapping paradigm in which LLMs generate and evaluate their own training data, potentially transforming approaches to data scarcity across software engineering tasks and advancing the development of robust, adaptable tools for automated code maintenance.</p></details> |  |

As large language models (LLMs) continue to excel in diverse language understanding and generation tasks, their potential in decoding complex binary data structures becomes evident. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks in this domain limits the assessment and comparison of LLM's capabilities in binary analysis and hinders the progress of research and practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce BinMetric, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the performance of large language models on binary analysis tasks. BinMetric comprises 1,000 questions derived from 20 real-world open-source projects across 6 practical binary analysis tasks, including decompilation, code summarization, assembly instruction generation, etc., which reflect actual reverse engineering scenarios. Our empirical study on this benchmark investigates the binary analysis capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing their strengths and limitations in this field. The findings indicate that while LLMs show strong potential, challenges still exist, particularly in the areas of precise binary lifting and assembly synthesis. In summary, BinMetric makes a significant step forward in measuring the binary analysis capabilities of LLMs, establishing a new benchmark leaderboard, and our study provides valuable insights for the future development of these LLMs in software security.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

| **[CI at Scale: Lean, Green, and Fast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03440v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining a "green" mainline branch, where all builds pass successfully, is crucial but challenging in fast-paced, large-scale software development environments, particularly with concurrent code changes in large monorepos. SubmitQueue, a system designed to address these challenges, speculatively executes builds and only lands changes with successful outcomes. However, despite its effectiveness, the system faces inefficiencies in resource utilization, leading to a high rate of premature build aborts and delays in landing smaller changes blocked by larger conflicting ones. This paper introduces enhancements to SubmitQueue, focusing on optimizing resource usage and improving build prioritization. Central to this is our innovative probabilistic model, which distinguishes between changes with shorter and longer build times to prioritize builds for more efficient scheduling. By leveraging a machine learning model to predict build times and incorporating this into the probabilistic framework, we expedite the landing of smaller changes blocked by conflicting larger time-consuming changes. Additionally, introducing a concept of speculation threshold ensures that only the most likely builds are executed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption. After implementing these enhancements across Uber's major monorepos (Go, iOS, and Android), we observed a reduction in Continuous Integration (CI) resource usage by approximately 53%, CPU usage by 44%, and P95 waiting times by 37%. These improvements highlight the enhanced efficiency of SubmitQueue in managing large-scale software changes while maintaining a green mainline.</p></details> |  |

These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Prompts Don't Say: Understanding and Managing Underspecification in LLM Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13360v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building LLM-powered software requires developers to communicate their requirements through natural language, but developer prompts are frequently underspecified, failing to fully capture many user-important requirements. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification, showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops by more than 20%. We then demonstrate that simply adding more requirements to a prompt does not reliably improve performance, due to LLMs' limited instruction-following capabilities and competing constraints, and standard prompt optimizers do not offer much help. To address this, we introduce novel requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that can improve performance by 4.8% on average over baselines that naively specify everything in the prompt. Beyond prompt optimization, we envision that effectively managing prompt underspecification requires a broader process, including proactive requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sense and Sensitivity: Examining the Influence of Semantic Recall on Long Context Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13353v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability. Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval) and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall. Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity, potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context information.</p></details> |  |
| **[MigrationBench: Repository-Level Code Migration Benchmark from Java 8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09569v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of powerful large language models (LLMs) in recent years, a wide range of software engineering tasks can now be addressed using LLMs, significantly enhancing productivity and scalability. Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on code generation and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MigrationBench with a distinct focus: code migration. MigrationBench aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java $8$ to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java $17$, $21$), including a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java $17$. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves $62.33\%$ and $27.33\%$ success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience/migrationbench-68125452fc21a4564b92b6c3 and https://github.com/amazon-science/MigrationBench respectively.</p></details> |  |

They possess impressive reasoning capabilities and are capable of handling complex problems, as shown by their steadily improving scores on coding and mathematical benchmarks. However, are the models currently available truly capable of addressing real-world challenges, such as those found in the automotive industry? How well can they understand high-level, abstract instructions? Can they translate these instructions directly into functional code, or do they still need help and supervision? In this work, we put one of the current state-of-the-art models to the test. We evaluate its performance in the task of translating abstract requirements, extracted from automotive standards and documents, into configuration code for CARLA simulations.</p></details> |  |

Parf models various types of external parameters (encoding abstraction strategies) as random variables subject to probability distributions over latticed parameter spaces. It incrementally refines the probability distributions based on accumulated intermediate results generated by repeatedly sampling and analyzing, thereby ultimately yielding a set of highly accurate abstraction strategies. Parf is implemented on top of Frama-C/Eva - an off-the-shelf open-source static analyzer for C programs. Parf provides a web-based user interface facilitating the intuitive configuration of static analyzers and visualization of dynamic distribution refinement of the abstraction strategies. It further supports the identification of dominant parameters in Frama-C/Eva analysis. Benchmark experiments and a case study demonstrate the competitive performance of Parf for analyzing complex, large-scale real-world programs.</p></details> |  |

Building upon the pre-existing, yet rudimentary CASTLE scheme, Prink for the first time introduces semantics-aware ks-anonymization of non-numerical (such as categorical or hierarchically generalizable) streaming data in a information loss-optimized manner. In addition, it provides native integration into Apache Flink, one of the prevailing frameworks for enterprise-grade stream data processing in numerous application domains. Our contributions excel the previously established state of the art for the privacy guarantee-providing anonymization of streaming data in that they 1) allow to include non-numerical data in the anonymization process, 2) provide discrete datapoints instead of aggregates, thereby facilitating flexible data use, 3) are applicable in real-world system contexts with minimal integration efforts, and 4) are experimentally proven to raise acceptable performance overheads and information loss in realistic settings. With these characteristics, Prink provides an anonymization approach which is practically feasible for a broad variety of real-world, enterprise-grade stream processing applications and environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for ARES 2025</p></details> |
| **[Aspects of complexity in automotive software systems and their relation to maintainability effort. A case study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13135v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Large embedded systems in vehicles tend to grow in size and complexity, which causes challenges when maintaining these systems. Objective: We explore how developers perceive the relation between maintainability effort and various sources of complexity. Methods: We conduct a case study at Scania AB, a heavy vehicle OEM. The units of analysis are two large software systems and their development teams/organizations. Results: Our results show that maintainability effort is driven by system internal complexity in the form of variant management and complex hardware control tasks. The maintainability is also influenced by emergent complexity caused by the system's longevity and constant growth. Besides these system-internal complexities, maintainability effort is also influenced by external complexities, such as organizational coordination and business needs. During the study, developer trade-off strategies for minimizing maintainability effort emerged. Conclusions: Complexity is a good proxy of maintainability effort, and allows developers to create strategies for managing the maintainability effort. Adequate complexity metrics include both external aspects -- e.g., coordination complexity -- and internal ones -- e.g., McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Retrieval Augmented Generation for Object Constraint Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13129v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is essential for defining precise constraints within Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). However, manually writing OCL rules is complex and time-consuming. This study explores the optimization of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for automating OCL rule generation, focusing on the impact of different retrieval strategies. We evaluate three retrieval approaches $\unicode{x2013}$ BM25 (lexical-based), BERT-based (semantic retrieval), and SPLADE (sparse-vector retrieval) $\unicode{x2013}$ analyzing their effectiveness in providing relevant context for a large language model. To further assess our approach, we compare and benchmark our retrieval-optimized generation results against PathOCL, a state-of-the-art graph-based method. We directly compare BM25, BERT, and SPLADE retrieval methods with PathOCL to understand how different retrieval methods perform for a unified evaluation framework. Our experimental results, focusing on retrieval-augmented generation, indicate that while retrieval can enhance generation accuracy, its effectiveness depends on the retrieval method and the number of retrieved chunks (k). BM25 underperforms the baseline, whereas semantic approaches (BERT and SPLADE) achieve better results, with SPLADE performing best at lower k values. However, excessive retrieval with high k parameter can lead to retrieving irrelevant chunks which degrades model performance. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing retrieval configurations to balance context relevance and output consistency. This research provides insights into improving OCL rule generation using RAG and underscores the need for tailoring retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Hierarchical Self-Distillation Enhances Early Layer Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03008v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying language models often requires navigating accuracy vs. performance trade-offs to meet latency constraints while preserving utility. Traditional model distillation reduces size but incurs substantial costs through training separate models. We introduce ModularStarEncoder (MoSE), a 1-billion-parameter multi-exit encoder for code retrieval and classification that employs a novel Self-Distillation mechanism. This approach significantly enhances lower-layer representations, enabling flexible deployment of different model portions with favorable performance trade-offs. Our architecture improves text-to-code and code-to-code search by targeting specific encoder layers as exit heads, where higher layers guide earlier ones during training-improving intermediate representations at minimal additional cost. We further enhance MoSE with a repository-level contextual loss that maximizes training context window utilization. Additionally, we release a new dataset created through code translation that extends text-to-code benchmarks with cross-language code-to-code pairs. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Self-Distillation as a principled approach to trading inference cost for accuracy across various code understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |

However, in practical applications, there remains a gap between current commonly used code completion evaluation metrics and users' actual perception. To address this issue, we propose two evaluation metrics for code completion tasks--LCP and ROUGE-LCP, from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of effective structural semantic modeling and cross-module dependency information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and Semantically-Reordered Code Graph (SPSR-Graph). Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed evaluation metrics in terms of user perception consistency, as well as the effectiveness of the data processing method in enhancing model performance.</p></details> | 14 pages,8 figures |

| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

By running target software natively on ARM-based hosts with hardware-based virtualization extensions, our method eliminates the need for instruction-set simulators, which significantly improves performance. We present a multicore SystemC-TLM-based CPU model that can be used as a drop-in replacement for an instruction-set simulator. It places no special requirements on the host system, making it compatible with various environments. Benchmark results show that our ARM-on-ARM-based virtual platform achieves up to 10 x speedup over traditional instruction-set-simulator-based models on compute-intensive workloads. Depending on the benchmark, speedups increase to more than 100 x.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference 2025 (DATE '25)</p></details> |
| **[CPRet: A Dataset, Benchmark, and Model for Retrieval in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12925v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

To adopt CI/CD, software developers need to configure their projects using dedicated YML configuration files. Mobile apps have distinct characteristics with respect to CI/CD practices, such as testing on various emulators and deploying to app stores. However, little is known about the challenges and added value of adopting CI/CD in mobile apps and how developers maintain such a practice. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on CI/CD practices in 2,557 Android apps adopting four popular CI/CD services, namely GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. We also compare our findings with those reported in prior research on general CI/CD practices to situate them within broader trends. We observe a lack of commonality and standardization across CI/CD services and Android apps, leading to complex YML configurations and associated maintenance efforts. We also observe that CI/CD configurations focus primarily on the build setup, with around half of the projects performing standard testing and only 9% incorporating deployment. In addition, we find that CI/CD configurations are changed bi-monthly on average, with frequent maintenance correlating with active issue tracking, project size/age, and community engagement. Our qualitative analysis of commits uncovered 11 themes in CI/CD maintenance activities, with over a third of the changes focusing on improving workflows and fixing build issues, whereas another third involves updating the build environment, tools, and dependencies. Our study emphasizes the necessity for automation and AI-powered tools to improve CI/CD processes for mobile apps and advocates creating adaptable open-source tools to efficiently manage resources, especially in testing and deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoGEEval: A Multimodal and Automated Framework for Geospatial Code Generation on GEE with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12900v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial code generation is emerging as a key direction in the integration of artificial intelligence and geoscientific analysis. However, there remains a lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench) comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework integrates both question generation and answer verification components to enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to domain-specific code translation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Testing Access-Control Configuration Changes for Web Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12770v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Access-control misconfigurations are among the main causes of today's data breaches in web applications. However, few techniques are available to support automatic and systematic testing for access-control changes and detecting risky changes to prevent severe consequences. As a result, those critical security configurations often lack testing, or are tested manually in an ad hoc way. This paper advocates that tests should be made available for users to test access-control configuration changes. The key challenges are such tests need to be run with production environments (to reason end-to-end behavior) and need to be performance-efficient. We present a new approach to create such tests, as a mini test environment incorporating production program and data, called ACtests. ACtests report the impacts of access-control changes, namely the requests that were denied but would be allowed after a change, and vice versa. Users can validate if the changed requests are intended or not and identify potential security vulnerabilities. We evaluate ACtests with 193 public configurations of widely-used web applications on Dockerhub. ACtests detect 168 new vulnerabilities from 72 configuration images. We report them to the image maintainers: 54 of them have been confirmed and 44 have been fixed. We also conduct in-depth experiments with five real-world deployed systems, including Wikipedia and a commercial company's web proxy. Our results show that ACtests effectively and efficiently detect all the change impacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02355v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation.

| **[An Automated Blackbox Noncompliance Checker for QUIC Server Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12690v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop QUICtester, an automated approach for uncovering non-compliant behaviors in the ratified QUIC protocol implementations (RFC 9000/9001). QUICtester leverages active automata learning to abstract the behavior of a QUIC implementation into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. Unlike prior noncompliance checking methods, to help uncover state dependencies on event timing, QUICtester introduces the idea of state learning with event timing variations, adopting both valid and invalid input configurations, and combinations of security and transport layer parameters during learning. We use pairwise differential analysis of learned behaviour models of tested QUIC implementations to identify non-compliance instances as behaviour deviations in a property-agnostic way. This exploits the existence of the many different QUIC implementations, removing the need for validated, formal models. The diverse implementations act as cross-checking test oracles to discover non-compliance. We used QUICtester to analyze analyze 186 learned models from 19 QUIC implementations under the five security settings and discovered 55 implementation errors. Significantly, the tool uncovered a QUIC specification ambiguity resulting in an easily exploitable DoS vulnerability, led to 5 CVE assignments from developers, and two bug bounties thus far.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASIA CCS 2025.

| **[Understanding and Detecting Peer Dependency Resolving Loop in npm Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12676v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the default package manager for Node.js, npm has become one of the largest package management systems in the world. To facilitate dependency management for developers, npm supports a special type of dependency, Peer Dependency, whose installation and usage differ from regular dependencies. However, conflicts between peer dependencies can trap the npm client into infinite loops, leading to resource exhaustion and system crashes. We name this problem PeerSpin. Although PeerSpin poses a severe risk to ecosystems, it was overlooked by previous studies, and its impacts have not been explored. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts the first in-depth study to understand and detect PeerSpin in the npm ecosystem. First, by systematically analyzing the npm dependency resolution, we identify the root cause of PeerSpin and characterize two peer dependency patterns to guide detection. Second, we propose a novel technique called Node-Replacement-Conflict based PeerSpin Detection, which leverages the state of the directory tree during dependency resolution to achieve accurate and efficient PeerSpin detection. Based on this technique, we developed a tool called PeerChecker to detect PeerSpin. Finally, we apply PeerChecker to the entire NPM ecosystem and find that 5,662 packages, totaling 72,968 versions, suffer from PeerSpin. Up until now, we confirmed 28 real PeerSpin problems by reporting them to the package maintainer. We also open source all PeerSpin analysis implementations, tools, and data sets to the public to help the community detect PeerSpin issues and enhance the reliability of the npm ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decompile-Bench: Million-Scale Binary-Source Function Pairs for Real-World Binary Decompilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12668v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LLM-based decompilers have been shown effective to convert low-level binaries into human-readable source code. However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLM decompilation technology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Decompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmark Decompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues. We further explore commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide a thorough assessment of the studied LLM decompilers and find that fine-tuning with Decompile-Bench causes a 20% improvement over previous benchmarks in terms of the re-executability rate. Our code and data has been released in HuggingFace and Github. https://github.com/albertan017/LLM4Decompile</p></details> |  |
| **[Shaky Structures: The Wobbly World of Causal Graphs in Software Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12554v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal graphs are widely used in software engineering to document and explore causal relationships. Though widely used, they may also be wildly misleading. Causal structures generated from SE data can be highly variable. This instability is so significant that conclusions drawn from one graph may be totally reversed in another, even when both graphs are learned from the same or very similar project data. To document this problem, this paper examines causal graphs found by four causal graph generators (PC, FCI, GES, and LiNGAM) when applied to 23 data sets, relating to three different SE tasks: (a) learning how configuration options are selected for different properties; (b) understanding how management choices affect software projects; and (c) defect prediction. Graphs were compared between (a) different projects exploring the same task; (b) version i and i + 1 of a system; (c) different 90% samples of the data; and (d) small variations in the causal graph generator. Measured in terms of the Jaccard index of the number of edges shared by two different graphs, over half the edges were changed by these treatments. Hence, we conclude two things. Firstly, specific conclusions found by causal graph generators about how two specific variables affect each other may not generalize since those conclusions could be reversed by minor changes in how those graphs are generated. Secondly, before researchers can report supposedly general conclusions from causal graphs (e.g., "long functions cause more defects"), they should test that such conclusions hold over the numerous causal graphs that might be generated from the same data.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables, submitted to EMSE</p></details> |

Despite extensive research on Q&A sites, being a high-level and important type of development-related knowledge, architectural solutions and their reuse are rarely explored. To fill this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study that includes a mining study and a survey study. For the mining study, we mined 984 commits and issues from 893 OSS projects on GitHub that explicitly referenced architectural solutions from SO and SWESE. For the survey study, we identified practitioners involved in the reuse of these architectural solutions and surveyed 227 of them to further understand how practitioners reuse architectural solutions from Q&A sites in their OSS development. Our findings: (1) OSS practitioners use architectural solutions from Q&A sites to solve a large variety of architectural problems, wherein Component design issue, Architectural anti-pattern, and Security issue are dominant; (2) Seven categories of architectural solutions from Q&A sites have been reused to solve those problems, among which Architectural refactoring, Use of frameworks, and Architectural tactic are the three most reused architectural solutions; (3) OSS developers often rely on ad hoc ways (e.g., informal, improvised, or unstructured approaches) to incorporate architectural solutions from SO, drawing on personal experience and intuition rather than standardized or systematic practices; (4) Using architectural solutions from SO comes with a variety of challenges, e.g., OSS practitioners complain that they need to spend significant time to adapt such architectural solutions to address design concerns raised in their OSS development, and it is challenging to use architectural solutions that are not tailored to the design context of their OSS projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 2025</p></details> |

The environment combines the flexibility, determinism, and observability of software-only simulation with the fidelity and depth normally attained only by real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing. Ultimately, this work enables an engineering process in which flight software is continuously improved and delivered in its final, flight-ready form, and which reduces the cost of design changes and software revisions with respect to a traditional linear development process. Three key methods not found in existing tools enable this environment's novel capabilities: first, a hybrid event-driven simulation architecture that combines continuous-time and discrete-event simulation paradigms; second, a lightweight application-layer software virtualization design that allows executing compiled flight software binaries while modeling process scheduling, input/output, and memory use; and third, high-fidelity models for the multi-spacecraft space environment, including for wireless communication, relative sensing such as differential GPS and cameras, and flight computer health metrics like heap exhaustion and fragmentation. The simulation environment's capabilities are applied to the iterative development and testing of two flight-ready software packages: the guidance, navigation, and control software for the VISORS mission, and the Stanford Space Rendezvous Laboratory software kit for rendezvous and proximity operations. Results from 33 months of flight software development demonstrate the use of this simulation environment to rapidly and reliably identify and resolve defects, characterize navigation and control performance, and scrutinize implementation details like memory allocation and inter-spacecraft network protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[EvoGPT: Enhancing Test Suite Robustness via LLM-Based Generation and Genetic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12424v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for automated unit test generation. We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects, EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based software testing baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity, targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and resilient test suites.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSS-Bench: Benchmark Generator for Coding LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12331v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In light of the rapid adoption of AI coding assistants, LLM-assisted development has become increasingly prevalent, creating an urgent need for robust evaluation of generated code quality. Existing benchmarks often require extensive manual effort to create static datasets, rely on indirect or insufficiently challenging tasks, depend on non-scalable ground truth, or neglect critical low-level security evaluations, particularly memory-safety issues. In this work, we introduce OSS-Bench, a benchmark generator that automatically constructs large-scale, live evaluation tasks from real-world open-source software. OSS-Bench replaces functions with LLM-generated code and evaluates them using three natural metrics: compilability, functional correctness, and memory safety, leveraging robust signals like compilation failures, test-suite violations, and sanitizer alerts as ground truth. In our evaluation, the benchmark, instantiated as OSS-Bench(php) and OSS-Bench(sql), profiles 17 diverse LLMs, revealing insights such as intra-family behavioral patterns and inconsistencies between model size and performance. Our results demonstrate that OSS-Bench mitigates overfitting by leveraging the evolving complexity of OSS and highlights LLMs' limited understanding of low-level code security via extended fuzzing experiments. Overall, OSS-Bench offers a practical and scalable framework for benchmarking the real-world coding capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[On the Challenges of Fuzzing Techniques via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00350v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the modern era where software plays a pivotal role, software security and vulnerability analysis are essential for secure software development. Fuzzing test, as an efficient and traditional software testing method, has been widely adopted across various domains. Meanwhile, the rapid development in Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated their application in the field of software testing, demonstrating remarkable performance. As existing fuzzing test techniques are not fully automated and software vulnerabilities continue to evolve, there is a growing interest in leveraging large language models to generate fuzzing test. In this paper, we present a systematic overview of the developments that utilize large language models for the fuzzing test. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that covers the intersection of three areas, including LLMs, fuzzing test, and fuzzing test generated based on LLMs. A statistical analysis and discussion of the literature are conducted by summarizing the state-of-the-art methods up to date of the submission. Our work also investigates the potential for widespread deployment and application of fuzzing test techniques generated by LLMs in the future, highlighting their promise for advancing automated software testing practices.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have demonstrated outstanding performance in understanding and generating contexts for different scenarios, they are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks, which are mostly via text input. In this paper, we introduce the first voice-based jailbreak attack against multimodal LLMs, termed as Flanking Attack, which can process different types of input simultaneously towards the multimodal LLMs. Our work is motivated by recent advancements in monolingual voice-driven large language models, which have introduced new attack surfaces beyond traditional text-based vulnerabilities for LLMs. To investigate these risks, we examine the state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, which can be accessed via different types of inputs such as audio input, focusing on how adversarial prompts can bypass its defense mechanisms. We propose a novel strategy, in which the disallowed prompt is flanked by benign, narrative-driven prompts. It is integrated in the Flanking Attack which attempts to humanizes the interaction context and execute the attack through a fictional setting. Further, to better evaluate the attack performance, we present a semi-automated self-assessment framework for policy violation detection. We demonstrate that Flanking Attack is capable of manipulating state-of-the-art LLMs into generating misaligned and forbidden outputs, which achieves an average attack success rate ranging from 0.67 to 0.93 across seven forbidden scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Automated Web-Form-Test Generation: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09965v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing web forms is an essential activity for ensuring the quality of web applications. It typically involves evaluating the interactions between users and forms. Automated test-case generation remains a challenge for web-form testing: Due to the complex, multi-level structure of web pages, it can be difficult to automatically capture their inherent contextual information for inclusion in the tests. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential for contextual text generation. This motivated us to explore how they could generate automated tests for web forms, making use of the contextual information within form elements. To the best of our knowledge, no comparative study examining different LLMs has yet been reported for web-form-test generation. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study investigating the effectiveness of 11 LLMs on 146 web forms from 30 open-source Java web applications. In addition, we propose three HTML-structure-pruning methods to extract key contextual information. The experimental results show that different LLMs can achieve different testing effectiveness. Compared with GPT-4, the other LLMs had difficulty generating appropriate tests for the web forms: Their successfully-submitted rates (SSRs) decreased by 9.10% to 74.15%. Our findings also show that, for all LLMs, when the designed prompts include complete and clear contextual information about the web forms, more effective web-form tests were generated. Specifically, when using Parser-Processed HTML for Task Prompt (PH-P), the SSR averaged 70.63%, higher than the 60.21% for Raw HTML for Task Prompt (RH-P) and 50.27% for LLM-Processed HTML for Task Prompt (LH-P). Finally, this paper also highlights strategies for selecting LLMs based on performance metrics, and for optimizing the prompt design to improve the quality of the web-form tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

In engineering practice, significant expert effort is needed for this translation. Our approach, EasyFR, streamlines the process by recommending Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) sequences for the given abstract features to guide Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in producing cohesive FR statements. By analyzing ten diverse datasets, we induce two variable SRL templates, each including two configurable parts. For concrete features, our proposed Key2Temp model can construct the appropriate variant of the SRL template by identifying a variable SRL template and placing the feature tokens in the appropriate slots. In this way, our approach reframes the process of requirement generation into a structured slot-filling activity. Experimental validation on four open datasets demonstrates that EasyFR outperforms three advanced Natural language generation (NLG) approaches, including GPT4, particularly when existing FRs are available for training. The positive influence of our SRL template variant recommendations is further confirmed through an ablation study. We believe that our results indicate a notable step forward in the realm of automated requirements synthesis, holding potential to improve the process of requirements specification in future software projects.</p></details> | 27pages |

| **[EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Do Code LLMs Do Static Analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12118v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates code LLMs' capability of static analysis during code intelligence tasks such as code summarization and generation. Code LLMs are now household names for their abilities to do some programming tasks that have heretofore required people. The process that people follow to do programming tasks has long been understood to require static analysis. For example, human programmers navigate the call graph of large programs to comprehend the different parts of those programs. Education in programming includes static analysis under the assumption that better static analysis skills beget better programming. Yet while popular culture is replete with anthropomorphic references such as LLM "reasoning", in fact code LLMs could exhibit a wholly alien thought process to humans. This paper studies the specific question of static analysis by code LLMs. We use three different static analysis tasks (callgraph generation, AST generation, and dataflow generation) and three different code intelligence tasks (code generation, summarization, and translation) with two different open-source models (Gemini and GPT-4o) and closed-source models (CodeLlaMA and Jam) as our experiments. We found that LLMs show poor performance on static analysis tasks and that pretraining on the static analysis tasks does not generalize to better performance on the code intelligence tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures, Preprint in review</p></details> |

Traditional systems often suffer from overflow, synchronization drift, and storage inefficiencies. We propose a modular Time Tagging (TT) agent that uses a 1 pulse per second (PPS) signal from White Rabbit (WR) devices to achieve network-wide synchronization, while applying real-time calibration, overflow mitigation, and compression. A live two-lab entanglement distribution experiment validated the system's performance, achieving synchronized coincidence detection at 25,000 counts/sec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Sneaky Patterns of Pop-up Windows in the Mobile Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12056v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mobile applications, Pop-up window (PoW) plays a crucial role in improving user experience, guiding user actions, and delivering key information. Unfortunately, the excessive use of PoWs severely degrades the user experience. These PoWs often sneakily mislead users in their choices, employing tactics that subtly manipulate decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first in-depth study on the Sneaky patterns in the mobile ecosystem. Our research first highlights five distinct Sneaky patterns that compromise user experience, including text mislead, UI mislead, forced action, out of context and privacy-intrusive by default. To further evaluate the impact of such Sneaky patterns at large, we developed an automated analysis pipeline called Poker, to tackle the challenges of identifying, dismissing, and collecting diverse PoWs in real-world apps. Evaluation results showed that Poker achieves high precision and recall in detecting PoWs, efficiently dismissed over 88% of PoWs with minimal user interaction, with good robustness and reliability in comprehensive app exploration. Further, our systematic analysis over the top 100 popular apps in China and U.S. revealing that both regions displayed significant ratios of Sneaky patterns, particularly in promotional contexts, with high occurrences in categories such as shopping and video apps. The findings highlight the strategic deployment of Sneaky tactics that compromise user trust and ethical app design.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically refactoring C code into HLS-compatible formats. We present a case study using an LLM to rewrite C code for NIST 800-22 randomness tests, a QuickSort algorithm, and AES-128 into HLS-synthesizable C. The LLM iteratively transforms the C code guided by the system prompt and tool's feedback, implementing functions like streaming data and hardware-specific signals. With the hindsight obtained from the case study, we implement a fully automated framework to refactor C code into HLS-compatible formats using LLMs. To tackle complex designs, we implement a preprocessing step that breaks down the hierarchy in order to approach the problem in a divide-and-conquer bottom-up way. We validated our framework on three ciphers, one hash function, five NIST 800-22 randomness tests, and a QuickSort algorithm. Our results show a high success rate on benchmarks that are orders of magnitude more complex than what has been achieved generating Verilog with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems</p></details> |
| **[Introduction to Analytical Software Engineering Design Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11979v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As modern software systems expand in scale and complexity, the challenges associated with their modeling and formulation grow increasingly intricate. Traditional approaches often fall short in effectively addressing these complexities, particularly in tasks such as design pattern detection for maintenance and assessment, as well as code refactoring for optimization and long-term sustainability. This growing inadequacy underscores the need for a paradigm shift in how such challenges are approached and resolved. This paper presents Analytical Software Engineering (ASE), a novel design paradigm aimed at balancing abstraction, tool accessibility, compatibility, and scalability. ASE enables effective modeling and resolution of complex software engineering problems. The paradigm is evaluated through two frameworks Behavioral-Structural Sequences (BSS) and Optimized Design Refactoring (ODR), both developed in accordance with ASE principles. BSS offers a compact, language-agnostic representation of codebases to facilitate precise design pattern detection. ODR unifies artifact and solution representations to optimize code refactoring via heuristic algorithms while eliminating iterative computational overhead. By providing a structured approach to software design challenges, ASE lays the groundwork for future research in encoding and analyzing complex software metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The C...</summary><p>The Conference's autorization to submit a preprint was granted</p></details> |
| **[RECOVER: Toward Requirements Generation from Stakeholders' Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19552v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stakeholders' conversations in requirements elicitation meetings hold valuable insights into system and client needs. However, manually extracting requirements is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors and biases. While current state-of-the-art methods assist in summarizing stakeholder conversations and classifying requirements based on their nature, there is a noticeable lack of approaches capable of both identifying requirements within these conversations and generating corresponding system requirements. These approaches would assist requirement identification, reducing engineers' workload, time, and effort. To address this gap, this paper introduces RECOVER (Requirements EliCitation frOm conVERsations), a novel conversational requirements engineering approach that leverages natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) to support practitioners in automatically extracting system requirements from stakeholder interactions. The approach is evaluated using a mixed-method study that combines performance analysis with a user study involving requirements engineers, targeting two levels of granularity. First, at the conversation turn level, the evaluation measures RECOVER's accuracy in identifying requirements-relevant dialogue and the quality of generated requirements in terms of correctness, completeness, and actionability. Second, at the entire conversation level, the evaluation assesses the overall usefulness and effectiveness of RECOVER in synthesizing comprehensive system requirements from full stakeholder discussions. Empirical evaluation of RECOVER shows promising performance, with generated requirements demonstrating satisfactory correctness, completeness, and actionability. The results also highlight the potential of automating requirements elicitation from conversations as an aid that enhances efficiency while maintaining human oversight</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Verification Standards for Security Requirements Generation from Functional Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11857v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current software driven era, ensuring privacy and security is critical. Despite this, the specification of security requirements for software is still largely a manual and labor intensive process. Engineers are tasked with analyzing potential security threats based on functional requirements (FRs), a procedure prone to omissions and errors due to the expertise gap between cybersecurity experts and software engineers. To bridge this gap, we introduce F2SRD (Function to Security Requirements Derivation), an automated approach that proactively derives security requirements (SRs) from functional specifications under the guidance of relevant security verification requirements (VRs) drawn from the well recognized OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS). F2SRD operates in two main phases: Initially, we develop a VR retriever trained on a custom database of FR and VR pairs, enabling it to adeptly select applicable VRs from ASVS. This targeted retrieval informs the precise and actionable formulation of SRs. Subsequently, these VRs are used to construct structured prompts that direct GPT4 in generating SRs. Our comparative analysis against two established models demonstrates F2SRD's enhanced performance in producing SRs that excel in inspiration, diversity, and specificity essential attributes for effective security requirement generation. By leveraging security verification standards, we believe that the generated SRs are not only more focused but also resonate stronger with the needs of engineers.</p></details> | 23pages, FSE 2025 |

However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: \textit{maintainability}. To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose \textbf{MaintainCoder} as a pioneering solution. It integrates the Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, achieving clear responsibility boundaries and better maintainability. We also introduce \textbf{MaintainBench}, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and novel dynamic metrics on maintenance efforts. Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. In contrast, MaintainCoder improves dynamic maintainability metrics by more than 60\% with even higher correctness of initial codes. Furthermore, while static metrics fail to accurately reflect maintainability and even contradict each other, our proposed dynamic metrics exhibit high consistency. Our work not only provides the foundation for maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more realistic and comprehensive code generation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/MaintainCoder</p></details> |

However, the issue of security, particularly backdoor attacks, is often overlooked in this process. The previous research has focused on designing backdoor attacks for CLMs, but effective defenses have not been adequately addressed. In particular, existing defense methods from natural language processing, when directly applied to CLMs, are not effective enough and lack generality, working well in some models and scenarios but failing in others, thus fall short in consistently mitigating backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we first confirm the phenomenon of "early learning" as a general occurrence during the training of CLMs. This phenomenon refers to that a model initially focuses on the main features of training data but may become more sensitive to backdoor triggers over time, leading to overfitting and susceptibility to backdoor attacks. We then analyze that overfitting to backdoor triggers results from the use of the cross-entropy loss function, where the unboundedness of cross-entropy leads the model to increasingly concentrate on the features of the poisoned data. Based on this insight, we propose a general and effective loss function DeCE (Deceptive Cross-Entropy) by blending deceptive distributions and applying label smoothing to limit the gradient to bounded, which prevents the model from overfitting to backdoor triggers and then enhances the security of CLMs against backdoor attacks.</p></details> | TOSEM |

In some cases, warnings may be indicative of larger issues, but programmers may not understand how a seemingly unimportant warning can grow into a vulnerability. Because these messages tend to be long and confusing, programmers tend to ignore them if they do not cause readily identifiable issues. Large language models can simplify these warnings, explain the gravity of important warnings, and suggest potential fixes to increase developer compliance with fixing warnings.</p></details> |  |

This paper makes two technical contributions -- (i) FLOW-BENCH, a high quality dataset of paired natural language instructions and structured business process definitions to evaluate NL-based BPA tools, and support bourgeoning research in this area, and (ii) FLOW-GEN, our approach to utilize LLMs to translate natural language into an intermediate representation with Python syntax that facilitates final conversion into widely adopted business process definition languages, such as BPMN and DMN. We bootstrap FLOW-BENCH by demonstrating how it can be used to evaluate the components of FLOW-GEN across eight LLMs of varying sizes. We hope that FLOW-GEN and FLOW-BENCH catalyze further research in BPA making it more accessible to novice and expert users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Assembly Code Performance with Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code performance.</p></details> |  |

Although workflow management tools such as Snakemake and Nextflow enable users to automate the processing of samples within a single sequencing project, integrating many datasets in bulk requires launching and monitoring hundreds or thousands of pipelines. We present the Compendium Manager, a lightweight command-line tool to enable launching and monitoring analysis pipelines at scale.

Existing approaches primarily focus on syntactic correctness through synthetic micro-benchmarks or subjective human ratings, failing to address real-world requirements for semantic fidelity and analyst usability. We present DecompileBench, the first comprehensive framework that enables effective evaluation of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows through three key components: \textit{real-world function extraction} (comprising 23,400 functions from 130 real-world programs), \textit{runtime-aware validation}, and \textit{automated human-centric assessment} using LLM-as-Judge to quantify the effectiveness of decompilers in reverse engineering workflows. Through a systematic comparison between six industrial-strength decompilers and six recent LLM-powered approaches, we demonstrate that LLM-based methods surpass commercial tools in code understandability despite 52.2% lower functionality correctness. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based approaches to transform human-centric reverse engineering. We open source \href{https://github.com/Jennieett/DecompileBench}{DecompileBench} to provide a framework to advance research on decompilers and assist security experts in making informed tool selections based on their specific requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Online Computation of Business Process State From Trace Prefixes via N-Gram Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05658v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the following problem: Given a process model and an event log containing trace prefixes of ongoing cases of a process, map each case to its corresponding state (i.e., marking) in the model. This state computation operation is a building block of other process mining operations, such as log animation and short-term simulation. An approach to this state computation problem is to perform a token-based replay of each trace prefix against the model. However, when a trace prefix does not strictly follow the behavior of the process model, token replay may produce a state that is not reachable from the initial state of the process. An alternative approach is to first compute an alignment between the trace prefix of each ongoing case and the model, and then replay the aligned trace prefix. However, (prefix-)alignment is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a method that, given a trace prefix of an ongoing case, computes its state in constant time using an index that represents states as n-grams. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed approach has an accuracy comparable to that of the prefix-alignment approach, while achieving a throughput of hundreds of thousands of traces per second.</p></details> | <details><summary>Postp...</summary><p>Postprint version.

Given the high volume of issue reports in large-scale projects, manually assigning issues is tedious and costly. Previous studies have proposed automated issue assignment approaches that primarily focus on modeling issue report textual information, developers' expertise, or interactions between issues and developers based on historical issue-fixing records. However, these approaches often suffer from performance limitations due to the presence of incorrect and missing labels in OSS datasets, as well as the long tail of developer contributions and the changes of developer activity as the project evolves. To address these challenges, we propose IssueCourier, a novel Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network approach for issue assignment. Specifically, we formalize five key relationships among issues, developers, and source code files to construct a heterogeneous graph. Then, we further adopt a temporal slicing technique that partitions the graph into a sequence of time-based subgraphs to learn stage-specific patterns. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark dataset with relabeled ground truth to address the problem of incorrect and missing labels in existing OSS datasets. Finally, to evaluate the performance of IssueCourier, we conduct extensive experiments on our benchmark dataset. The results show that IssueCourier can improve over the best baseline up to 45.49% in top-1 and 31.97% in MRR.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

To bridge this gap, we present StRuCom - the first large-scale dataset (153K examples) specifically designed for Russian code documentation. Unlike machine-translated English datasets that distort terminology (e.g., technical loanwords vs. literal translations) and docstring structures, StRuCom combines human-written comments from Russian GitHub repositories with synthetically generated ones, ensuring compliance with Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Go standards through automated validation. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Coder models (0.5B-7B) on StRuCom shows statistically significant improvements of chrf++ and BERTScore over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy and Confidentiality Requirements Engineering for Process Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10965v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application and development of process mining techniques face significant challenges due to the lack of publicly available real-life event logs. One reason for companies to abstain from sharing their data are privacy and confidentiality concerns. Privacy concerns refer to personal data as specified in the GDPR and have been addressed in existing work by providing privacy-preserving techniques for event logs. However, the concept of confidentiality in event logs not pertaining to individuals remains unclear, although they might contain a multitude of sensitive business data. This work addresses confidentiality of process data based on the privacy and confidentiality engineering method (PCRE). PCRE interactively explores privacy and confidentiality requirements regarding process data with different stakeholders and defines privacy-preserving actions to address possible concerns. We co-construct and evaluate PCRE based on structured interviews with process analysts in two manufacturing companies. PCRE is generic, hence applicable in different application domains. The goal is to systematically scrutinize process data and balance the trade-off between privacy and utility loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let the Trial Begin: A Mock-Court Approach to Vulnerability Detection using LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10961v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting vulnerabilities in source code remains a critical yet challenging task, especially when benign and vulnerable functions share significant similarities. In this work, we introduce VulTrial, a courtroom-inspired multi-agent framework designed to enhance automated vulnerability detection. It employs four role-specific agents, which are security researcher, code author, moderator, and review board. Through extensive experiments using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o we demonstrate that Vultrial outperforms single-agent and multi-agent baselines. Using GPT-4o, VulTrial improves the performance by 102.39% and 84.17% over its respective baseline. Additionally, we show that role-specific instruction tuning in multi-agent with small data (50 pair samples) improves the performance of VulTrial further by 139.89% and 118.30%. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of increasing the number of agent interactions on VulTrial's overall performance. While multi-agent setups inherently incur higher costs due to increased token usage, our findings reveal that applying VulTrial to a cost-effective model like GPT-3.5 can improve its performance by 69.89% compared to GPT-4o in a single-agent setting, at a lower overall cost.</p></details> |  |

We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs. Building on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a structured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers practitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure Computer-Using Agents.</p></details> |  |

To combat this, machine learning-based (ML-based) malware detection (MD) systems have been developed. However, these systems have increasingly been attacked in recent years, undermining their effectiveness in practice. While the security risks associated with ML-based MD systems have garnered considerable attention, the majority of prior works is limited to adversarial malware examples, lacking a comprehensive analysis of practical security risks. This paper addresses this gap by utilizing the CIA principles to define the scope of security risks. We then deconstruct ML-based MD systems into distinct operational stages, thus developing a stage-based taxonomy. Utilizing this taxonomy, we summarize the technical progress and discuss the gaps in the attack and defense proposals related to the ML-based MD systems within each stage. Subsequently, we conduct two case studies, using both inter-stage and intra-stage analyses according to the stage-based taxonomy to provide new empirical insights. Based on these analyses and insights, we suggest potential future directions from both inter-stage and intra-stage perspectives.</p></details> |  |

Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models' performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training.</p></details> |  |

Constructing test scenarios for autonomous driving systems (ADSs), however, is labor-intensive. We propose TARGET, an end-to-end framework that automatically generates test scenarios from traffic rules. To address complexity, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract knowledge from traffic rules. To mitigate hallucinations caused by large context during input processing, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to be syntactically simple and compositional. This design allows the LLM to learn and generate test scenarios in a modular manner while enabling syntactic and semantic validation for each component. Based on these validated representations, TARGET synthesizes executable scripts to render scenarios in simulation. Evaluated seven ADSs with 284 scenarios derived from 54 traffic rules, TARGET uncovered 610 rule violations, collisions, and other issues. For each violation, TARGET generates scenario recordings and detailed logs, aiding root cause analysis. Two identified issues were confirmed by ADS developers: one linked to an existing bug report and the other to limited ADS functionality.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the transpilation of C code to idiomatic Rust, while ensuring that the generated code mitigates any memory-related vulnerabilities present in the original code. To that end, we present the design and implementation of SafeTrans, a framework that uses LLMs to i) transpile C code into Rust and ii) iteratively fix any compilation and runtime errors in the resulting code. A key novelty of our approach is the introduction of a few-shot guided repair technique for translation errors, which provides contextual information and example code snippets for specific error types, guiding the LLM toward the correct solution. Another novel aspect of our work is the evaluation of the security implications of the transpilation process, i.e., whether potential vulnerabilities in the original C code have been properly addressed in the translated Rust code. We experimentally evaluated SafeTrans with six leading LLMs and a set of 2,653 C programs accompanied by comprehensive unit tests, which were used for validating the correctness of the translated code. Our results show that our iterative repair strategy improves the rate of successful translations from 54% to 80% for the best-performing LLM (GPT-4o), and that all types of identified vulnerabilities in the original C code are effectively mitigated in the translated Rust code.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has focused on detecting IaC issues, Automated Program Repair (APR) remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of suitable specifications. In this work, we propose InfraFix, the first technology-agnostic framework for repairing IaC scripts. Unlike prior approaches, InfraFix allows APR techniques to be guided by diverse information sources. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach for generating repair scenarios, enabling large-scale evaluation of APR techniques for IaC.

| **[Using Cooperative Co-evolutionary Search to Generate Metamorphic Test Cases for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03843v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) rely on Deep Neural Networks, allowing vehicles to navigate complex, open environments. However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 16 figures, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (2025)</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/SceneGenAgent .</p></details> |  |

Although many tools generate UML diagrams from UML code, generating executable UML code from image-based UML diagrams remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach to generate UML code using a large multimodal language model automatically. Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models. The experiments measured code generation accuracy across different model sizes and training strategies. These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams. This will enable the modernization of legacy systems and decrease the manual effort in software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Journal of Machine Learning with Applications, Author Contributions: Averi Bates: Methodology, Development, Analysis, Data Curation, Drafting, Review.

While platform evolution and smart contracts' inherent immutability necessitate migrations both across and within chains, migrating the vast amounts of critical data in these contracts while maintaining data integrity and minimizing operational disruption presents a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we present SmartShift, a framework that enables secure and efficient smart contract migrations through intelligent state partitioning and progressive function activation, preserving operational continuity during transitions. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartShift significantly reduces migration downtime while ensuring robust security, establishing a foundation for efficient and secure smart contract migration systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Robust in Understanding Code Against Semantics-Preserving Mutations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10443v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Repetition Problems of LLMs in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10402v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |
| **[Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful for Java Function Bug Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10375v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, managing the configuration differences between these two environments can be challenging, leading to inconsistent behavior, unexpected errors, and increased downtime. Objective: In this study, we sought to investigate the strategies software companies employ to mitigate the configuration differences between the development and production environments. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these strategies used to contribute to reducing the risk of configuration-related issues. Method: To achieve this goal, we interviewed 17 participants and leveraged the Thematic Analysis methodology to analyze the interview data. These participants shed some light on the current practices, processes, challenges, or issues they have encountered. Results: Based on the interviews, we systematically formulated and structured a catalog of eight strategies that explain how software producing companies mitigate these configuration differences. These strategies vary from 1) creating detailed configuration management plans, 2) using automation tools, and 3) developing processes to test and validate changes through containers and virtualization technologies. Conclusion: By implementing these strategies, companies can improve their ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the production environment. In addition, they can also ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on the environmental craze on social media platforms and its impact on young activists aged 16-25. With the advancement of social media, new avenues have opened for participation in sustainability issues, especially for the marginalized, as information moved through transnational networks at lightning speed. Along with specific Formative Visual Storytelling methods, the young leaders of the movement deploy hashtags and other online tools to capture the attention of their peers and decision makers. Challenges persist with "clicktivism" fatigue from the internet, and site limitations. This article contributes to insights on emerging forms of civic activism by explaining how digital natives adapt technology to reframe green activism. The research suggests that effective digital environmental movements integrate online and offline action, make it simple for individuals to get involved, and promote tolerance to algorithmic modifications and climate care among participants.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Building upon existing system-1 models, CRPE addresses the fundamental challenge of enhancing LLMs' analytical and logical processing in code generation tasks. Our framework presents a methodologically rigorous yet implementable approach to cultivating advanced code reasoning abilities in language models. Through the implementation of CRPE, we successfully develop an enhanced COT-Coder that demonstrates marked improvements in code generation tasks. Evaluation results on LiveCodeBench (20240701-20240901) demonstrate that our COT-Coder-7B-StepDPO, derived from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base, with a pass@1 accuracy of 21.88, exceeds all models with similar or even larger sizes. Furthermore, our COT-Coder-32B-StepDPO, based on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Base, exhibits superior performance with a pass@1 accuracy of 35.08, outperforming GPT4O on the benchmark. Overall, CRPE represents a comprehensive, open-source method that encompasses the complete pipeline from instruction data acquisition through expert code reasoning data synthesis, culminating in an autonomous reasoning enhancement mechanism.</p></details> |  |

A case study of LLM-driven configuration code generation for automotive simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13263v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are taking many industries by storm. They possess impressive reasoning capabilities and are capable of handling complex problems, as shown by their steadily improving scores on coding and mathematical benchmarks. However, are the models currently available truly capable of addressing real-world challenges, such as those found in the automotive industry? How well can they understand high-level, abstract instructions? Can they translate these instructions directly into functional code, or do they still need help and supervision? In this work, we put one of the current state-of-the-art models to the test. We evaluate its performance in the task of translating abstract requirements, extracted from automotive standards and documents, into configuration code for CARLA simulations.</p></details> |  |

Parf models various types of external parameters (encoding abstraction strategies) as random variables subject to probability distributions over latticed parameter spaces. It incrementally refines the probability distributions based on accumulated intermediate results generated by repeatedly sampling and analyzing, thereby ultimately yielding a set of highly accurate abstraction strategies. Parf is implemented on top of Frama-C/Eva - an off-the-shelf open-source static analyzer for C programs. Parf provides a web-based user interface facilitating the intuitive configuration of static analyzers and visualization of dynamic distribution refinement of the abstraction strategies. It further supports the identification of dominant parameters in Frama-C/Eva analysis. Benchmark experiments and a case study demonstrate the competitive performance of Parf for analyzing complex, large-scale real-world programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Retrieval Augmented Generation for Object Constraint Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13129v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is essential for defining precise constraints within Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). However, manually writing OCL rules is complex and time-consuming. This study explores the optimization of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for automating OCL rule generation, focusing on the impact of different retrieval strategies. We evaluate three retrieval approaches $\unicode{x2013}$ BM25 (lexical-based), BERT-based (semantic retrieval), and SPLADE (sparse-vector retrieval) $\unicode{x2013}$ analyzing their effectiveness in providing relevant context for a large language model. To further assess our approach, we compare and benchmark our retrieval-optimized generation results against PathOCL, a state-of-the-art graph-based method. We directly compare BM25, BERT, and SPLADE retrieval methods with PathOCL to understand how different retrieval methods perform for a unified evaluation framework. Our experimental results, focusing on retrieval-augmented generation, indicate that while retrieval can enhance generation accuracy, its effectiveness depends on the retrieval method and the number of retrieved chunks (k). BM25 underperforms the baseline, whereas semantic approaches (BERT and SPLADE) achieve better results, with SPLADE performing best at lower k values. However, excessive retrieval with high k parameter can lead to retrieving irrelevant chunks which degrades model performance. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing retrieval configurations to balance context relevance and output consistency. This research provides insights into improving OCL rule generation using RAG and underscores the need for tailoring retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing 7,400 Bugs for 1$: Cheap Crash-Site Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13103v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of bug-finding techniques has led to the discovery of more vulnerabilities than developers can reasonably fix, creating an urgent need for effective Automated Program Repair (APR) methods. However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We present a multicore SystemC-TLM-based CPU model that can be used as a drop-in replacement for an instruction-set simulator. It places no special requirements on the host system, making it compatible with various environments. Benchmark results show that our ARM-on-ARM-based virtual platform achieves up to 10 x speedup over traditional instruction-set-simulator-based models on compute-intensive workloads.

However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

To adopt CI/CD, software developers need to configure their projects using dedicated YML configuration files. Mobile apps have distinct characteristics with respect to CI/CD practices, such as testing on various emulators and deploying to app stores. However, little is known about the challenges and added value of adopting CI/CD in mobile apps and how developers maintain such a practice. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on CI/CD practices in 2,557 Android apps adopting four popular CI/CD services, namely GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. We also compare our findings with those reported in prior research on general CI/CD practices to situate them within broader trends. We observe a lack of commonality and standardization across CI/CD services and Android apps, leading to complex YML configurations and associated maintenance efforts. We also observe that CI/CD configurations focus primarily on the build setup, with around half of the projects performing standard testing and only 9% incorporating deployment. In addition, we find that CI/CD configurations are changed bi-monthly on average, with frequent maintenance correlating with active issue tracking, project size/age, and community engagement. Our qualitative analysis of commits uncovered 11 themes in CI/CD maintenance activities, with over a third of the changes focusing on improving workflows and fixing build issues, whereas another third involves updating the build environment, tools, and dependencies. Our study emphasizes the necessity for automation and AI-powered tools to improve CI/CD processes for mobile apps and advocates creating adaptable open-source tools to efficiently manage resources, especially in testing and deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench) comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework integrates both question generation and answer verification components to enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to domain-specific code translation.</p></details> |  |

However, few techniques are available to support automatic and systematic testing for access-control changes and detecting risky changes to prevent severe consequences. As a result, those critical security configurations often lack testing, or are tested manually in an ad hoc way. This paper advocates that tests should be made available for users to test access-control configuration changes. The key challenges are such tests need to be run with production environments (to reason end-to-end behavior) and need to be performance-efficient. We present a new approach to create such tests, as a mini test environment incorporating production program and data, called ACtests. ACtests report the impacts of access-control changes, namely the requests that were denied but would be allowed after a change, and vice versa. Users can validate if the changed requests are intended or not and identify potential security vulnerabilities. We evaluate ACtests with 193 public configurations of widely-used web applications on Dockerhub. ACtests detect 168 new vulnerabilities from 72 configuration images. We report them to the image maintainers: 54 of them have been confirmed and 44 have been fixed. We also conduct in-depth experiments with five real-world deployed systems, including Wikipedia and a commercial company's web proxy. Our results show that ACtests effectively and efficiently detect all the change impacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Automated Blackbox Noncompliance Checker for QUIC Server Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12690v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop QUICtester, an automated approach for uncovering non-compliant behaviors in the ratified QUIC protocol implementations (RFC 9000/9001). QUICtester leverages active automata learning to abstract the behavior of a QUIC implementation into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. Unlike prior noncompliance checking methods, to help uncover state dependencies on event timing, QUICtester introduces the idea of state learning with event timing variations, adopting both valid and invalid input configurations, and combinations of security and transport layer parameters during learning. We use pairwise differential analysis of learned behaviour models of tested QUIC implementations to identify non-compliance instances as behaviour deviations in a property-agnostic way. This exploits the existence of the many different QUIC implementations, removing the need for validated, formal models. The diverse implementations act as cross-checking test oracles to discover non-compliance. We used QUICtester to analyze analyze 186 learned models from 19 QUIC implementations under the five security settings and discovered 55 implementation errors. Significantly, the tool uncovered a QUIC specification ambiguity resulting in an easily exploitable DoS vulnerability, led to 5 CVE assignments from developers, and two bug bounties thus far.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASIA CCS 2025.

Though widely used, they may also be wildly misleading. Causal structures generated from SE data can be highly variable. This instability is so significant that conclusions drawn from one graph may be totally reversed in another, even when both graphs are learned from the same or very similar project data. To document this problem, this paper examines causal graphs found by four causal graph generators (PC, FCI, GES, and LiNGAM) when applied to 23 data sets, relating to three different SE tasks: (a) learning how configuration options are selected for different properties; (b) understanding how management choices affect software projects; and (c) defect prediction. Graphs were compared between (a) different projects exploring the same task; (b) version i and i + 1 of a system; (c) different 90% samples of the data; and (d) small variations in the causal graph generator. Measured in terms of the Jaccard index of the number of edges shared by two different graphs, over half the edges were changed by these treatments. Hence, we conclude two things. Firstly, specific conclusions found by causal graph generators about how two specific variables affect each other may not generalize since those conclusions could be reversed by minor changes in how those graphs are generated. Secondly, before researchers can report supposedly general conclusions from causal graphs (e.g., "long functions cause more defects"), they should test that such conclusions hold over the numerous causal graphs that might be generated from the same data.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables, submitted to EMSE</p></details> |

The environment combines the flexibility, determinism, and observability of software-only simulation with the fidelity and depth normally attained only by real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing. Ultimately, this work enables an engineering process in which flight software is continuously improved and delivered in its final, flight-ready form, and which reduces the cost of design changes and software revisions with respect to a traditional linear development process. Three key methods not found in existing tools enable this environment's novel capabilities: first, a hybrid event-driven simulation architecture that combines continuous-time and discrete-event simulation paradigms; second, a lightweight application-layer software virtualization design that allows executing compiled flight software binaries while modeling process scheduling, input/output, and memory use; and third, high-fidelity models for the multi-spacecraft space environment, including for wireless communication, relative sensing such as differential GPS and cameras, and flight computer health metrics like heap exhaustion and fragmentation. The simulation environment's capabilities are applied to the iterative development and testing of two flight-ready software packages: the guidance, navigation, and control software for the VISORS mission, and the Stanford Space Rendezvous Laboratory software kit for rendezvous and proximity operations. Results from 33 months of flight software development demonstrate the use of this simulation environment to rapidly and reliably identify and resolve defects, characterize navigation and control performance, and scrutinize implementation details like memory allocation and inter-spacecraft network protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025</p></details> |

These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification, showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops by more than 20%. We then demonstrate that simply adding more requirements to a prompt does not reliably improve performance, due to LLMs' limited instruction-following capabilities and competing constraints, and standard prompt optimizers do not offer much help. To address this, we introduce novel requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that can improve performance by 4.8% on average over baselines that naively specify everything in the prompt. Beyond prompt optimization, we envision that effectively managing prompt underspecification requires a broader process, including proactive requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability. Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval) and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall. Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity, potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context information.</p></details> |  |

Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on code generation and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MigrationBench with a distinct focus: code migration. MigrationBench aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java $8$ to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java $17$, $21$), including a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java $17$. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves $62.33\%$ and $27.33\%$ success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively.

They possess impressive reasoning capabilities and are capable of handling complex problems, as shown by their steadily improving scores on coding and mathematical benchmarks. However, are the models currently available truly capable of addressing real-world challenges, such as those found in the automotive industry? How well can they understand high-level, abstract instructions? Can they translate these instructions directly into functional code, or do they still need help and supervision? In this work, we put one of the current state-of-the-art models to the test.

However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |

However, in practical applications, there remains a gap between current commonly used code completion evaluation metrics and users' actual perception. To address this issue, we propose two evaluation metrics for code completion tasks--LCP and ROUGE-LCP, from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of effective structural semantic modeling and cross-module dependency information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and Semantically-Reordered Code Graph (SPSR-Graph). Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed evaluation metrics in terms of user perception consistency, as well as the effectiveness of the data processing method in enhancing model performance.</p></details> | 14 pages,8 figures |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench) comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework integrates both question generation and answer verification components to enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to domain-specific code translation.</p></details> |  |

SubmitQueue, a system designed to address these challenges, speculatively executes builds and only lands changes with successful outcomes. However, despite its effectiveness, the system faces inefficiencies in resource utilization, leading to a high rate of premature build aborts and delays in landing smaller changes blocked by larger conflicting ones. This paper introduces enhancements to SubmitQueue, focusing on optimizing resource usage and improving build prioritization. Central to this is our innovative probabilistic model, which distinguishes between changes with shorter and longer build times to prioritize builds for more efficient scheduling. By leveraging a machine learning model to predict build times and incorporating this into the probabilistic framework, we expedite the landing of smaller changes blocked by conflicting larger time-consuming changes. Additionally, introducing a concept of speculation threshold ensures that only the most likely builds are executed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption. After implementing these enhancements across Uber's major monorepos (Go, iOS, and Android), we observed a reduction in Continuous Integration (CI) resource usage by approximately 53%, CPU usage by 44%, and P95 waiting times by 37%. These improvements highlight the enhanced efficiency of SubmitQueue in managing large-scale software changes while maintaining a green mainline.</p></details> |  |

Finally, our findings indicate that current code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity, potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context information.</p></details> |  |
| **[MigrationBench: Repository-Level Code Migration Benchmark from Java 8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09569v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of powerful large language models (LLMs) in recent years, a wide range of software engineering tasks can now be addressed using LLMs, significantly enhancing productivity and scalability. Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on code generation and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MigrationBench with a distinct focus: code migration. MigrationBench aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java $8$ to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java $17$, $21$), including a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java $17$. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves $62.33\%$ and $27.33\%$ success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience/migrationbench-68125452fc21a4564b92b6c3 and https://github.com/amazon-science/MigrationBench respectively.</p></details> |  |

A case study of LLM-driven configuration code generation for automotive simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13263v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are taking many industries by storm. They possess impressive reasoning capabilities and are capable of handling complex problems, as shown by their steadily improving scores on coding and mathematical benchmarks. However, are the models currently available truly capable of addressing real-world challenges, such as those found in the automotive industry? How well can they understand high-level, abstract instructions? Can they translate these instructions directly into functional code, or do they still need help and supervision? In this work, we put one of the current state-of-the-art models to the test. We evaluate its performance in the task of translating abstract requirements, extracted from automotive standards and documents, into configuration code for CARLA simulations.</p></details> |  |

Parf models various types of external parameters (encoding abstraction strategies) as random variables subject to probability distributions over latticed parameter spaces. It incrementally refines the probability distributions based on accumulated intermediate results generated by repeatedly sampling and analyzing, thereby ultimately yielding a set of highly accurate abstraction strategies. Parf is implemented on top of Frama-C/Eva - an off-the-shelf open-source static analyzer for C programs. Parf provides a web-based user interface facilitating the intuitive configuration of static analyzers and visualization of dynamic distribution refinement of the abstraction strategies. It further supports the identification of dominant parameters in Frama-C/Eva analysis. Benchmark experiments and a case study demonstrate the competitive performance of Parf for analyzing complex, large-scale real-world programs.</p></details> |  |

Building upon the pre-existing, yet rudimentary CASTLE scheme, Prink for the first time introduces semantics-aware ks-anonymization of non-numerical (such as categorical or hierarchically generalizable) streaming data in a information loss-optimized manner. In addition, it provides native integration into Apache Flink, one of the prevailing frameworks for enterprise-grade stream data processing in numerous application domains. Our contributions excel the previously established state of the art for the privacy guarantee-providing anonymization of streaming data in that they 1) allow to include non-numerical data in the anonymization process, 2) provide discrete datapoints instead of aggregates, thereby facilitating flexible data use, 3) are applicable in real-world system contexts with minimal integration efforts, and 4) are experimentally proven to raise acceptable performance overheads and information loss in realistic settings. With these characteristics, Prink provides an anonymization approach which is practically feasible for a broad variety of real-world, enterprise-grade stream processing applications and environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for ARES 2025</p></details> |
| **[Aspects of complexity in automotive software systems and their relation to maintainability effort. A case study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13135v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Large embedded systems in vehicles tend to grow in size and complexity, which causes challenges when maintaining these systems. Objective: We explore how developers perceive the relation between maintainability effort and various sources of complexity. Methods: We conduct a case study at Scania AB, a heavy vehicle OEM. The units of analysis are two large software systems and their development teams/organizations. Results: Our results show that maintainability effort is driven by system internal complexity in the form of variant management and complex hardware control tasks. The maintainability is also influenced by emergent complexity caused by the system's longevity and constant growth. Besides these system-internal complexities, maintainability effort is also influenced by external complexities, such as organizational coordination and business needs. During the study, developer trade-off strategies for minimizing maintainability effort emerged. Conclusions: Complexity is a good proxy of maintainability effort, and allows developers to create strategies for managing the maintainability effort. Adequate complexity metrics include both external aspects -- e.g., coordination complexity -- and internal ones -- e.g., McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Retrieval Augmented Generation for Object Constraint Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13129v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is essential for defining precise constraints within Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). However, manually writing OCL rules is complex and time-consuming. This study explores the optimization of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for automating OCL rule generation, focusing on the impact of different retrieval strategies. We evaluate three retrieval approaches $\unicode{x2013}$ BM25 (lexical-based), BERT-based (semantic retrieval), and SPLADE (sparse-vector retrieval) $\unicode{x2013}$ analyzing their effectiveness in providing relevant context for a large language model. To further assess our approach, we compare and benchmark our retrieval-optimized generation results against PathOCL, a state-of-the-art graph-based method. We directly compare BM25, BERT, and SPLADE retrieval methods with PathOCL to understand how different retrieval methods perform for a unified evaluation framework. Our experimental results, focusing on retrieval-augmented generation, indicate that while retrieval can enhance generation accuracy, its effectiveness depends on the retrieval method and the number of retrieved chunks (k). BM25 underperforms the baseline, whereas semantic approaches (BERT and SPLADE) achieve better results, with SPLADE performing best at lower k values. However, excessive retrieval with high k parameter can lead to retrieving irrelevant chunks which degrades model performance. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing retrieval configurations to balance context relevance and output consistency. This research provides insights into improving OCL rule generation using RAG and underscores the need for tailoring retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Hierarchical Self-Distillation Enhances Early Layer Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03008v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying language models often requires navigating accuracy vs. performance trade-offs to meet latency constraints while preserving utility. Traditional model distillation reduces size but incurs substantial costs through training separate models. We introduce ModularStarEncoder (MoSE), a 1-billion-parameter multi-exit encoder for code retrieval and classification that employs a novel Self-Distillation mechanism. This approach significantly enhances lower-layer representations, enabling flexible deployment of different model portions with favorable performance trade-offs. Our architecture improves text-to-code and code-to-code search by targeting specific encoder layers as exit heads, where higher layers guide earlier ones during training-improving intermediate representations at minimal additional cost. We further enhance MoSE with a repository-level contextual loss that maximizes training context window utilization. Additionally, we release a new dataset created through code translation that extends text-to-code benchmarks with cross-language code-to-code pairs. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Self-Distillation as a principled approach to trading inference cost for accuracy across various code understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |

However, in practical applications, there remains a gap between current commonly used code completion evaluation metrics and users' actual perception. To address this issue, we propose two evaluation metrics for code completion tasks--LCP and ROUGE-LCP, from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of effective structural semantic modeling and cross-module dependency information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and Semantically-Reordered Code Graph (SPSR-Graph). Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed evaluation metrics in terms of user perception consistency, as well as the effectiveness of the data processing method in enhancing model performance.</p></details> | 14 pages,8 figures |

| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel approach to ARM-on-ARM virtualization within SystemC-based simulators using Linux's KVM to achieve high-performance simulation. By running target software natively on ARM-based hosts with hardware-based virtualization extensions, our method eliminates the need for instruction-set simulators, which significantly improves performance. We present a multicore SystemC-TLM-based CPU model that can be used as a drop-in replacement for an instruction-set simulator. It places no special requirements on the host system, making it compatible with various environments. Benchmark results show that our ARM-on-ARM-based virtual platform achieves up to 10 x speedup over traditional instruction-set-simulator-based models on compute-intensive workloads. Depending on the benchmark, speedups increase to more than 100 x.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference 2025 (DATE '25)</p></details> |
| **[CPRet: A Dataset, Benchmark, and Model for Retrieval in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12925v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

To adopt CI/CD, software developers need to configure their projects using dedicated YML configuration files. Mobile apps have distinct characteristics with respect to CI/CD practices, such as testing on various emulators and deploying to app stores. However, little is known about the challenges and added value of adopting CI/CD in mobile apps and how developers maintain such a practice. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on CI/CD practices in 2,557 Android apps adopting four popular CI/CD services, namely GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. We also compare our findings with those reported in prior research on general CI/CD practices to situate them within broader trends. We observe a lack of commonality and standardization across CI/CD services and Android apps, leading to complex YML configurations and associated maintenance efforts. We also observe that CI/CD configurations focus primarily on the build setup, with around half of the projects performing standard testing and only 9% incorporating deployment. In addition, we find that CI/CD configurations are changed bi-monthly on average, with frequent maintenance correlating with active issue tracking, project size/age, and community engagement. Our qualitative analysis of commits uncovered 11 themes in CI/CD maintenance activities, with over a third of the changes focusing on improving workflows and fixing build issues, whereas another third involves updating the build environment, tools, and dependencies. Our study emphasizes the necessity for automation and AI-powered tools to improve CI/CD processes for mobile apps and advocates creating adaptable open-source tools to efficiently manage resources, especially in testing and deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench) comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework integrates both question generation and answer verification components to enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to domain-specific code translation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Testing Access-Control Configuration Changes for Web Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12770v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Access-control misconfigurations are among the main causes of today's data breaches in web applications. However, few techniques are available to support automatic and systematic testing for access-control changes and detecting risky changes to prevent severe consequences. As a result, those critical security configurations often lack testing, or are tested manually in an ad hoc way. This paper advocates that tests should be made available for users to test access-control configuration changes. The key challenges are such tests need to be run with production environments (to reason end-to-end behavior) and need to be performance-efficient. We present a new approach to create such tests, as a mini test environment incorporating production program and data, called ACtests. ACtests report the impacts of access-control changes, namely the requests that were denied but would be allowed after a change, and vice versa. Users can validate if the changed requests are intended or not and identify potential security vulnerabilities. We evaluate ACtests with 193 public configurations of widely-used web applications on Dockerhub. ACtests detect 168 new vulnerabilities from 72 configuration images. We report them to the image maintainers: 54 of them have been confirmed and 44 have been fixed. We also conduct in-depth experiments with five real-world deployed systems, including Wikipedia and a commercial company's web proxy. Our results show that ACtests effectively and efficiently detect all the change impacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02355v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation. Implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Code-5970/ .</p></details> |  |

QUICtester leverages active automata learning to abstract the behavior of a QUIC implementation into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. Unlike prior noncompliance checking methods, to help uncover state dependencies on event timing, QUICtester introduces the idea of state learning with event timing variations, adopting both valid and invalid input configurations, and combinations of security and transport layer parameters during learning. We use pairwise differential analysis of learned behaviour models of tested QUIC implementations to identify non-compliance instances as behaviour deviations in a property-agnostic way. This exploits the existence of the many different QUIC implementations, removing the need for validated, formal models. The diverse implementations act as cross-checking test oracles to discover non-compliance. We used QUICtester to analyze analyze 186 learned models from 19 QUIC implementations under the five security settings and discovered 55 implementation errors. Significantly, the tool uncovered a QUIC specification ambiguity resulting in an easily exploitable DoS vulnerability, led to 5 CVE assignments from developers, and two bug bounties thus far.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASIA CCS 2025.

| **[Understanding and Detecting Peer Dependency Resolving Loop in npm Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12676v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the default package manager for Node.js, npm has become one of the largest package management systems in the world. To facilitate dependency management for developers, npm supports a special type of dependency, Peer Dependency, whose installation and usage differ from regular dependencies. However, conflicts between peer dependencies can trap the npm client into infinite loops, leading to resource exhaustion and system crashes. We name this problem PeerSpin. Although PeerSpin poses a severe risk to ecosystems, it was overlooked by previous studies, and its impacts have not been explored. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts the first in-depth study to understand and detect PeerSpin in the npm ecosystem. First, by systematically analyzing the npm dependency resolution, we identify the root cause of PeerSpin and characterize two peer dependency patterns to guide detection. Second, we propose a novel technique called Node-Replacement-Conflict based PeerSpin Detection, which leverages the state of the directory tree during dependency resolution to achieve accurate and efficient PeerSpin detection. Based on this technique, we developed a tool called PeerChecker to detect PeerSpin. Finally, we apply PeerChecker to the entire NPM ecosystem and find that 5,662 packages, totaling 72,968 versions, suffer from PeerSpin. Up until now, we confirmed 28 real PeerSpin problems by reporting them to the package maintainer. We also open source all PeerSpin analysis implementations, tools, and data sets to the public to help the community detect PeerSpin issues and enhance the reliability of the npm ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLM decompilation technology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Decompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmark Decompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues. We further explore commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide a thorough assessment of the studied LLM decompilers and find that fine-tuning with Decompile-Bench causes a 20% improvement over previous benchmarks in terms of the re-executability rate. Our code and data has been released in HuggingFace and Github. https://github.com/albertan017/LLM4Decompile</p></details> |  |

Though widely used, they may also be wildly misleading. Causal structures generated from SE data can be highly variable. This instability is so significant that conclusions drawn from one graph may be totally reversed in another, even when both graphs are learned from the same or very similar project data. To document this problem, this paper examines causal graphs found by four causal graph generators (PC, FCI, GES, and LiNGAM) when applied to 23 data sets, relating to three different SE tasks: (a) learning how configuration options are selected for different properties; (b) understanding how management choices affect software projects; and (c) defect prediction. Graphs were compared between (a) different projects exploring the same task; (b) version i and i + 1 of a system; (c) different 90% samples of the data; and (d) small variations in the causal graph generator. Measured in terms of the Jaccard index of the number of edges shared by two different graphs, over half the edges were changed by these treatments. Hence, we conclude two things. Firstly, specific conclusions found by causal graph generators about how two specific variables affect each other may not generalize since those conclusions could be reversed by minor changes in how those graphs are generated. Secondly, before researchers can report supposedly general conclusions from causal graphs (e.g., "long functions cause more defects"), they should test that such conclusions hold over the numerous causal graphs that might be generated from the same data.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables, submitted to EMSE</p></details> |
| **[How Do OSS Developers Reuse Architectural Solutions from Q&A Sites: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05041v4)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers reuse programming-related knowledge on Q&A sites that functionally matches the programming problems they encounter in their development. Despite extensive research on Q&A sites, being a high-level and important type of development-related knowledge, architectural solutions and their reuse are rarely explored. To fill this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study that includes a mining study and a survey study. For the mining study, we mined 984 commits and issues from 893 OSS projects on GitHub that explicitly referenced architectural solutions from SO and SWESE. For the survey study, we identified practitioners involved in the reuse of these architectural solutions and surveyed 227 of them to further understand how practitioners reuse architectural solutions from Q&A sites in their OSS development. Our findings: (1) OSS practitioners use architectural solutions from Q&A sites to solve a large variety of architectural problems, wherein Component design issue, Architectural anti-pattern, and Security issue are dominant; (2) Seven categories of architectural solutions from Q&A sites have been reused to solve those problems, among which Architectural refactoring, Use of frameworks, and Architectural tactic are the three most reused architectural solutions; (3) OSS developers often rely on ad hoc ways (e.g., informal, improvised, or unstructured approaches) to incorporate architectural solutions from SO, drawing on personal experience and intuition rather than standardized or systematic practices; (4) Using architectural solutions from SO comes with a variety of challenges, e.g., OSS practitioners complain that they need to spend significant time to adapt such architectural solutions to address design concerns raised in their OSS development, and it is challenging to use architectural solutions that are not tailored to the design context of their OSS projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 2025</p></details> |

The environment combines the flexibility, determinism, and observability of software-only simulation with the fidelity and depth normally attained only by real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing. Ultimately, this work enables an engineering process in which flight software is continuously improved and delivered in its final, flight-ready form, and which reduces the cost of design changes and software revisions with respect to a traditional linear development process. Three key methods not found in existing tools enable this environment's novel capabilities: first, a hybrid event-driven simulation architecture that combines continuous-time and discrete-event simulation paradigms; second, a lightweight application-layer software virtualization design that allows executing compiled flight software binaries while modeling process scheduling, input/output, and memory use; and third, high-fidelity models for the multi-spacecraft space environment, including for wireless communication, relative sensing such as differential GPS and cameras, and flight computer health metrics like heap exhaustion and fragmentation. The simulation environment's capabilities are applied to the iterative development and testing of two flight-ready software packages: the guidance, navigation, and control software for the VISORS mission, and the Stanford Space Rendezvous Laboratory software kit for rendezvous and proximity operations. Results from 33 months of flight software development demonstrate the use of this simulation environment to rapidly and reliably identify and resolve defects, characterize navigation and control performance, and scrutinize implementation details like memory allocation and inter-spacecraft network protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects, EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based software testing baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity, targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and resilient test suites.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

SubmitQueue, a system designed to address these challenges, speculatively executes builds and only lands changes with successful outcomes. However, despite its effectiveness, the system faces inefficiencies in resource utilization, leading to a high rate of premature build aborts and delays in landing smaller changes blocked by larger conflicting ones. This paper introduces enhancements to SubmitQueue, focusing on optimizing resource usage and improving build prioritization. Central to this is our innovative probabilistic model, which distinguishes between changes with shorter and longer build times to prioritize builds for more efficient scheduling. By leveraging a machine learning model to predict build times and incorporating this into the probabilistic framework, we expedite the landing of smaller changes blocked by conflicting larger time-consuming changes. Additionally, introducing a concept of speculation threshold ensures that only the most likely builds are executed, reducing unnecessary resource consumption. After implementing these enhancements across Uber's major monorepos (Go, iOS, and Android), we observed a reduction in Continuous Integration (CI) resource usage by approximately 53%, CPU usage by 44%, and P95 waiting times by 37%. These improvements highlight the enhanced efficiency of SubmitQueue in managing large-scale software changes while maintaining a green mainline.</p></details> |  |

These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sense and Sensitivity: Examining the Influence of Semantic Recall on Long Context Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13353v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability. Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval) and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall. Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity, potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context information.</p></details> |  |

Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on code generation and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MigrationBench with a distinct focus: code migration. MigrationBench aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java $8$ to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java $17$, $21$), including a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java $17$. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves $62.33\%$ and $27.33\%$ success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively.

Traditional model distillation reduces size but incurs substantial costs through training separate models. We introduce ModularStarEncoder (MoSE), a 1-billion-parameter multi-exit encoder for code retrieval and classification that employs a novel Self-Distillation mechanism. This approach significantly enhances lower-layer representations, enabling flexible deployment of different model portions with favorable performance trade-offs. Our architecture improves text-to-code and code-to-code search by targeting specific encoder layers as exit heads, where higher layers guide earlier ones during training-improving intermediate representations at minimal additional cost. We further enhance MoSE with a repository-level contextual loss that maximizes training context window utilization. Additionally, we release a new dataset created through code translation that extends text-to-code benchmarks with cross-language code-to-code pairs. Evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Self-Distillation as a principled approach to trading inference cost for accuracy across various code understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, in practical applications, there remains a gap between current commonly used code completion evaluation metrics and users' actual perception. To address this issue, we propose two evaluation metrics for code completion tasks--LCP and ROUGE-LCP, from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of effective structural semantic modeling and cross-module dependency information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and Semantically-Reordered Code Graph (SPSR-Graph). Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed evaluation metrics in terms of user perception consistency, as well as the effectiveness of the data processing method in enhancing model performance.</p></details> | 14 pages,8 figures |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPRet: A Dataset, Benchmark, and Model for Retrieval in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12925v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

However, there remains a lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench) comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework integrates both question generation and answer verification components to enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to domain-specific code translation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification, showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops by more than 20%. We then demonstrate that simply adding more requirements to a prompt does not reliably improve performance, due to LLMs' limited instruction-following capabilities and competing constraints, and standard prompt optimizers do not offer much help. To address this, we introduce novel requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that can improve performance by 4.8% on average over baselines that naively specify everything in the prompt. Beyond prompt optimization, we envision that effectively managing prompt underspecification requires a broader process, including proactive requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring.</p></details> |  |
