| **[LLMs and Stack Overflow Discussions: Reliability, Impact, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08801v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.</p></details> | 63 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17125v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization of sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal compliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reassessing Code Authorship Attribution in the Era of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17120v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of Code Stylometry, and in particular Code Authorship Attribution (CAA), aims to analyze coding styles to identify the authors of code samples. CAA is crucial in cybersecurity and software forensics for addressing, detecting plagiarism, and supporting criminal prosecutions. However, CAA is a complex and error prone task, due to the need for recognizing nuanced relationships between coding patterns. This challenge is compounded in large software systems with numerous authors due to the subtle variability of patterns that signify the coding style of one author among many. Given the challenges related to this task, researchers have proposed and studied automated approaches that rely upon classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. However, such techniques have historically relied upon hand-crafted features, and due to the often intricate interaction of different features (e.g., formatting, etc.), have key limitations in properly characterizing authorship, and are sensitive to adversarial code perturbations. Recently, transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have shown remarkable efficacy across a range of software engineering tasks, and in the authorship attribution on natural language in the NLP domain. However, their effectiveness in CAA is not well understood. As such, we conduct the first extensive empirical study applying two larger state-of-the-art code LMs, and five smaller code LMs to the task of CAA to 6 diverse datasets that encompass 12k code snippets written by 463 developers. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis of our studied models' performance on CAA using established machine learning interpretability techniques. The results of our analysis illustrate important findings that illuminate the behavior of LMs in understanding stylometric code patterns during the task of CAA, and point towards important directions for future work.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Software Fairness Testing in Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17095v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software testing ensures that a system functions correctly, meets specified requirements, and maintains high quality. As artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) technologies become integral to software systems, testing has evolved to address their unique complexities. A critical advancement in this space is fairness testing, which identifies and mitigates biases in AI applications to promote ethical and equitable outcomes. Despite extensive academic research on fairness testing, including test input generation, test oracle identification, and component testing, practical adoption remains limited. Industry practitioners often lack clear guidelines and effective tools to integrate fairness testing into real-world AI development. This study investigates how software professionals test AI-powered systems for fairness through interviews with 22 practitioners working on AI and ML projects. Our findings highlight a significant gap between theoretical fairness concepts and industry practice. While fairness definitions continue to evolve, they remain difficult for practitioners to interpret and apply. The absence of industry-aligned fairness testing tools further complicates adoption, necessitating research into practical, accessible solutions. Key challenges include data quality and diversity, time constraints, defining effective metrics, and ensuring model interoperability. These insights emphasize the need to bridge academic advancements with actionable strategies and tools, enabling practitioners to systematically address fairness in AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PinChecker: Identifying Unsound Safe Abstractions of Rust Pinning APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14500v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pinning APIs of Rust language guarantee memory location stability for self-referential and asynchronous constructs, as long as used according to the pinning API contract. Rust ensures violations of such contract are impossible in regular safe code, but not in unsafe code where unsafe pinning APIs can be used. Library authors can encapsulate arbitrary unsafe code within regular library functions. These can be freely called in higher-level code without explicit warnings. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze library functions to rule out pinning API contract violations. Unfortunately, such testing relies on manual analysis by library authors, which is ineffective. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, given a library, attempts to construct programs that intentionally breach the pinning API contract by chaining library function calls, thereby verifying their soundness. We introduce RPIL, a novel intermediate representation that models functions' critical behaviors pertaining to pinning APIs. We implement PinChecker, a synthesis-driven violation detection tool guided by RPIL, which automatically synthesizes bug-revealing programs. Our experiments on 13 popular Rust libraries from crates.io found 2 confirmed bugs.</p></details> |  |

While Software Engineering (SE) optimization has a strong foundation, which is exemplified by the active Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) community and numerous classical optimization methods, the growing complexity of modern software systems and their engineering processes demands innovative solutions. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focuses specifically on studying the literature that applies quantum or quantum-inspired algorithms to solve classical SE optimization problems. We examine 77 primary studies selected from an initial pool of 2083 publications obtained through systematic searches of six digital databases using carefully crafted search strings. Our findings reveal concentrated research efforts in areas such as SE operations and software testing, while exposing significant gaps across other SE activities. Additionally, the SLR uncovers relevant works published outside traditional SE venues, underscoring the necessity of this comprehensive review. Overall, our study provides a broad overview of the research landscape, empowering the SBSE community to leverage quantum advancements in addressing next-generation SE challenges.</p></details> |  |

These models pose challenges in diagnosing failures, tracing anomalies, and maintaining transparency, with current manual testing methods being inefficient and labor-intensive. This vision paper presents a methodology that integrates explainability, transparency, and interpretability into V&V processes. We propose refining V&V requirements through literature reviews and stakeholder input, generating explainable test scenarios via large language models (LLMs), and enabling real-time validation in simulation environments. Our framework includes test oracle, explanation generation, and a test chatbot, with empirical studies planned to evaluate improvements in diagnostic efficiency and transparency. Our goal is to streamline V&V, reduce resources, and build user trust in autonomous technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to be published at SE4ADS</p></details> |

| **[Behavior Driven Development for 3D Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17057v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer 3D games are complex software environments that require novel testing processes to ensure high-quality standards. The Intelligent Verification/Validation for Extended Reality Based Systems (iv4XR) framework addresses this need by enabling the implementation of autonomous agents to automate game testing scenarios. This framework facilitates the automation of regression test cases for complex 3D games like Space Engineers. Nevertheless, the technical expertise required to define test scripts using iv4XR can constrain seamless collaboration between developers and testers. This paper reports how integrating a Behavior-driven Development (BDD) approach with the iv4XR framework allows the industrial company behind Space Engineers to automate regression testing. The success of this industrial collaboration has inspired the iv4XR team to integrate the BDD approach to improve the automation of play-testing for the experimental 3D game LabRecruits. Furthermore, the iv4XR framework has been extended with tactical programming to enable the automation of long-play test scenarios in Space Engineers. These results underscore the versatility of the iv4XR framework in supporting diverse testing approaches while showcasing how BDD empowers users to create, manage, and execute automated game tests using comprehensive and human-readable statements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Quantum Eigensolver Algorithms With Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13587v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore accelerating Hamiltonian ground state energy calculation on NISQ devices. We suggest using search-based methods together with machine learning to accelerate quantum algorithms, exemplified in the Quantum Eigensolver use case. We trained two small models on classically mined data from systems with up to 16 qubits, using XGBoost's Python regressor. We evaluated our preliminary approach on 20-, 24- and 28-qubit systems by optimising the Eigensolver's hyperparameters. These models predict hyperparameter values, leading to a 0.12% reduction in error when tested on 28-qubit systems. However, due to inconclusive results with 20- and 24-qubit systems, we suggest further examination of the training data based on Hamiltonian characteristics. In future work, we plan to train machine learning models to optimise other aspects or subroutines of quantum algorithm execution beyond its hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |

However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[MLDebugging: Towards Benchmarking Code Debugging Across Multi-Library Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13824v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code debugging is a crucial task in software engineering, which attracts increasing attention. While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios. We hope this work can uncover the potential of LLMs in multi-library debugging scenario and offer insights for future research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Hessian-Based Insights Support Fault Diagnosis in Attention-based Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07871v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity, diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis) and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRepair: An Exploratory Study on Merging Task-Specific Adapters in Code LLMs for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09568v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown high capabilities in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, 34% of reported issues are quantum-specific, highlighting the need for specialized debugging tools beyond conventional software engineering approaches. This study provides empirical insights into the software engineering challenges of quantum computing, offering recommendations to improve development workflows, tooling, and documentation. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Identify Flakiness in C++ Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12340v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of regression testing in software testing is crucial as it ensures that any new modifications do not disrupt the existing functionality and behaviour of the software system. The desired outcome is for regression tests to yield identical results without any modifications made to the system being tested. In practice, however, the presence of Flaky Tests introduces non-deterministic behaviour and undermines the reliability of regression testing results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for identifying the root cause of flaky tests in C++ projects at the code level, with the intention of assisting developers in debugging and resolving them more efficiently. We compile a comprehensive collection of C++ project flaky tests sourced from GitHub repositories. We fine-tune Mistral-7b, Llama2-7b and CodeLlama-7b models on the C++ dataset and an existing Java dataset and evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We assess the performance of the models across various datasets and offer recommendations for both research and industry applications. The results indicate that our models exhibit varying performance on the C++ dataset, while their performance is comparable to that of the Java dataset. The Mistral-7b surpasses the other two models regarding all metrics, achieving a score of 1. Our results demonstrate the exceptional capability of LLMs to accurately classify flakiness in C++ and Java projects, providing a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of debugging flaky tests in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM-Based Fault Localization with External Memory and Project Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03585v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 7 figures |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

However, existing debuggers are primarily tailored for human interaction, and those designed for programmatic debugging focus on kernel space, resulting in limited functionality in userland. To fill this gap, we introduce libdebug, a Python library for programmatic debugging of userland binary executables. libdebug offers a user-friendly API that enables developers to build custom debugging tools for various applications, including software engineering, reverse engineering, and software security. It is released as an open-source project, along with comprehensive documentation to encourage use and collaboration across the community. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of libdebug through case studies and benchmarks, all of which are publicly available. We find that the median latency of syscall and breakpoint handling in libdebug is 3 to 4 times lower compared to that of GDB.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |

LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

This work introduces JITScope, an interactive visualization framework that illustrates how IR nodes and instructions evolve across compilation phases. The system features a full-stack architecture: a Python-based backend transforms raw JSON-formatted IR data-representing an abstract model of the JIT compiler IR-into a normalized SQLite database; a controller layer serves processed CSV data; and a D3.js-powered frontend renders an interactive, phase-aware graph of IR node transformations. The design emphasizes modularity, traceability, and flexibility. Our roadmap explores intuitive visual representations of phase-level changes in IR node connectivity, values, and access patterns. Ultimately, JITScope lays a foundation for future tooling that enables visual exploration of IR evolution, including phase filtering, value tracking, and function-access mapping-offering a new lens into the behaviors and impacts of compiler optimizations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 8 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software, GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a unique corresponding event handler.</p></details> |  |

Virtual Platforms (VPs) have become indispensable tools for this purpose as they serve as a platform to execute and debug the unmodified target software at an early design stage. With the increasing complexity of software, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, VPs need to provide high simulation speed to ensure the target software executes within a reasonable time. Hybrid simulation, which combines virtual models with real hardware, can improve the performance of VPs. This paper introduces a novel approach for integrating real Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices into SystemC-TLM-2.0-based VPs. The embedded PCI devices enable high performance, easy integration, and allow introspection for analysis and optimization. To illustrate the practical application of our approach, we present a case study where we integrate Google Coral's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) into an ARM-based VP. The integration allows efficient execution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while eliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating AI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression testing across architectures, and device communication analysis.

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance.

| **[Toward a Better Understanding of Probabilistic Delta Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04735v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.</p></details> | accepted by ICSE25 |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |
| **[Towards Source Mapping for Zero-Knowledge Smart Contracts: Design and Preliminary Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04322v4)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and auditing zero-knowledge-compatible smart contracts remains a significant challenge due to the lack of source mapping in compilers such as zkSolc. In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.</p></details> |  |

Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Code-Edit Embedding to Model Student Debugging Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19407v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing effective feedback for programming assignments in computer science education can be challenging: students solve problems by iteratively submitting code, executing it, and using limited feedback from the compiler or the auto-grader to debug. Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025)</p></details> |

Exploring the Use of Android Record & Replay Tools in Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20237v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android User Interface (UI) testing is a critical research area due to the ubiquity of apps and the challenges faced by developers. Record and replay (R&R) tools facilitate manual and automated UI testing by recording UI actions to execute test scenarios and replay bugs. These tools typically support (i) regression testing, (ii) non-crashing functional bug reproduction, and (iii) crashing bug reproduction. However, prior work only examines these tools in fragmented settings, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across common use cases. We address this gap by conducting an empirical study on using R&R tools to record and replay non-crashing failures, crashing bugs, and feature-based user scenarios, and explore combining R&R with automated input generation (AIG) tools to replay crashing bugs. Our study involves one industrial and three academic R&R tools, 34 scenarios from 17 apps, 90 non-crashing failures from 42 apps, and 31 crashing bugs from 17 apps. Results show that 17% of scenarios, 38% of non-crashing bugs, and 44% of crashing bugs cannot be reliably recorded and replayed, mainly due to action interval resolution, API incompatibility, and Android tooling limitations. Our findings highlight key future research directions to enhance the practical application of R&R tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MobileSoft 2025</p></details> |

Put some Whamm on it!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20192v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and monitoring programs are integral to engineering and deploying software. Dynamic analyses monitor applications through source code or IR injection, machine code or bytecode rewriting, and virtual machine or direct hardware support. While these techniques are viable within their respective domains, common tooling across techniques is rare, leading to fragmentation of skills, duplicated efforts, and inconsistent feature support. We address this problem in the WebAssembly ecosystem with Whamm, a declarative instrumentation DSL for WebAssembly that abstracts above the instrumentation strategy, leveraging bytecode rewriting and engine support as available. Whamm solves three problems: 1) tooling fragmentation, 2) prohibitive instrumentation overhead of general-purpose frameworks, and 3) tedium of tailoring low-level high-performance mechanisms. Whamm provides fully-programmable instrumentation with declarative match rules, static and dynamic predication, automatic state reporting, and user library support, while achieving high performance through compiler and engine optimizations. At the back end, Whamm provides instrumentation to a Wasm engine as Wasm code, reusing existing engine optimizations and unlocking new ones, most notably intrinsification, to minimize overhead. In particular, explicitly requesting program state in match rules, rather than reflection, enables the engine to efficiently bundle arguments and even inline compiled probe logic. Whamm streamlines the tooling effort, as its bytecode-rewriting target can run instrumented programs everywhere, lowering fragmentation and advancing the state of the art for engine support. We evaluate Whamm with case studies of non-trivial monitors and show it is expressive, powerful, and efficient.</p></details> |  |

| **[VeriDebug: A Unified LLM for Verilog Debugging via Contrastive Embedding and Guided Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19099v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in debugging for various programming languages. However, the application of LLMs to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging. Unlike existing methods, VeriDebug employs an embedding-based technique to accurately retrieve internal information, followed by bug-fixing. VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves 64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo (36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of various large language models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA, GEMINI, and GPT-4o in interpreting such visual inputs. We employ prompt engineering techniques, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot learning, to assess each model's responsiveness and accuracy. Our findings show that while GPT-4o shows promising capabilities, achieving over 60% similarity to baseline questions for 51.75% of the tested images, challenges remain in obtaining consistent and accurate interpretations for more complex images. This research advances our understanding of the feasibility of using generative AI for image-centric problem-solving in developer communities, highlighting both the potential benefits and current limitations of this approach while envisioning a future where visual-based debugging copilot tools become a reality.</p></details> |  |

Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability, especially their error rates across domains and the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o). Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025. Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error distributions. Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50% with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%. Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over 50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates (~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability (10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability. Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from biological healing - where the human body detects damage, signals the brain, and activates targeted recovery - this paper explores the concept of self-healing software driven by artificial intelligence. We propose a novel framework that mimics this biological model system observability tools serve as sensory inputs, AI models function as the cognitive core for diagnosis and repair, and healing agents apply targeted code and test modifications. By combining log analysis, static code inspection, and AI-driven generation of patches or test updates, our approach aims to reduce downtime, accelerate debugging, and enhance software resilience. We evaluate the effectiveness of this model through case studies and simulations, comparing it against traditional manual debugging and recovery workflows. This work paves the way toward intelligent, adaptive and self-reliant software systems capable of continuous healing, akin to living organisms.</p></details> |  |

By introducing a complex search process during inference, type classes can lead to wholly inscrutable or useless errors. We describe a system, Argus, for interactively visualizing type class inferences to help programmers debug inference failures, applied specifically to Rust's trait system. The core insight of Argus is to avoid the traditional model of compiler diagnostics as one-size-fits-all, instead providing the programmer with different views on the search tree corresponding to different debugging goals. Argus carefully uses defaults to improve debugging productivity, including interface design (e.g., not showing full paths of types by default) and heuristics (e.g., sorting obligations based on the expected complexity of fixing them). We evaluated Argus in a user study where $N = 25$ participants debugged type inference failures in realistic Rust programs, finding that participants using Argus correctly localized $2.2\times$ as many faults and localized $3.3\times$ faster compared to not using Argus.</p></details> |  |

These missing links and data obstruct both developers and, more recently, large language models (LLMs) working with unfamiliar code. We present Codetations, a system that helps developers contextualize documents with rich notes and tools. Unlike previous approaches, notes in Codetations stay outside the document to prevent code clutter, attaching to spans in the document using a hybrid edit-tracking/LLM-based method. Their content is dynamic, interactive, and synchronized with code changes. A worked example shows that relevant notes with interactively-collected data improve LLM performance during code repair. In our user evaluation, developers praised these properties and saw significant potential in annotation types that we generated with an LLM in just a few minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design, where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix, we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct their software goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, FSE2025</p></details> |

Diffing Build Logs with CiDiff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18182v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous integration (CI) is widely used by developers to ensure the quality and reliability of their software projects. However, diagnosing a CI regression is a tedious process that involves the manual analysis of lengthy build logs. In this paper, we explore how textual differencing can support the debugging of CI regressions. As off-the-shelf diff algorithms produce suboptimal results, in this work we introduce a new diff algorithm specifically tailored to build logs called CiDiff. We evaluate CiDiff against several baselines on a novel dataset of 17 906 CI regressions, performing an accuracy study, a quantitative study and a user-study. Notably, our algorithm reduces the number of lines to inspect by about 60 % in the median case, with reasonable overhead compared to the state-of-practice LCS-diff. Finally, our algorithm is preferred by the majority of participants in 70 % of the regression cases, whereas LCS-diff is preferred in only 5 % of the cases.</p></details> |  |

(2) Showcases modern features, including per-app address spaces, threading, commodity filesystems, USB, DMA, multicore, self-hosted debugging, and a window manager. (3) Supports rich applications such as 2D/3D games, music and video players, and a blockchain miner. Unlike traditional instructional systems, VOS emphasizes strong motivation for building systems-supporting engaging, media-rich apps that go beyond basic terminal programs. To achieve this, we design VOS to strike a careful balance between essential OS complexity and overall simplicity. Our method, which we call inverse engineering, breaks down a full-featured OS into a set of incremental, self-contained prototypes. Each prototype introduces a minimal set of OS mechanisms, driven by the needs of specific apps. The construction process (i.e., forward engineering) then progressively enables these apps by bringing up one mechanism at a time. VOS makes it accessible for a wider audience to experience building a software system that is self-contained and usable in everyday scenarios.</p></details> |  |

General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2025 AI4EDU Workshop</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up industrial survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 17 images, 8 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, the lack of high-quality, scalable training datasets, especially those with verifiable outputs and intermediate reasoning traces-limits progress, particularly for open-source models. In this work, we present SWE-Synth, a framework for synthesizing realistic, verifiable, and process-aware bug-fix datasets at the repository level. SWE-Synth leverages LLM agents to simulate debugging workflows, producing not only bug-fix pairs but also test cases and structured repair trajectories. Compared to manually curated datasets, our method scales with minimal human effort while preserving contextual richness and correctness. Experiments show that models trained on SWE-Synth outperform those trained on real-world datasets by 2.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic, agent-generated data to advance the state of the art in APR and software engineering automation.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the complexity inherent to AI poses new challenges. Explainable AI (XAI) may allow developers to understand better the systems they build, which, in turn, can help with tasks like debugging. In this paper, we report insights from a series of surveys with software developers that highlight that there is indeed an increased need for explanatory tools to support developers in creating AI systems. However, the feedback also indicates that existing XAI systems still fall short of this aspiration. Thus, we see an unmet need to provide developers with adequate support mechanisms to cope with this complexity so they can embed AI into high-quality software in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Engineering Interactive Systems Embedding AI Technologies at EICS 2024, Tuesday June 25th, 2024 - Cagliary, Sardinia, Italy</p></details> |

It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools implement the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose ChaosEater, a system for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines the agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for Kubernetes systems, which are managed through code (i.e., Infrastructure as Code). Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater perform software engineering tasks to complete CE cycles, including requirement definition, code generation, debugging, and testing. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on both small and large Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it stably completes reasonable single CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. The CE cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>114 p...</summary><p>114 pages (7 main), 11 figures.

| **[Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15756v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p></details> |  |

In addition, it also serves as the cornerstone of the final sign-off, determining whether the chip is ready to be sent to the semiconductor foundry for fabrication. Recently, as the technology advance relentlessly, smaller metal pitches and the increasing number of devices have led to greater challenges and longer turn-around-time for experienced human designers to debug timing issues from the Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) timing reports. As a result, an efficient and intelligent methodology is highly necessary and essential for debugging timing issues and reduce the turnaround times. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise across various tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, incorporating reasoning and actions. In this work, we propose a timing analysis agent, that is empowered by multi-LLMs task solving, and incorporates a novel hierarchical planning and solving flow to automate the analysis of timing reports from commercial tool. In addition, we build a Timing Debug Relation Graph (TDRG) that connects the reports with the relationships of debug traces from experienced timing engineers. The timing analysis agent employs the novel Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, that includes agent and coding to retrieve data accurately, on the developed TDRG. In our studies, the proposed timing analysis agent achieves an average 98% pass-rate on a single-report benchmark and a 90% pass-rate for multi-report benchmark from industrial designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PinChecker: Identifying Unsound Safe Abstractions of Rust Pinning APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14500v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pinning APIs of Rust language guarantee memory location stability for self-referential and asynchronous constructs, as long as used according to the pinning API contract. Rust ensures violations of such contract are impossible in regular safe code, but not in unsafe code where unsafe pinning APIs can be used. Library authors can encapsulate arbitrary unsafe code within regular library functions. These can be freely called in higher-level code without explicit warnings. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze library functions to rule out pinning API contract violations. Unfortunately, such testing relies on manual analysis by library authors, which is ineffective. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, given a library, attempts to construct programs that intentionally breach the pinning API contract by chaining library function calls, thereby verifying their soundness. We introduce RPIL, a novel intermediate representation that models functions' critical behaviors pertaining to pinning APIs. We implement PinChecker, a synthesis-driven violation detection tool guided by RPIL, which automatically synthesizes bug-revealing programs. Our experiments on 13 popular Rust libraries from crates.io found 2 confirmed bugs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, FM providers introduced tool calling-triggering a proliferation of frameworks with distinct tool interfaces. In late 2024, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize this tool ecosystem, which has become the de facto standard with over eight million weekly SDK downloads. Despite its adoption, MCP's AI-driven, non-deterministic control flow introduces new risks to sustainability, security, and maintainability, warranting closer examination. Towards this end, we present the first large-scale empirical study of MCP servers. Using state-of-the-art health metrics and a hybrid analysis pipeline, combining a general-purpose static analysis tool with an MCP-specific scanner, we evaluate 1,899 open-source MCP servers to assess their health, security, and maintainability. Despite MCP servers demonstrating strong health metrics, we identify eight distinct vulnerabilities - only three overlapping with traditional software vulnerabilities. Additionally, 7.2% of servers contain general vulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning. Regarding maintainability, while 66% exhibit code smells, 14.4% contain nine bug patterns overlapping with traditional open-source software projects. These findings highlight the need for MCP-specific vulnerability detection techniques while reaffirming the value of traditional analysis and refactoring practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |

We exploit the modular structure of the plant to be controlled, given as a set of labelled transition systems (LTS), to mitigate state explosion that monolithic approaches to synthesis are prone to. Maximally permissive safe controllers are iteratively built for subsets of the plant LTSs by solving weaker control problems. Observational synthesis equivalence is used to reduce the size of the controlled subset of the plant by abstracting away local events. The result of synthesis is also compositional, a set of controllers that when run in parallel ensure the LTL goal. We implement synthesis in the MTSA tool for an expressive subset of LTL, GR(1), and show it computes solutions to that can be up to 1000 times larger than those that the monolithic approach can solve.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CAV25</p></details> |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |

However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases, remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests. This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its high-quality training data.

| **[AlphaTrans: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Approach for Repository-Level Code Translation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |

Existing APR systems are primarily evaluated in unimodal settings (e.g., SWE-bench). However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal problem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and leveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on visual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and generate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal reasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding and capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key components, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch validation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue report, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code responsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into executable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the visual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of the patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue, providing feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M, and the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o as the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best open-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the base model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances, outperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on incorporating cross-modal reasoning by understanding and capturing visual information to resolve multimodal issues.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention. To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Bugs in Data Visualization Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15084v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proc....</summary><p>Proc. ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE</p></details> |

It shows that LLMs struggle to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities during vulnerability detection. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing LLMs with multi-dimensional vulnerability knowledge distilled from historical vulnerabilities and fixes. We design a novel knowledge-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework Vul-RAG, which improves LLMs with an accuracy increase of 16% - 24% in identifying vulnerable and patched code. Additionally, vulnerability knowledge generated by Vul-RAG can further (1) serve as high-quality explanations to improve manual detection accuracy (from 60% to 77%), and (2) detect 10 previously-unknown bugs in the recent Linux kernel release with 6 assigned CVEs.</p></details> |  |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs and Stack Overflow Discussions: Reliability, Impact, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08801v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.</p></details> | 63 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Behavior Driven Development for 3D Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17057v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer 3D games are complex software environments that require novel testing processes to ensure high-quality standards. The Intelligent Verification/Validation for Extended Reality Based Systems (iv4XR) framework addresses this need by enabling the implementation of autonomous agents to automate game testing scenarios. This framework facilitates the automation of regression test cases for complex 3D games like Space Engineers. Nevertheless, the technical expertise required to define test scripts using iv4XR can constrain seamless collaboration between developers and testers. This paper reports how integrating a Behavior-driven Development (BDD) approach with the iv4XR framework allows the industrial company behind Space Engineers to automate regression testing. The success of this industrial collaboration has inspired the iv4XR team to integrate the BDD approach to improve the automation of play-testing for the experimental 3D game LabRecruits. Furthermore, the iv4XR framework has been extended with tactical programming to enable the automation of long-play test scenarios in Space Engineers. These results underscore the versatility of the iv4XR framework in supporting diverse testing approaches while showcasing how BDD empowers users to create, manage, and execute automated game tests using comprehensive and human-readable statements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PinChecker: Identifying Unsound Safe Abstractions of Rust Pinning APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14500v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pinning APIs of Rust language guarantee memory location stability for self-referential and asynchronous constructs, as long as used according to the pinning API contract. Rust ensures violations of such contract are impossible in regular safe code, but not in unsafe code where unsafe pinning APIs can be used. Library authors can encapsulate arbitrary unsafe code within regular library functions. These can be freely called in higher-level code without explicit warnings. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze library functions to rule out pinning API contract violations. Unfortunately, such testing relies on manual analysis by library authors, which is ineffective. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, given a library, attempts to construct programs that intentionally breach the pinning API contract by chaining library function calls, thereby verifying their soundness. We introduce RPIL, a novel intermediate representation that models functions' critical behaviors pertaining to pinning APIs. We implement PinChecker, a synthesis-driven violation detection tool guided by RPIL, which automatically synthesizes bug-revealing programs. Our experiments on 13 popular Rust libraries from crates.io found 2 confirmed bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |
| **[AlphaTrans: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Approach for Repository-Level Code Translation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Thermal Modeling and Optimal Allocation of Avionics Safety-critical Tasks on Heterogeneous MPSoCs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22214v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoC) can deliver high performance needed in many industrial domains, including aerospace. However, their high power consumption, combined with avionics safety standards, brings new thermal management challenges. This paper investigates techniques for offline thermal-aware allocation of periodic tasks on heterogeneous MPSoCs running at a fixed clock frequency, as required in avionics. The goal is to find the assignment of tasks to (i) cores and (ii) temporal isolation windows while minimizing the MPSoC temperature. To achieve that, we propose and analyze three power models, and integrate them within several novel optimization approaches based on heuristics, a black-box optimizer, and Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We perform the experimental evaluation on three popular MPSoC platforms (NXP i.MX8QM MEK, NXP i.MX8QM Ixora, NVIDIA TX2) and observe a difference of up to 5.5{\deg}C among the tested methods (corresponding to a 22% reduction w.r.t. the ambient temperature). We also show that our method, integrating the empirical power model with the ILP, outperforms the other methods on all tested platforms.</p></details> | Accepted version |
| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing is Fixing: Cross-Modal Reasoning with Multimodal LLMs for Visual Software Issue Fixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16136v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-(LLM) based automated program repair (APR) techniques have shown promising results in resolving real-world GitHub issue tasks. Existing APR systems are primarily evaluated in unimodal settings (e.g., SWE-bench). However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal problem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and leveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on visual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and generate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal reasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding and capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key components, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch validation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue report, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code responsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into executable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the visual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of the patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue, providing feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M, and the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o as the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best open-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the base model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances, outperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on incorporating cross-modal reasoning by understanding and capturing visual information to resolve multimodal issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExploraCoder: Advancing code generation for multiple unseen APIs via planning and chained exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05366v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models face intrinsic limitations in coding with APIs that are unseen in their training corpora. As libraries continuously evolve, it becomes impractical to exhaustively retrain LLMs with new API knowledge. This limitation hampers LLMs from solving programming problems which require newly introduced or privately maintained libraries. Inspired by exploratory programming paradigm in human behavior, we propose ExploraCoder, a training-free framework that empowers LLMs to invoke multiple unseen APIs in code solution by (1) planning a complex problem into several API invocation subtasks, and (2) experimenting with correct API usage at intermediate steps through a novel chain-of-API-exploration. We conduct evaluation on program synthesizing tasks involving complex API interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that ExploraCoder significantly improves performance for models lacking prior API knowledge, achieving absolute increases of up to 11.99% over retrieval-based approaches and 17.28% over pretraining-based methods in pass@10.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Adaptation: Comparing AI-Assisted Strategies in High School Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15955v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This exploratory case study investigated two contrasting pedagogical approaches for LCA-assisted programming with five novice high school students preparing for a WeChat Mini Program competition. In Phase 1, students used LCAs to generate code from abstract specifications (From-Scratch approach), achieving only 20% MVP completion. In Phase 2, students adapted existing Minimal Functional Units (MFUs), small, functional code examples, using LCAs, achieving 100% MVP completion. Analysis revealed that the MFU-based approach succeeded by aligning with LCA strengths in pattern modification rather than de novo generation, while providing cognitive scaffolds that enabled students to navigate complex development tasks. The study introduces a dual-scaffolding model combining technical support (MFUs) with pedagogical guidance (structured prompting strategies), demonstrating that effective LCA integration depends less on AI capabilities than on instructional design. These findings offer practical guidance for educators seeking to transform AI tools from sources of frustration into productive learning partners in programming education.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained, semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation. Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.</p></details> |  |

This challenge becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library. Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates 1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.</p></details> | 29 pages |

Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a library.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, conference paper</p></details> |

Defect taxonomies are valuable tools for this, offering a common language for issues and enabling systematic tracking. A significant prior study developed such a taxonomy, but based it exclusively on the declarative language Puppet. It remained unknown whether this taxonomy applies to programming language-based IaC (PL-IaC) tools like Pulumi, Terraform CDK, and AWS CDK. Aim: We replicated this foundational work to assess the generalizability of the taxonomy across a broader and more diverse landscape. Method: We performed qualitative analysis on 3,364 defect-related commits from 285 open-source PL-IaC repositories (PIPr dataset) to derive a PL-IaC-specific defect taxonomy. We then enhanced the ACID tool, originally developed for the prior study, to automatically classify and analyze defect distributions across an expanded dataset-447 open-source repositories and 94 proprietary projects from VTEX (e-commerce) and Nubank (financial). Results: Our research confirmed the same eight defect categories identified in the original study, with idempotency and security defects appearing infrequently but persistently across projects. Configuration Data defects maintain high frequency in both open-source and proprietary codebases. Conclusions: Our replication supports the generalizability of the original taxonomy, suggesting IaC development challenges surpass organizational boundaries. Configuration Data defects emerge as a persistent high-frequency problem, while idempotency and security defects remain important concerns despite lower frequency. These patterns appear consistent across open-source and proprietary projects, indicating they are fundamental to the IaC paradigm itself, transcending specific tools or project types.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same redzone setting.</p></details> |  |

Traditional fuzzing evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features influence fuzzing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to generate programs with configurable, fine-grained program features to enhance fuzzing evaluations. We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Performance Constraints for Evaluating and Improving Code Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23471v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to optimize code efficiency. Evaluating their effectiveness and further suggesting optimization opportunities often rely on high-quality tests to demonstrate the performance bottlenecks presented in the program. However, existing approaches rely on a limited set of hand-curated inputs or LLM-generated uninteresting length-stressing tests, failing to reveal more nuanced optimization opportunities. We present WEDGE, a framework for generating performance-stressing input given the program under test. WEDGE synthesizes explicit performance-characterizing constraints in the form of branch conditions to partition the programs' execution space into performance-specific regions. When integrated with the coverage-guided fuzzer, reaching different regions introduces explicit rewards for test generation to explore inefficient implementations. Our evaluation shows that WEDGE introduces a significant slowdown compared to the tests in CodeContests and those claimed to be optimized by existing approaches. From the utility perspective, integrating our tests substantially improves the existing code optimization approaches that rely on test-driven execution feedback. We release PERFFORGE, the performance tests generated by WEDGE, to benchmark future approaches for efficient code generation at https://github.com/UChiSeclab/perfforge.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

However, how to minimize hallucinations in the generated comments remains significant challenges. In this paper, we propose IsComment, an issue-based LLM retrieval and verification approach for generating method's design rationale, usage directives, and so on as supplementary code comments. We first identify five main types of code supplementary information that issue reports can provide through code-comment-issue analysis. Next, we retrieve issue sentences containing these types of supplementary information and generate candidate code comments. To reduce hallucinations, we filter out those candidate comments that are irrelevant to the code or unverifiable by the issue report, making the code comment generation results more reliable. Our experiments indicate that compared with LLMs, IsComment increases the coverage of manual supplementary comments from 33.6% to 72.2% for ChatGPT, from 35.8% to 88.4% for GPT-4o, and from 35.0% to 86.2% for DeepSeek-V3. Compared with existing work, IsComment can generate richer and more useful supplementary code comments for programming understanding, which is quantitatively evaluated through the MESIA metric on both methods with and without manual code comments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

| **[Guaranteed Guess: A Language Modeling Approach for CISC-to-RISC Transpilation with Testing Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14606v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hardware ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with increasing interest in translating low-level programs across different instruction set architectures (ISAs) in a quick, flexible, and correct way to enhance the portability and longevity of existing code. A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks. We will open-source our codes, data, models, and benchmarks to establish a common foundation for ISA-level code translation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ahmedheakl.github.io/Guaranteed-Guess/</p></details> |
| **[A Quantum Annealing Approach for Solving Optimal Feature Selection and Next Release Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14129v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Search-based software engineering (SBSE) addresses critical optimization challenges in software engineering, including the next release problem (NRP) and feature selection problem (FSP). While traditional heuristic approaches and integer linear programming (ILP) methods have demonstrated efficacy for small to medium-scale problems, their scalability to large-scale instances remains unknown. Here, we introduce quantum annealing (QA) as a subroutine to tackling multi-objective SBSE problems, leveraging the computational potential of quantum systems. We propose two QA-based algorithms tailored to different problem scales. For small-scale problems, we reformulate multi-objective optimization (MOO) as single-objective optimization (SOO) using penalty-based mappings for quantum processing. For large-scale problems, we employ a decomposition strategy guided by maximum energy impact (MEI), integrating QA with a steepest descent method to enhance local search efficiency. Applied to NRP and FSP, our approaches are benchmarked against the heuristic NSGA-II and the ILP-based $\epsilon$-constraint method. Experimental results reveal that while our methods produce fewer non-dominated solutions than $\epsilon$-constraint, they achieve significant reductions in execution time. Moreover, compared to NSGA-II, our methods deliver more non-dominated solutions with superior computational efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of QA in advancing scalable and efficient solutions for SBSE challenges.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the bugs in the Jupyter platform is essential for ensuring its correctness, security, and robustness. Previous studies focused on code reuse, restoration, and repair execution environment for Jupyter notebooks. However, the bugs in Jupyter notebooks' hosting platform Jupyter are not investigated. In this paper, we investigate 387 bugs in the Jupyter platform. These Jupyter bugs are classified into 11 root causes and 11 bug symptoms. We identify 14 major findings for developers. More importantly, our study opens new directions in building tools for detecting and fixing bugs in the Jupyter platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeImprove: Program Adaptation for Deep Code Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15804v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging deep learning (DL)-based code analysis tools to solve software engineering tasks is becoming increasingly popular. Code models often suffer performance degradation due to various reasons (e.g., code data shifts). Retraining is often required to address these issues, but frequent model updates are costly in labeling and deployment. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution: Adapting the program inputs to the code models. This can be achieved by two steps: 1) input validation that focuses on identifying whether an input is an out-of-scope input program that are beyond a model's handling capability, and 2) input adaptation that adapts out-of-scope inputs to become in-scope inputs. Validating program input is challenging, as current techniques focus on continuous inputs such as image data and fail with discrete inputs like code data, which have unique characteristics and are processed differently by deep learning models. Adapting out-of-scope programs is also challenging due to their vast search spaces. Therefore, in this paper, we propose CodeImprove, which distinguishes out-of-scope from normal inputs and converts such out-of-scope inputs back to in-scope inputs through program transformation. In particular, we propose a validity score metric to identify out-of-scope inputs and leverage genetic algorithms to apply semantic preserving program transformation to convert out-of-scope inputs to in-scope inputs. Our experimental results show CodeImprove can enhance up to 8.78% of accuracy, and 51.28% of relative improvements in three code models on two SE tasks. Additionally, our input validation is promising in detecting out-of-scope inputs (AUC score of 0.924).</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[How Does LLM Reasoning Work for Code? A Survey and a Call to Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13932v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has led to dramatic improvements across a wide range of natural language tasks. These advancements have extended into the domain of code, facilitating complex tasks such as code generation, translation, summarization, and repair. However, their utility for real-world deployment in-the-wild has only recently been studied, particularly on software engineering (SWE) tasks such as GitHub issue resolution. In this study, we examine the code reasoning techniques that underlie the ability to perform such tasks, and examine the paradigms used to drive their performance. Our contributions in this paper are: (1) the first dedicated survey on code reasoning for code tasks, highlighting overarching strategies, hybrid and agentic approaches; (2) a taxonomy of various techniques used to drive code reasoning; (3) a comprehensive overview of performance on common benchmarks and a showcase of new, under-explored benchmarks with high potential in SWE; (4) an exploration on how core properties of code can be used to explain different reasoning techniques; and (5) gaps and potentially under-explored areas for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bug-Free Distributed Go Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15135v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programmers of distributed systems need to reason about concurrency to avoid races. However, reasoning about concurrency is difficult, and unexpected races show up as bugs. Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied (dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race detection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not related by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race consists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared channel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific message from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can receive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all. In this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence of communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go programming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message passing. We statically reason about how a distributed program executes, using a happens-before order, extended to buffered and unbuffered channels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 1.

Current methods primarily focus on correctness, often overlooking efficiency. To address this gap, we introduce EffiCoder to improve both aspects by fine-tuning LLMs on a high-quality dataset comprising correct and efficient code samples. Our methodology involves leveraging multiple LLMs to generate diverse candidate code solutions for various tasks across different programming languages. We then evaluate these solutions by measuring their execution time and memory usage through local execution. The code solution with the lowest execution time and memory consumption is selected as the final output for each task. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements when fine-tuning with Effi-Instruct. For instance, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct's pass@1 score increases from 44.8\% to 57.7\%, while the average execution time for correct tasks decreases by 48.4\%. EffiCoder offers a scalable and effective solution for advancing AI-driven code generation, benefiting software development and computational problem-solving. The source code of Effi-Code was released at https://github.com/huangd1999/EffiCoder.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Isolating Noisy Labelled Test Cases in Human-in-the-Loop Oracle Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13273v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorrectly labelled test cases can adversely affect the training process of human-in-the-loop oracle learning tech-niques. This paper introduces ISONOISE, a technique designed to identify such mislabelled test cases introduced during human-in-the-loop oracle learning. This technique can be applied to programs taking numeric inputs. Given a compromised automatic test oracle and its training test suite, ISONOISE first isolates thetest cases suspected of being mislabelled. This task is performed based on the level of disagreement of a test case with respect to the others. An intermediate automatic test oracle is trained based on the slightly disagreeing test cases. Based on the predictions of this intermediate oracle, the test cases suspected of being mislabelled are systematically presented for relabelling. When mislabelled test cases are found, the intermediate test oracle is updated. This process repeats until no mislabelled test case is found in relabelling. ISONOISE was evaluated within the human-in-the-loop oracle learning method used in LEARN2FIX. Experimental results demonstrate that ISONOISE can identify mislabelled test cases introduced by the human in LEARN2FIX with over 67% accuracy, while requiring only a small number of relabelling queries. These findings highlight the potential of ISONOISE to enhance the reliability of human-in-the-loop oracle learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE)</p></details> |
| **[Empirical Evaluation of Large Language Models in Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13186v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of software bugs has made automated program repair (APR) a key research focus. Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for APR, but existing studies mostly rely on smaller, earlier-generation models and Java benchmarks. The repair capabilities of modern, large-scale LLMs across diverse languages and scenarios remain underexplored. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of four open-source LLMs, CodeLlama, LLaMA, StarCoder, and DeepSeek-Coder, spanning 7B to 33B parameters, diverse architectures, and purposes. We evaluate them across two bug scenarios (enterprise-grades and algorithmic), three languages (Java, C/C++, Python), and four prompting strategies, analyzing over 600K generated patches on six benchmarks. Key findings include: (1) model specialization (e.g., CodeLlama) can outperform larger general-purpose models (e.g., LLaMA); (2) repair performance does not scale linearly with model size; (3) correct patches often appear early in generation; and (4) prompts significantly affect results. These insights offer practical guidance for designing effective and efficient LLM-based APR systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Empirical Evaluation to Context-Aware Enhancement: Repairing Regression Errors with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13182v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[...] Since then, various APR approaches, especially those leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), have been rapidly developed to fix general software bugs. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these advanced techniques in the context of regression bugs remains largely unexplored. This gap motivates the need for an empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of modern APR techniques in fixing real-world regression bugs. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of APR techniques on Java regression bugs. To facilitate our study, we introduce RegMiner4APR, a high-quality benchmark of Java regression bugs integrated into a framework designed to facilitate APR research. The current benchmark includes 99 regression bugs collected from 32 widely used real-world Java GitHub repositories. We begin by conducting an in-depth analysis of the benchmark, demonstrating its diversity and quality. Building on this foundation, we empirically evaluate the capabilities of APR to regression bugs by assessing both traditional APR tools and advanced LLM-based APR approaches. Our experimental results show that classical APR tools fail to repair any bugs, while LLM-based APR approaches exhibit promising potential. Motivated by these results, we investigate impact of incorporating bug-inducing change information into LLM-based APR approaches for fixing regression bugs. Our results highlight that this context-aware enhancement significantly improves the performance of LLM-based APR, yielding 1.8x more successful repairs compared to using LLM-based APR without such context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination to Consensus: Multi-Agent LLMs for End-to-End Test Generation with Accurate Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02943v4)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To lay this bare, we recall the costs of some of the major software failures that happened during the last~$40$ years. We argue that these costs justify researching, studying and applying formal software verification and in particular program analysis. This position is supported by successful industrial experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Program Synthesis using LLMs: Results and Insights from the IPARC Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13820v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The IPARC Challenge, inspired by ARC, provides controlled program synthesis tasks over synthetic images to evaluate automatic program construction, focusing on sequence, selection, and iteration. This set of 600 tasks has resisted automated solutions. This paper presents a structured inductive programming approach with LLMs that successfully solves tasks across all IPARC categories. The controlled nature of IPARC reveals insights into LLM-based code generation, including the importance of prior structuring, LLMs' ability to aid structuring (requiring human refinement), the need to freeze correct code, the efficiency of code reuse, and how LLM-generated code can spark human creativity. These findings suggest valuable mechanisms for human-LLM collaboration in tackling complex program synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering Scientific Assistants using Interactive Structured Induction of Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14488v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists. It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.</p></details> |  |

As part of HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming. Our code and dataset are also public available(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).</p></details> |  |

We wanted to know if the reality is the same as expectations of AI-based programming assistants when trying to fulfil software privacy requirements, and the challenges developers face when using AI-based programming assistants and how these can be improved. To this end, we conducted a survey with 51 professional developers worldwide. We found that AI-based programming assistants need to be improved in order for developers to better trust them with generating code that ensures privacy. In this paper, we provide some recommendations including model and system-level improvements and some key further research directions to improve AI-based programming assistants for developing secure code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at EASE'25 - short papers and emerging results track</p></details> |

However, there is a lack of systematized understanding of how training initiatives are designed, implemented, and evaluated within this domain. Objective: This study aims to map the current state of research on corporate training in software engineering in industry settings, using Eduardo Salas' training framework as an analytical lens. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted involving the selection and analysis of 26 primary studies published in the field. Each study was categorized according to Salas' four key areas: Training Needs Analysis, Antecedent Training Conditions, Training Methods and Instructional Strategies, and Post-Training Conditions. Results: The findings show a predominance of studies focusing on Training Methods and Instructional Strategies. Significant gaps were identified in other areas, particularly regarding Job/Task Analysis and Simulation-based Training and Games. Most studies were experience reports, lacking methodological rigor and longitudinal assessment. Conclusions: The study offers a structured overview of how corporate training is approached in software engineering, revealing underexplored areas and proposing directions for future research. It contributes to both academic and practical communities by highlighting challenges, methodological trends, and opportunities for designing more effective training programs in industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Augmented Code Generation Using Programming Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18251v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code-LLMs (CLLMs) have significantly improved code generation, but, they frequently face difficulties when dealing with challenging and complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the inference time. However, retrieval models often fail to find most relevant context, and generation models, with limited context capacity, can hallucinate when given irrelevant data. We present a novel framework that leverages a Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code. This approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most relevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning technique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more hallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two retrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing context granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our method improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 34% on MBPP. Our contributions include PKG-based retrieval, tree pruning to enhance retrieval precision, a re-ranking method for robust solution selection and a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) enhancer module for automatic code augmentation with relevant comments and docstrings.</p></details> | 20 pages, Conference |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs and Stack Overflow Discussions: Reliability, Impact, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08801v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.</p></details> | 63 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17125v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization of sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal compliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reassessing Code Authorship Attribution in the Era of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17120v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of Code Stylometry, and in particular Code Authorship Attribution (CAA), aims to analyze coding styles to identify the authors of code samples. CAA is crucial in cybersecurity and software forensics for addressing, detecting plagiarism, and supporting criminal prosecutions. However, CAA is a complex and error prone task, due to the need for recognizing nuanced relationships between coding patterns. This challenge is compounded in large software systems with numerous authors due to the subtle variability of patterns that signify the coding style of one author among many. Given the challenges related to this task, researchers have proposed and studied automated approaches that rely upon classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. However, such techniques have historically relied upon hand-crafted features, and due to the often intricate interaction of different features (e.g., formatting, etc.), have key limitations in properly characterizing authorship, and are sensitive to adversarial code perturbations. Recently, transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have shown remarkable efficacy across a range of software engineering tasks, and in the authorship attribution on natural language in the NLP domain. However, their effectiveness in CAA is not well understood. As such, we conduct the first extensive empirical study applying two larger state-of-the-art code LMs, and five smaller code LMs to the task of CAA to 6 diverse datasets that encompass 12k code snippets written by 463 developers. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis of our studied models' performance on CAA using established machine learning interpretability techniques. The results of our analysis illustrate important findings that illuminate the behavior of LMs in understanding stylometric code patterns during the task of CAA, and point towards important directions for future work.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Software Fairness Testing in Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17095v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software testing ensures that a system functions correctly, meets specified requirements, and maintains high quality. As artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) technologies become integral to software systems, testing has evolved to address their unique complexities. A critical advancement in this space is fairness testing, which identifies and mitigates biases in AI applications to promote ethical and equitable outcomes. Despite extensive academic research on fairness testing, including test input generation, test oracle identification, and component testing, practical adoption remains limited. Industry practitioners often lack clear guidelines and effective tools to integrate fairness testing into real-world AI development. This study investigates how software professionals test AI-powered systems for fairness through interviews with 22 practitioners working on AI and ML projects. Our findings highlight a significant gap between theoretical fairness concepts and industry practice. While fairness definitions continue to evolve, they remain difficult for practitioners to interpret and apply. The absence of industry-aligned fairness testing tools further complicates adoption, necessitating research into practical, accessible solutions. Key challenges include data quality and diversity, time constraints, defining effective metrics, and ensuring model interoperability.

| **[Behavior Driven Development for 3D Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17057v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer 3D games are complex software environments that require novel testing processes to ensure high-quality standards. The Intelligent Verification/Validation for Extended Reality Based Systems (iv4XR) framework addresses this need by enabling the implementation of autonomous agents to automate game testing scenarios. This framework facilitates the automation of regression test cases for complex 3D games like Space Engineers. Nevertheless, the technical expertise required to define test scripts using iv4XR can constrain seamless collaboration between developers and testers. This paper reports how integrating a Behavior-driven Development (BDD) approach with the iv4XR framework allows the industrial company behind Space Engineers to automate regression testing. The success of this industrial collaboration has inspired the iv4XR team to integrate the BDD approach to improve the automation of play-testing for the experimental 3D game LabRecruits. Furthermore, the iv4XR framework has been extended with tactical programming to enable the automation of long-play test scenarios in Space Engineers. These results underscore the versatility of the iv4XR framework in supporting diverse testing approaches while showcasing how BDD empowers users to create, manage, and execute automated game tests using comprehensive and human-readable statements.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge in achieving adequate explanations is the elicitation of individual explanation needs, as it may be subject to severe hypothetical or confirmation biases. To address these challenges, we aim to establish user-based indicators concerning user behavior or system events that can be captured at runtime to determine when a need for explanations arises. In this work, we conducted explorative research in form of an online study to collect self-reported indicators that could indicate a need for explanation. We compiled a catalog containing 17 relevant indicators concerning user behavior, 8 indicators concerning system events and 14 indicators concerning emotional states or physical reactions. We also analyze the relationships between these indicators and different types of need for explanation. The established indicators can be used in the elicitation process through prototypes, as well as after publication to gather requirements from already deployed applications using telemetry and usage data. Moreover, these indicators can be used to trigger explanations at appropriate moments during the runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the research track of the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Quantum Eigensolver Algorithms With Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13587v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore accelerating Hamiltonian ground state energy calculation on NISQ devices. We suggest using search-based methods together with machine learning to accelerate quantum algorithms, exemplified in the Quantum Eigensolver use case. We trained two small models on classically mined data from systems with up to 16 qubits, using XGBoost's Python regressor. We evaluated our preliminary approach on 20-, 24- and 28-qubit systems by optimising the Eigensolver's hyperparameters. These models predict hyperparameter values, leading to a 0.12% reduction in error when tested on 28-qubit systems. However, due to inconclusive results with 20- and 24-qubit systems, we suggest further examination of the training data based on Hamiltonian characteristics. In future work, we plan to train machine learning models to optimise other aspects or subroutines of quantum algorithm execution beyond its hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Rust ensures violations of such contract are impossible in regular safe code, but not in unsafe code where unsafe pinning APIs can be used. Library authors can encapsulate arbitrary unsafe code within regular library functions. These can be freely called in higher-level code without explicit warnings. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze library functions to rule out pinning API contract violations. Unfortunately, such testing relies on manual analysis by library authors, which is ineffective. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, given a library, attempts to construct programs that intentionally breach the pinning API contract by chaining library function calls, thereby verifying their soundness. We introduce RPIL, a novel intermediate representation that models functions' critical behaviors pertaining to pinning APIs. We implement PinChecker, a synthesis-driven violation detection tool guided by RPIL, which automatically synthesizes bug-revealing programs. Our experiments on 13 popular Rust libraries from crates.io found 2 confirmed bugs.</p></details> |  |

While Software Engineering (SE) optimization has a strong foundation, which is exemplified by the active Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) community and numerous classical optimization methods, the growing complexity of modern software systems and their engineering processes demands innovative solutions. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focuses specifically on studying the literature that applies quantum or quantum-inspired algorithms to solve classical SE optimization problems. We examine 77 primary studies selected from an initial pool of 2083 publications obtained through systematic searches of six digital databases using carefully crafted search strings. Our findings reveal concentrated research efforts in areas such as SE operations and software testing, while exposing significant gaps across other SE activities. Additionally, the SLR uncovers relevant works published outside traditional SE venues, underscoring the necessity of this comprehensive review. Overall, our study provides a broad overview of the research landscape, empowering the SBSE community to leverage quantum advancements in addressing next-generation SE challenges.</p></details> |  |

To address this, FM providers introduced tool calling-triggering a proliferation of frameworks with distinct tool interfaces. In late 2024, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize this tool ecosystem, which has become the de facto standard with over eight million weekly SDK downloads. Despite its adoption, MCP's AI-driven, non-deterministic control flow introduces new risks to sustainability, security, and maintainability, warranting closer examination. Towards this end, we present the first large-scale empirical study of MCP servers. Using state-of-the-art health metrics and a hybrid analysis pipeline, combining a general-purpose static analysis tool with an MCP-specific scanner, we evaluate 1,899 open-source MCP servers to assess their health, security, and maintainability. Despite MCP servers demonstrating strong health metrics, we identify eight distinct vulnerabilities - only three overlapping with traditional software vulnerabilities. Additionally, 7.2% of servers contain general vulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning. Regarding maintainability, while 66% exhibit code smells, 14.4% contain nine bug patterns overlapping with traditional open-source software projects. These findings highlight the need for MCP-specific vulnerability detection techniques while reaffirming the value of traditional analysis and refactoring practices.</p></details> |  |

But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeDiffuser: Attention-Enhanced Diffusion Policy via VLM-Generated Code for Instruction Ambiguity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16652v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit ambiguity and vagueness. For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025.

| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Satisfiability Checking of String Requirements by Consistent Data and Checker Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16639v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements over strings, commonly represented using natural language (NL), are particularly relevant for software systems due to their heavy reliance on string data manipulation. While individual requirements can usually be analyzed manually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL requirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers) may efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical limitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal constraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings is less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies the satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive a satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to generate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used to validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the performance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural language into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for Python-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a consistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements, leading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain cases compared to baselines without generated checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025 conference</p></details> |

Various safety mechanisms are simulated to assess their impact on mitigating attacks and enhancing ADAS resilience. Experimental results highlight the importance of timely intervention by human drivers and automated safety mechanisms in preventing accidents in both driving and lateral directions and the need to resolve conflicts among safety interventions to enhance system resilience and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, To appear in the 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2025)</p></details> |

The object of this research is the Quality Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, test case generation, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3% flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically identical coverage, "black box" nature and lack of explainability from state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies, considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate verification methodologies.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

We exploit the modular structure of the plant to be controlled, given as a set of labelled transition systems (LTS), to mitigate state explosion that monolithic approaches to synthesis are prone to. Maximally permissive safe controllers are iteratively built for subsets of the plant LTSs by solving weaker control problems. Observational synthesis equivalence is used to reduce the size of the controlled subset of the plant by abstracting away local events. The result of synthesis is also compositional, a set of controllers that when run in parallel ensure the LTL goal. We implement synthesis in the MTSA tool for an expressive subset of LTL, GR(1), and show it computes solutions to that can be up to 1000 times larger than those that the monolithic approach can solve.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CAV25</p></details> |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |

However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases, remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests. This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its high-quality training data.

Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |

However, their high power consumption, combined with avionics safety standards, brings new thermal management challenges. This paper investigates techniques for offline thermal-aware allocation of periodic tasks on heterogeneous MPSoCs running at a fixed clock frequency, as required in avionics. The goal is to find the assignment of tasks to (i) cores and (ii) temporal isolation windows while minimizing the MPSoC temperature. To achieve that, we propose and analyze three power models, and integrate them within several novel optimization approaches based on heuristics, a black-box optimizer, and Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We perform the experimental evaluation on three popular MPSoC platforms (NXP i.MX8QM MEK, NXP i.MX8QM Ixora, NVIDIA TX2) and observe a difference of up to 5.5{\deg}C among the tested methods (corresponding to a 22% reduction w.r.t. the ambient temperature). We also show that our method, integrating the empirical power model with the ILP, outperforms the other methods on all tested platforms.</p></details> | Accepted version |

We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to 71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing, such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight specific error patterns for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation.

| **[Chaos Engineering: A Multi-Vocal Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01416v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Organizations, particularly medium and large enterprises, typically rely heavily on complex, distributed systems to deliver critical services and products. However, the growing complexity of these systems poses challenges in ensuring service availability, performance, and reliability. Traditional resilience testing methods often fail to capture the intricate interactions and failure modes of modern systems. Chaos Engineering addresses these challenges by proactively testing how systems in production behave under turbulent conditions, allowing developers to uncover and resolve potential issues before they escalate into outages. Though chaos engineering has received growing attention from researchers and practitioners alike, we observed a lack of reviews that synthesize insights from both academic and grey literature. Hence, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) on chaos engineering to address this research gap by systematically analyzing 96 academic and grey literature sources published between January 2016 and April 2024. We first used the chosen sources to derive a unified definition of chaos engineering and to identify key functionalities, components, and adoption drivers. We also developed a taxonomy for chaos engineering platforms and compared the relevant tools using it. Finally, we analyzed the current state of chaos engineering research and identified several open research issues.</p></details> |  |

Code Technical Debt (Code TD) prediction has gained significant attention in recent software engineering research. However, no standardized approach to Code TD prediction fully captures the factors influencing its evolution. Objective. Our study aims to assess the impact of time-dependent models and seasonal effects on Code TD prediction. It evaluates such models against widely used Machine Learning models, also considering the influence of seasonality on prediction performance. Methods. We trained 11 prediction models with 31 Java open-source projects. To assess their performance, we predicted future observations of the SQALE index. To evaluate the practical usability of our TD forecasting model and its impact on practitioners, we surveyed 23 software engineering professionals. Results. Our study confirms the benefits of time-dependent techniques, with the ARIMAX model outperforming the others. Seasonal effects improved predictive performance, though the impact remained modest. \ReviewerA{ARIMAX/SARIMAX models demonstrated to provide well-balanced long-term forecasts. The survey highlighted strong industry interest in short- to medium-term TD forecasts. Conclusions. Our findings support using techniques that capture time dependence in historical software metric data, particularly for Code TD. Effectively addressing this evidence requires adopting methods that account for temporal patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, these quality attributes are notably vulnerable to technical debt (TD). Few studies address TD in microservice systems, particularly on a large scale. This research explores how TD manifests in a large-scale microservice-based industrial system. The research is based on a mixed-method case study of a project including over 100 microservices and serving over 15k locations. Results are collected via a quantitative method based static code analyzers combined with qualitative insights derived from a focus group discussion with the development team and a follow-up interview with the lead architect of the case study system. Results show that (1) simple static source code analysis can be an efficient and effective entry point for holistic TD discovery, (2) inadequate communication significantly contributes to TD, (3) misalignment between architectural and organizational structures can exacerbate TD accumulation, (4) microservices can rapidly cycle through TD accumulation and resolution, a phenomenon referred to as "microservice architecture technical debt gamble". Finally, we identify a set of fitting strategies for TD management in microservice architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted to Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

Existing APR systems are primarily evaluated in unimodal settings (e.g., SWE-bench). However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal problem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and leveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on visual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and generate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal reasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding and capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key components, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch validation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue report, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code responsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into executable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the visual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of the patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue, providing feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M, and the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o as the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best open-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the base model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances, outperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on incorporating cross-modal reasoning by understanding and capturing visual information to resolve multimodal issues.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional regression testing techniques face significant challenges when applied to autonomous systems due to their dynamic and non-deterministic behaviors, complex multi-modal sensor data, asynchronous distributed architectures, and stringent safety and real-time constraints. Although numerous studies have explored test optimization in traditional software contexts, regression testing optimization specifically for ROSAS remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey systematically reviewing regression testing optimization techniques tailored for ROSAS. We analyze and categorize 122 representative studies into regression test case prioritization, minimization, and selection methods. A structured taxonomy is introduced to clearly illustrate their applicability and limitations within ROSAS contexts. Furthermore, we highlight major challenges specific to regression testing for ROSAS, including effectively prioritizing tests in response to frequent system modifications, efficiently minimizing redundant tests, and difficulty in accurately selecting impacted test cases. Finally, we propose research insights and identify promising future directions, such as leveraging frame-to-vector coverage metrics, multi-source foundation models, and neurosymbolic reasoning to enhance regression testing efficiency and effectiveness. This survey provides a foundational reference and practical roadmap for advancing the state-of-the-art in regression testing optimization for ROSAS.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.</p></details> | 35 pages, 10 figures |

As libraries continuously evolve, it becomes impractical to exhaustively retrain LLMs with new API knowledge. This limitation hampers LLMs from solving programming problems which require newly introduced or privately maintained libraries. Inspired by exploratory programming paradigm in human behavior, we propose ExploraCoder, a training-free framework that empowers LLMs to invoke multiple unseen APIs in code solution by (1) planning a complex problem into several API invocation subtasks, and (2) experimenting with correct API usage at intermediate steps through a novel chain-of-API-exploration. We conduct evaluation on program synthesizing tasks involving complex API interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that ExploraCoder significantly improves performance for models lacking prior API knowledge, achieving absolute increases of up to 11.99% over retrieval-based approaches and 17.28% over pretraining-based methods in pass@10.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities. Experimental results show that LLMs perform significantly worse in the FEA-Bench, highlighting considerable challenges in such repository-level incremental code development.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2, A...</summary><p>V2, Accepted by ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

In Phase 1, students used LCAs to generate code from abstract specifications (From-Scratch approach), achieving only 20% MVP completion. In Phase 2, students adapted existing Minimal Functional Units (MFUs), small, functional code examples, using LCAs, achieving 100% MVP completion. Analysis revealed that the MFU-based approach succeeded by aligning with LCA strengths in pattern modification rather than de novo generation, while providing cognitive scaffolds that enabled students to navigate complex development tasks. The study introduces a dual-scaffolding model combining technical support (MFUs) with pedagogical guidance (structured prompting strategies), demonstrating that effective LCA integration depends less on AI capabilities than on instructional design. These findings offer practical guidance for educators seeking to transform AI tools from sources of frustration into productive learning partners in programming education.</p></details> |  |

While prior studies have explored these problems in general software systems, their interplay in machine learning (ML)-based projects remains largely underexamined. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of community smells and their relationship with SATD in open-source ML projects, analyzing data at the release level. First, we examined the prevalence of ten community smell types across the releases of 155 ML-based systems and found that community smells are widespread, exhibiting distinct distribution patterns across small, medium, and large projects. Second, we detected SATD at the release level and applied statistical analysis to examine its correlation with community smells. Our results showed that certain smells, such as Radio Silence and Organizational Silos, are strongly correlated with higher SATD occurrences. Third, we considered the six identified types of SATD to determine which community smells are most associated with each debt category. Our analysis revealed authority- and communication-related smells often co-occur with persistent code and design debt. Finally, we analyzed how the community smells and SATD evolve over the releases, uncovering project size-dependent trends and shared trajectories. Our findings emphasize the importance of early detection and mitigation of socio-technical issues to maintain the long-term quality and sustainability of ML-based systems.</p></details> |  |

Current security analysis methodologies in vulnerability detection can be categorized into static analysis and dynamic analysis methods.However, these existing traditional vulnerability detection methods predominantly rely on analyzing original contract code, not all smart contracts provide accessible code.We present ETrace, a novel event-driven vulnerability detection framework for smart contracts, which uniquely identifies potential vulnerabilities through LLM-powered trace analysis without requiring source code access. By extracting fine-grained event sequences from transaction logs, the framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive semantic interpreters to reconstruct event analysis through chain-of-thought reasoning. ETrace implements pattern-matching to establish causal links between transaction behavior patterns and known attack behaviors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of ETrace through preliminary experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure.

However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained, semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation. Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, recent research reveals that TPLs have become the largest attack surface for Android apps, where the use of insecure TPLs can compromise both developer and user interests. To mitigate such threats, researchers have proposed various tools to detect TPLs used by apps, supporting further security analyses such as vulnerable TPLs identification. Although existing tools achieve notable library-level TPL detection performance in the presence of obfuscation, they struggle with version-level TPL detection due to a lack of sensitivity to differences between versions. This limitation results in a high version-level false positive rate, significantly increasing the manual workload for security analysts. To resolve this issue, we propose SAD, a TPL detection tool with high version-level detection performance. SAD generates a candidate app class list for each TPL class based on the feature of nodes in class dependency graphs (CDGs). It then identifies the unique corresponding app class for each TPL class by performing class matching based on the similarity of their class summaries. Finally, SAD identifies TPL versions by evaluating the structural similarity of the sub-graph formed by matched classes within the CDGs of the TPL and the app. Extensive evaluation on three datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of SAD and its components. SAD achieves F1 scores of 97.64% and 84.82% for library-level and version-level detection on obfuscated apps, respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art tools. The version-level false positives reported by the best tool is 1.61 times that of SAD. We further evaluate the degree to which TPLs identified by detection tools correspond to actual TPL classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE) 2025</p></details> |

Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention. To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.</p></details> |  |

This challenge becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library. Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates 1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.</p></details> | 29 pages |

Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a library.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, conference paper</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks exhibit several critical limitations: many tasks are overly simplistic, test cases often lack rigor, and end-to-end validation is absent. These issues hinder the accurate assessment of model performance. To address these challenges, we present FrontendBench, a benchmark co-developed by humans and LLMs. FrontendBench categorizes tasks based on code functionality and incorporates interactive test scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of front-end code generation capabilities. The benchmark comprises 148 meticulously crafted prompt-test case pairs spanning five levels of web components, from basic UI elements to complex interactive features. Each task reflects realistic front-end development challenges. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that executes generated code within a sandbox environment and assesses outcomes using predefined test scripts. This framework achieves a 90.54% agreement rate with expert human evaluations, demonstrating high reliability. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on FrontendBench and observe substantial performance disparities in handling real-world front-end tasks. These results highlight FrontendBench as a reliable and scalable benchmark, supporting consistent multimodal evaluation and providing a robust foundation for future research in front-end code generation. Our data and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Defect Taxonomy for Infrastructure as Code: A Replication Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01568v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: As Infrastructure as Code (IaC) becomes standard practice, ensuring the reliability of IaC scripts is essential. Defect taxonomies are valuable tools for this, offering a common language for issues and enabling systematic tracking. A significant prior study developed such a taxonomy, but based it exclusively on the declarative language Puppet. It remained unknown whether this taxonomy applies to programming language-based IaC (PL-IaC) tools like Pulumi, Terraform CDK, and AWS CDK. Aim: We replicated this foundational work to assess the generalizability of the taxonomy across a broader and more diverse landscape. Method: We performed qualitative analysis on 3,364 defect-related commits from 285 open-source PL-IaC repositories (PIPr dataset) to derive a PL-IaC-specific defect taxonomy. We then enhanced the ACID tool, originally developed for the prior study, to automatically classify and analyze defect distributions across an expanded dataset-447 open-source repositories and 94 proprietary projects from VTEX (e-commerce) and Nubank (financial). Results: Our research confirmed the same eight defect categories identified in the original study, with idempotency and security defects appearing infrequently but persistently across projects. Configuration Data defects maintain high frequency in both open-source and proprietary codebases. Conclusions: Our replication supports the generalizability of the original taxonomy, suggesting IaC development challenges surpass organizational boundaries. Configuration Data defects emerge as a persistent high-frequency problem, while idempotency and security defects remain important concerns despite lower frequency. These patterns appear consistent across open-source and proprietary projects, indicating they are fundamental to the IaC paradigm itself, transcending specific tools or project types.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same redzone setting.</p></details> |  |

However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about unauthorized access to users' privacy-sensitive information, which could be further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization. Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android third-party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain. It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data exfiltration and behavior-policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158 widely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30% of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them over-collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly growing body of research has leveraged LLMs to automate various unit testing tasks, demonstrating remarkable performance and significantly reducing manual effort. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based unit testing field, it is challenging for researchers to understand existing achievements, open challenges, and future opportunities. This paper presents the first systematic literature review on the application of LLMs in unit testing until March 2025. We analyze \numpaper{} relevant papers from the perspectives of both unit testing and LLMs. We first categorize existing unit testing tasks that benefit from LLMs, e.g., test generation and oracle generation. We then discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into unit testing research, including model usage, adaptation strategies, and hybrid approaches. We further summarize key challenges that remain unresolved and outline promising directions to guide future research in this area. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the unit testing community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.

| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[CODESYNC: Synchronizing Large Language Models with Dynamic Code Evolution at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16645v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance in software engineering yet face challenges in adapting to continually evolving code knowledge, particularly regarding the frequent updates of third-party library APIs. This limitation, stemming from static pre-training datasets, often results in non-executable code or implementations with suboptimal safety and efficiency. To this end, this paper introduces CODESYNC, a data engine for identifying outdated code patterns and collecting real-time code knowledge updates from Python third-party libraries. Building upon CODESYNC, we develop CODESYNCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' ability to stay synchronized with code evolution, which covers real-world updates for 220 APIs from six Python libraries. Our benchmark offers 3,300 test cases across three evaluation tasks and an update-aware instruction tuning dataset consisting of 2,200 training samples. Extensive experiments on 14 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that they struggle with dynamic code evolution, even with the support of advanced knowledge updating methods (e.g., DPO, ORPO, and SimPO). We believe that our benchmark can offer a strong foundation for the development of more effective methods for real-time code knowledge updating in the future. The experimental code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Lucky-voyage/Code-Sync.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancement Report Approval Prediction: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15098v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancement reports (ERs) serve as a critical communication channel between users and developers, capturing valuable suggestions for software improvement. However, manually processing these reports is resource-intensive, leading to delays and potential loss of valuable insights. To address this challenge, enhancement report approval prediction (ERAP) has emerged as a research focus, leveraging machine learning techniques to automate decision-making. While traditional approaches have employed feature-based classifiers and deep learning models, recent advancements in large language models (LLM) present new opportunities for enhancing prediction accuracy. This study systematically evaluates 18 LLM variants (including BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3, ELECTRA, and XLNet for encoder models; GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1 8B Instruct and DeepSeek-V3 for decoder models) against traditional methods (CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe). Our experiments reveal two key insights: (1) Incorporating creator profiles increases unfine-tuned decoder-only models' overall accuracy by 10.8 percent though it may introduce bias; (2) LoRA fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct further improve performance, reaching 79 percent accuracy and significantly enhancing recall for approved reports (76.1 percent vs. LSTM-GLOVE's 64.1 percent), outperforming traditional methods by 5 percent under strict chronological evaluation and effectively addressing class imbalance issues. These findings establish LLM as a superior solution for ERAP, demonstrating their potential to streamline software maintenance workflows and improve decision-making in real-world development environments. We also investigated and summarized the ER cases where the large models underperformed, providing valuable directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Feature-based Fuzzing Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15088v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing is a powerful software testing technique renowned for its effectiveness in identifying software vulnerabilities. Traditional fuzzing evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features influence fuzzing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to generate programs with configurable, fine-grained program features to enhance fuzzing evaluations. We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Bugs in Data Visualization Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15084v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proc....</summary><p>Proc. ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE</p></details> |
| **[Predicting the Understandability of Computational Notebooks through Code Metrics Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10989v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks are the primary coding tools for data scientists, but their code quality remains understudied and often poor. Given the importance of maintainability and reusability, enhancing code understandability is essential. Traditional methods for assessing understandability typically rely on limited questionnaires or metadata like likes and votes, which may not reflect actual code clarity. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages user opinions from software repositories to assess the understandability of Jupyter notebooks. We conducted a case study using 542,051 Kaggle Jupyter notebooks compiled in the DistilKaggle dataset. To identify user comments related to code understandability, we used a fine-tuned DistilBERT transformer. We then introduced a new metric, i.e., User Opinion Code Understandability (UOCU), based on the number of relevant comments, their upvotes, and notebook views. UOCU proved significantly more effective than prior methods. We further enhanced it by combining UOCU with total upvotes in a hybrid approach. Using this improved metric, we collected 34 notebook-level metrics from 132,723 final notebooks and trained machine learning models to predict understandability. Our best model, a Random Forest classifier, achieved 89% accuracy in classifying the understandability level of notebook code. This work demonstrates the value of user opinion signals and notebook metrics in building scalable, accurate measures of code understandability.</p></details> |  |
| **[OS-Harm: A Benchmark for Measuring Safety of Computer Use Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14866v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees. While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap, we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Performance Constraints for Evaluating and Improving Code Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23471v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to optimize code efficiency. Evaluating their effectiveness and further suggesting optimization opportunities often rely on high-quality tests to demonstrate the performance bottlenecks presented in the program. However, existing approaches rely on a limited set of hand-curated inputs or LLM-generated uninteresting length-stressing tests, failing to reveal more nuanced optimization opportunities. We present WEDGE, a framework for generating performance-stressing input given the program under test. WEDGE synthesizes explicit performance-characterizing constraints in the form of branch conditions to partition the programs' execution space into performance-specific regions. When integrated with the coverage-guided fuzzer, reaching different regions introduces explicit rewards for test generation to explore inefficient implementations. Our evaluation shows that WEDGE introduces a significant slowdown compared to the tests in CodeContests and those claimed to be optimized by existing approaches. From the utility perspective, integrating our tests substantially improves the existing code optimization approaches that rely on test-driven execution feedback. We release PERFFORGE, the performance tests generated by WEDGE, to benchmark future approaches for efficient code generation at https://github.com/UChiSeclab/perfforge.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Idioms: Neural Decompilation With Joint Code and Type Definition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04536v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompilers are important tools for reverse engineers that help them analyze software at a higher level of abstraction than assembly code. Unfortunately, because compilation is lossy, deterministic decompilers produce code that is missing many of the details that make source code readable in the first place, like variable names and types. Neural decompilers, on the other hand, offer the ability to statistically fill in these details. Existing work in neural decompilation, however, suffers from substantial limitations that preclude its use on real code, such as the inability to define composite types, which is essential to fully specify function semantics. In this work, we introduce a new dataset, Realtype, that includes substantially more complicated and realistic types than existing neural decompilation benchmarks, and Idioms, a new neural decompilation approach to finetune any LLM into a neural decompiler capable of generating the appropriate user-defined type definitions alongside the decompiled code. We show that our approach yields state-of-the-art results in neural decompilation. On the most challenging existing benchmark, ExeBench, our model achieves 54.4% accuracy vs. 46.3% for LLM4Decompile and 37.5% for Nova; on Realtype, our model performs at least 95% better.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Issue Retrieval and Verification Enhanced Supplementary Code Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14649v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue reports have been recognized to contain rich information for retrieval-augmented code comment generation. However, how to minimize hallucinations in the generated comments remains significant challenges. In this paper, we propose IsComment, an issue-based LLM retrieval and verification approach for generating method's design rationale, usage directives, and so on as supplementary code comments. We first identify five main types of code supplementary information that issue reports can provide through code-comment-issue analysis. Next, we retrieve issue sentences containing these types of supplementary information and generate candidate code comments. To reduce hallucinations, we filter out those candidate comments that are irrelevant to the code or unverifiable by the issue report, making the code comment generation results more reliable. Our experiments indicate that compared with LLMs, IsComment increases the coverage of manual supplementary comments from 33.6% to 72.2% for ChatGPT, from 35.8% to 88.4% for GPT-4o, and from 35.0% to 86.2% for DeepSeek-V3. Compared with existing work, IsComment can generate richer and more useful supplementary code comments for programming understanding, which is quantitatively evaluated through the MESIA metric on both methods with and without manual code comments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Eleven cities in nine countries will deploy in real conditions products and services fostering climate transition in their local environment. The Climaborough City Platform is being developed to monitor the cities' overall progress towards their climate goals by aggregating historic and real-time data and displaying the results in user-friendly dashboards that will be used by non-technical experts to evaluate the effectiveness of local experimental initiatives, identify those that yield significant impact, and assess the potential consequences of scaling them up to a broader level. In this paper, we explain how we have put in place a low-code/no-code strategy in Climaborough in response to the project's aim to quickly deploy climate dashboards. A low-code strategy is used to accelerate the development of the dashboards.

It shows that LLMs struggle to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities during vulnerability detection. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing LLMs with multi-dimensional vulnerability knowledge distilled from historical vulnerabilities and fixes. We design a novel knowledge-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework Vul-RAG, which improves LLMs with an accuracy increase of 16% - 24% in identifying vulnerable and patched code. Additionally, vulnerability knowledge generated by Vul-RAG can further (1) serve as high-quality explanations to improve manual detection accuracy (from 60% to 77%), and (2) detect 10 previously-unknown bugs in the recent Linux kernel release with 6 assigned CVEs.</p></details> |  |

A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks. We will open-source our codes, data, models, and benchmarks to establish a common foundation for ISA-level code translation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ahmedheakl.github.io/Guaranteed-Guess/</p></details> |

In this work, we present a novel methodology for refactoring Qiskit code using large language models (LLMs). We begin by extracting a taxonomy of migration scenarios from the different sources of official Qiskit documentation (such as release notes), capturing common patterns such as migration of functionality to different modules and deprecated usage. This taxonomy, along with the original Python source code, is provided as input to an LLM, which is then tasked with identifying instances of migration scenarios in the code and suggesting appropriate refactoring solutions. Our approach is designed to address the context length limitations of current LLMs by structuring the input and reasoning process in a targeted, efficient manner. The results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by domain-specific migration knowledge, can effectively assist in automating Qiskit code migration. This work contributes both a set of proven prompts and taxonomy for Qiskit code migration from earlier versions to version 0.46 and a methodology to asses the capabilities of LLMs to assist in the migration of quantum code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review to "Taller Latinoamericano de Ingenier\'ia de Software Cu\'antico" (https://www.ripaisc.net/call-for-papers-tlisc-2025/)</p></details> |

The Surprising Impact of Hybrid Graph Representations on Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14470v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most detrimental code smells, code clones significantly increase software maintenance costs and heighten vulnerability risks, making their detection a critical challenge in software engineering. Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) dominate deep learning-based code clone detection due to their precise syntactic structure representation, but they inherently lack semantic depth. Recent studies address this by enriching AST-based representations with semantic graphs, such as Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). However, the effectiveness of various enriched AST-based representations and their compatibility with different graph-based machine learning techniques remains an open question, warranting further investigation to unlock their full potential in addressing the complexities of code clone detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of AST-based hybrid graph representations in Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based code clone detection. We systematically compare various hybrid representations ((CFG, DFG, Flow-Augmented ASTs (FA-AST)) across multiple GNN architectures. Our experiments reveal that hybrid representations impact GNNs differently: while AST+CFG+DFG consistently enhances accuracy for convolution- and attention-based models (Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT)), FA-AST frequently introduces structural complexity that harms performance. Notably, GMN outperforms others even with standard AST representations, highlighting its superior cross-code similarity detection and reducing the need for enriched structures.</p></details> |  |

Runtime Verification (RV) checks events performed by a system against a formal specification of its intended behaviour, making it highly suitable for ensuring that an autonomous system is obeying its specification at runtime. Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is a process algebra usually used in static verification, which captures behaviour as a trace of events, making it useful for RV as well. Further, CSP has more recently been used to specify autonomous and robotic systems. Though CSP is supported by two extant model checkers, so far it has no RV tool. This paper presents Varanus, an RV tool that monitors a system against an oracle built from a CSP specification. This approach enables the reuse without modifications of a specification that was built, e.g during the system's design. We describe the tool, apply it to a simulated autonomous robotic rover inspecting a nuclear waste store, empirically comparing its performance to two other RV tools using different languages, and demonstrate how it can detect violations of the specification. Varanus can synthesise a monitor from a CSP process in roughly linear time, with respect to the number of states and transitions in the model; and checks each event in roughly constant time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems (TAROS) 2025</p></details> |

| **[How to Elicit Explainability Requirements? A Comparison of Interviews, Focus Groups, and Surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23684v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software systems grow increasingly complex, explainability has become a crucial non-functional requirement for transparency, user trust, and regulatory compliance. Eliciting explainability requirements is challenging, as different methods capture varying levels of detail and structure. This study examines the efficiency and effectiveness of three commonly used elicitation methods - focus groups, interviews, and online surveys - while also assessing the role of taxonomy usage in structuring and improving the elicitation process. We conducted a case study at a large German IT consulting company, utilizing a web-based personnel management software. A total of two focus groups, 18 interviews, and an online survey with 188 participants were analyzed. The results show that interviews were the most efficient, capturing the highest number of distinct needs per participant per time spent. Surveys collected the most explanation needs overall but had high redundancy. Delayed taxonomy introduction resulted in a greater number and diversity of needs, suggesting that a two-phase approach is beneficial. Based on our findings, we recommend a hybrid approach combining surveys and interviews to balance efficiency and coverage. Future research should explore how automation can support elicitation and how taxonomies can be better integrated into different methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the research track of the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE 2025)</p></details> |

Despite this, these practices are implicit or even explicit evaluation criteria of typical software engineering conferences and journals. In this pragmatic, educational-first document, we want to provide guidance to those who may feel overwhelmed or confused by writing ESE papers, but also those more experienced who still might find an opinionated collection of writing advice useful. The primary audience we had in mind for this paper were our own BSc, MSc, and PhD students, but also students of others. Our documented advice therefore reflects a subjective and personal vision of writing ESE papers. By no means do we claim to be fully objective, generalizable, or representative of the whole discipline. With that being said, writing papers in this way has worked pretty well for us so far. We hope that this guide can at least partially do the same for others.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes (SEN)</p></details> |

The course has undergone fundamental changes since 2020 to make the teaching approach more student-centred and flexible. As many universities abandoned having face-to-face exams at the end of the semester, authentic assessments now play an even more important role than before. This makes assessment of students' work even more challenging, especially if we are dealing with large cohorts of students. The complexity is not only in dealing with diversity in the student cohorts when elaborating the assessment tasks, but also in being able to provide feedback and marks in a timely and fairly. We report our lessons learned, which might provide useful insights for teaching Agile/Scrum concepts to undergraduate and postgraduate students. We also analyse what course structure might be effective to support a blended learning approach, as well as what could be a reasonable structure of online assessments, to keep them both authentic and scalable for large cohorts of students.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Quality Assessment of Python Tests Generated by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14297v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manual generation of test scripts is a time-intensive, costly, and error-prone process, indicating the value of automated solutions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in this domain, leveraging their extensive knowledge to produce test code more efficiently. This study investigates the quality of Python test code generated by three LLMs: GPT-4o, Amazon Q, and LLama 3.3. We evaluate the structural reliability of test suites generated under two distinct prompt contexts: Text2Code (T2C) and Code2Code (C2C). Our analysis includes the identification of errors and test smells, with a focus on correlating these issues to inadequate design patterns. Our findings reveal that most test suites generated by the LLMs contained at least one error or test smell. Assertion errors were the most common, comprising 64% of all identified errors, while the test smell Lack of Cohesion of Test Cases was the most frequently detected (41%). Prompt context significantly influenced test quality; textual prompts with detailed instructions often yielded tests with fewer errors but a higher incidence of test smells. Among the evaluated LLMs, GPT-4o produced the fewest errors in both contexts (10% in C2C and 6% in T2C), whereas Amazon Q had the highest error rates (19% in C2C and 28% in T2C). For test smells, Amazon Q had fewer detections in the C2C context (9%), while LLama 3.3 performed best in the T2C context (10%). Additionally, we observed a strong relationship between specific errors, such as assertion or indentation issues, and test case cohesion smells. These findings demonstrate opportunities for improving the quality of test generation by LLMs and highlight the need for future research to explore optimized generation scenarios and better prompt engineering strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025 edition</p></details> |

| **[Dissecting the SWE-Bench Leaderboards: Profiling Submitters and Architectures of LLM- and Agent-Based Repair Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17208v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reassessing Code Authorship Attribution in the Era of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17120v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of Code Stylometry, and in particular Code Authorship Attribution (CAA), aims to analyze coding styles to identify the authors of code samples. CAA is crucial in cybersecurity and software forensics for addressing, detecting plagiarism, and supporting criminal prosecutions. However, CAA is a complex and error prone task, due to the need for recognizing nuanced relationships between coding patterns. This challenge is compounded in large software systems with numerous authors due to the subtle variability of patterns that signify the coding style of one author among many. Given the challenges related to this task, researchers have proposed and studied automated approaches that rely upon classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. However, such techniques have historically relied upon hand-crafted features, and due to the often intricate interaction of different features (e.g., formatting, etc.), have key limitations in properly characterizing authorship, and are sensitive to adversarial code perturbations. Recently, transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have shown remarkable efficacy across a range of software engineering tasks, and in the authorship attribution on natural language in the NLP domain. However, their effectiveness in CAA is not well understood. As such, we conduct the first extensive empirical study applying two larger state-of-the-art code LMs, and five smaller code LMs to the task of CAA to 6 diverse datasets that encompass 12k code snippets written by 463 developers. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis of our studied models' performance on CAA using established machine learning interpretability techniques. The results of our analysis illustrate important findings that illuminate the behavior of LMs in understanding stylometric code patterns during the task of CAA, and point towards important directions for future work.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Software Fairness Testing in Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17095v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software testing ensures that a system functions correctly, meets specified requirements, and maintains high quality. As artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) technologies become integral to software systems, testing has evolved to address their unique complexities. A critical advancement in this space is fairness testing, which identifies and mitigates biases in AI applications to promote ethical and equitable outcomes. Despite extensive academic research on fairness testing, including test input generation, test oracle identification, and component testing, practical adoption remains limited. Industry practitioners often lack clear guidelines and effective tools to integrate fairness testing into real-world AI development. This study investigates how software professionals test AI-powered systems for fairness through interviews with 22 practitioners working on AI and ML projects. Our findings highlight a significant gap between theoretical fairness concepts and industry practice. While fairness definitions continue to evolve, they remain difficult for practitioners to interpret and apply. The absence of industry-aligned fairness testing tools further complicates adoption, necessitating research into practical, accessible solutions. Key challenges include data quality and diversity, time constraints, defining effective metrics, and ensuring model interoperability. These insights emphasize the need to bridge academic advancements with actionable strategies and tools, enabling practitioners to systematically address fairness in AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavior Driven Development for 3D Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17057v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer 3D games are complex software environments that require novel testing processes to ensure high-quality standards. The Intelligent Verification/Validation for Extended Reality Based Systems (iv4XR) framework addresses this need by enabling the implementation of autonomous agents to automate game testing scenarios. This framework facilitates the automation of regression test cases for complex 3D games like Space Engineers. Nevertheless, the technical expertise required to define test scripts using iv4XR can constrain seamless collaboration between developers and testers. This paper reports how integrating a Behavior-driven Development (BDD) approach with the iv4XR framework allows the industrial company behind Space Engineers to automate regression testing. The success of this industrial collaboration has inspired the iv4XR team to integrate the BDD approach to improve the automation of play-testing for the experimental 3D game LabRecruits. Furthermore, the iv4XR framework has been extended with tactical programming to enable the automation of long-play test scenarios in Space Engineers. These results underscore the versatility of the iv4XR framework in supporting diverse testing approaches while showcasing how BDD empowers users to create, manage, and execute automated game tests using comprehensive and human-readable statements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Quantum Eigensolver Algorithms With Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13587v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore accelerating Hamiltonian ground state energy calculation on NISQ devices. We suggest using search-based methods together with machine learning to accelerate quantum algorithms, exemplified in the Quantum Eigensolver use case. We trained two small models on classically mined data from systems with up to 16 qubits, using XGBoost's Python regressor. We evaluated our preliminary approach on 20-, 24- and 28-qubit systems by optimising the Eigensolver's hyperparameters. These models predict hyperparameter values, leading to a 0.12% reduction in error when tested on 28-qubit systems. However, due to inconclusive results with 20- and 24-qubit systems, we suggest further examination of the training data based on Hamiltonian characteristics. In future work, we plan to train machine learning models to optimise other aspects or subroutines of quantum algorithm execution beyond its hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PinChecker: Identifying Unsound Safe Abstractions of Rust Pinning APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14500v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pinning APIs of Rust language guarantee memory location stability for self-referential and asynchronous constructs, as long as used according to the pinning API contract. Rust ensures violations of such contract are impossible in regular safe code, but not in unsafe code where unsafe pinning APIs can be used. Library authors can encapsulate arbitrary unsafe code within regular library functions. These can be freely called in higher-level code without explicit warnings. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze library functions to rule out pinning API contract violations. Unfortunately, such testing relies on manual analysis by library authors, which is ineffective. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, given a library, attempts to construct programs that intentionally breach the pinning API contract by chaining library function calls, thereby verifying their soundness. We introduce RPIL, a novel intermediate representation that models functions' critical behaviors pertaining to pinning APIs. We implement PinChecker, a synthesis-driven violation detection tool guided by RPIL, which automatically synthesizes bug-revealing programs. Our experiments on 13 popular Rust libraries from crates.io found 2 confirmed bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Optimization for Software Engineering: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16878v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing, particularly in the area of quantum optimization, is steadily progressing toward practical applications, supported by an expanding range of hardware platforms and simulators. While Software Engineering (SE) optimization has a strong foundation, which is exemplified by the active Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) community and numerous classical optimization methods, the growing complexity of modern software systems and their engineering processes demands innovative solutions. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focuses specifically on studying the literature that applies quantum or quantum-inspired algorithms to solve classical SE optimization problems. We examine 77 primary studies selected from an initial pool of 2083 publications obtained through systematic searches of six digital databases using carefully crafted search strings. Our findings reveal concentrated research efforts in areas such as SE operations and software testing, while exposing significant gaps across other SE activities. Additionally, the SLR uncovers relevant works published outside traditional SE venues, underscoring the necessity of this comprehensive review. Overall, our study provides a broad overview of the research landscape, empowering the SBSE community to leverage quantum advancements in addressing next-generation SE challenges.</p></details> |  |

These models pose challenges in diagnosing failures, tracing anomalies, and maintaining transparency, with current manual testing methods being inefficient and labor-intensive. This vision paper presents a methodology that integrates explainability, transparency, and interpretability into V&V processes. We propose refining V&V requirements through literature reviews and stakeholder input, generating explainable test scenarios via large language models (LLMs), and enabling real-time validation in simulation environments. Our framework includes test oracle, explanation generation, and a test chatbot, with empirical studies planned to evaluate improvements in diagnostic efficiency and transparency. Our goal is to streamline V&V, reduce resources, and build user trust in autonomous technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to be published at SE4ADS</p></details> |

A case study is used to illustrate real-world applications, emphasizing the need for innovative testing solutions.

But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Satisfiability Checking of String Requirements by Consistent Data and Checker Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16639v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements over strings, commonly represented using natural language (NL), are particularly relevant for software systems due to their heavy reliance on string data manipulation. While individual requirements can usually be analyzed manually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL requirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers) may efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical limitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal constraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings is less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies the satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive a satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to generate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used to validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the performance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural language into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for Python-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a consistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements, leading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain cases compared to baselines without generated checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025 conference</p></details> |

However, the increasing complexity of the ADAS makes autonomous vehicles (AVs) more exposed to attacks and accidental faults. In this paper, we evaluate the resilience of a widely used ADAS against safety-critical attacks that target perception inputs. Various safety mechanisms are simulated to assess their impact on mitigating attacks and enhancing ADAS resilience. Experimental results highlight the importance of timely intervention by human drivers and automated safety mechanisms in preventing accidents in both driving and lateral directions and the need to resolve conflicts among safety interventions to enhance system resilience and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, To appear in the 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AI-Driven Tools in Modern Software Quality Assurance: An Assessment of Benefits, Challenges, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16586v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional quality assurance (QA) methods face significant challenges in addressing the complexity, scale, and rapid iteration cycles of modern software systems and are strained by limited resources available, leading to substantial costs associated with poor quality. The object of this research is the Quality Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, test case generation, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3% flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically identical coverage, "black box" nature and lack of explainability from state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies, considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate verification methodologies.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SWE-Dev: Evaluating and Training Autonomous Feature-Driven Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16975v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capability in diverse software engineering tasks, e.g. code completion, bug fixing, and document generation. However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases, remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests. This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its high-quality training data.

| **[AlphaTrans: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Approach for Repository-Level Code Translation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Thermal Modeling and Optimal Allocation of Avionics Safety-critical Tasks on Heterogeneous MPSoCs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22214v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoC) can deliver high performance needed in many industrial domains, including aerospace. However, their high power consumption, combined with avionics safety standards, brings new thermal management challenges. This paper investigates techniques for offline thermal-aware allocation of periodic tasks on heterogeneous MPSoCs running at a fixed clock frequency, as required in avionics. The goal is to find the assignment of tasks to (i) cores and (ii) temporal isolation windows while minimizing the MPSoC temperature. To achieve that, we propose and analyze three power models, and integrate them within several novel optimization approaches based on heuristics, a black-box optimizer, and Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We perform the experimental evaluation on three popular MPSoC platforms (NXP i.MX8QM MEK, NXP i.MX8QM Ixora, NVIDIA TX2) and observe a difference of up to 5.5{\deg}C among the tested methods (corresponding to a 22% reduction w.r.t. the ambient temperature). We also show that our method, integrating the empirical power model with the ILP, outperforms the other methods on all tested platforms.</p></details> | Accepted version |
| **[Evaluating the Use of LLMs for Documentation to Code Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16440v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to 71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing, such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight specific error patterns for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00.

| **[Chaos Engineering: A Multi-Vocal Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01416v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Organizations, particularly medium and large enterprises, typically rely heavily on complex, distributed systems to deliver critical services and products. However, the growing complexity of these systems poses challenges in ensuring service availability, performance, and reliability. Traditional resilience testing methods often fail to capture the intricate interactions and failure modes of modern systems. Chaos Engineering addresses these challenges by proactively testing how systems in production behave under turbulent conditions, allowing developers to uncover and resolve potential issues before they escalate into outages. Though chaos engineering has received growing attention from researchers and practitioners alike, we observed a lack of reviews that synthesize insights from both academic and grey literature. Hence, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) on chaos engineering to address this research gap by systematically analyzing 96 academic and grey literature sources published between January 2016 and April 2024. We first used the chosen sources to derive a unified definition of chaos engineering and to identify key functionalities, components, and adoption drivers. We also developed a taxonomy for chaos engineering platforms and compared the relevant tools using it. Finally, we analyzed the current state of chaos engineering research and identified several open research issues.</p></details> |  |

Existing APR systems are primarily evaluated in unimodal settings (e.g., SWE-bench). However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal problem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and leveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on visual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and generate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal reasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding and capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key components, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch validation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue report, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code responsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into executable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the visual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of the patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue, providing feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M, and the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o as the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best open-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the base model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances, outperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on incorporating cross-modal reasoning by understanding and capturing visual information to resolve multimodal issues.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional regression testing techniques face significant challenges when applied to autonomous systems due to their dynamic and non-deterministic behaviors, complex multi-modal sensor data, asynchronous distributed architectures, and stringent safety and real-time constraints. Although numerous studies have explored test optimization in traditional software contexts, regression testing optimization specifically for ROSAS remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey systematically reviewing regression testing optimization techniques tailored for ROSAS. We analyze and categorize 122 representative studies into regression test case prioritization, minimization, and selection methods. A structured taxonomy is introduced to clearly illustrate their applicability and limitations within ROSAS contexts. Furthermore, we highlight major challenges specific to regression testing for ROSAS, including effectively prioritizing tests in response to frequent system modifications, efficiently minimizing redundant tests, and difficulty in accurately selecting impacted test cases. Finally, we propose research insights and identify promising future directions, such as leveraging frame-to-vector coverage metrics, multi-source foundation models, and neurosymbolic reasoning to enhance regression testing efficiency and effectiveness. This survey provides a foundational reference and practical roadmap for advancing the state-of-the-art in regression testing optimization for ROSAS.</p></details> |  |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |

Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on.

Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.</p></details> | 63 pages, 11 figures |

LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This vision paper presents a methodology that integrates explainability, transparency, and interpretability into V&V processes. We propose refining V&V requirements through literature reviews and stakeholder input, generating explainable test scenarios via large language models (LLMs), and enabling real-time validation in simulation environments.

But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Satisfiability Checking of String Requirements by Consistent Data and Checker Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16639v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements over strings, commonly represented using natural language (NL), are particularly relevant for software systems due to their heavy reliance on string data manipulation. While individual requirements can usually be analyzed manually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL requirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers) may efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical limitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal constraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings is less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies the satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive a satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to generate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used to validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the performance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural language into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for Python-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a consistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements, leading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain cases compared to baselines without generated checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025 conference</p></details> |

The object of this research is the Quality Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, test case generation, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3% flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically identical coverage, "black box" nature and lack of explainability from state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies, considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate verification methodologies.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |

However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases, remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests. This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its high-quality training data.

Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |

First, we demonstrate the reliability of LLMs in topic extraction, achieving 91% accuracy through five-shot prompting and non-informative review filtering. Then, we apply this method to the informative reviews, identify the top 10 user-discussed topics (e.g., AI Performance, Content Quality, and Content Policy & Censorship) and analyze the key challenges and emerging opportunities. Finally, we examine how these topics evolve over time, offering insight into shifting user expectations and engagement patterns with Gen-AI apps.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to 71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing, such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight specific error patterns for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

CAA is crucial in cybersecurity and software forensics for addressing, detecting plagiarism, and supporting criminal prosecutions. However, CAA is a complex and error prone task, due to the need for recognizing nuanced relationships between coding patterns. This challenge is compounded in large software systems with numerous authors due to the subtle variability of patterns that signify the coding style of one author among many. Given the challenges related to this task, researchers have proposed and studied automated approaches that rely upon classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. However, such techniques have historically relied upon hand-crafted features, and due to the often intricate interaction of different features (e.g., formatting, etc.), have key limitations in properly characterizing authorship, and are sensitive to adversarial code perturbations. Recently, transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have shown remarkable efficacy across a range of software engineering tasks, and in the authorship attribution on natural language in the NLP domain. However, their effectiveness in CAA is not well understood. As such, we conduct the first extensive empirical study applying two larger state-of-the-art code LMs, and five smaller code LMs to the task of CAA to 6 diverse datasets that encompass 12k code snippets written by 463 developers. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis of our studied models' performance on CAA using established machine learning interpretability techniques. The results of our analysis illustrate important findings that illuminate the behavior of LMs in understanding stylometric code patterns during the task of CAA, and point towards important directions for future work.</p></details> | 12 pages |

As artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) technologies become integral to software systems, testing has evolved to address their unique complexities. A critical advancement in this space is fairness testing, which identifies and mitigates biases in AI applications to promote ethical and equitable outcomes. Despite extensive academic research on fairness testing, including test input generation, test oracle identification, and component testing, practical adoption remains limited. Industry practitioners often lack clear guidelines and effective tools to integrate fairness testing into real-world AI development. This study investigates how software professionals test AI-powered systems for fairness through interviews with 22 practitioners working on AI and ML projects. Our findings highlight a significant gap between theoretical fairness concepts and industry practice. While fairness definitions continue to evolve, they remain difficult for practitioners to interpret and apply. The absence of industry-aligned fairness testing tools further complicates adoption, necessitating research into practical, accessible solutions. Key challenges include data quality and diversity, time constraints, defining effective metrics, and ensuring model interoperability. These insights emphasize the need to bridge academic advancements with actionable strategies and tools, enabling practitioners to systematically address fairness in AI systems.</p></details> |  |

We suggest using search-based methods together with machine learning to accelerate quantum algorithms, exemplified in the Quantum Eigensolver use case. We trained two small models on classically mined data from systems with up to 16 qubits, using XGBoost's Python regressor. We evaluated our preliminary approach on 20-, 24- and 28-qubit systems by optimising the Eigensolver's hyperparameters. These models predict hyperparameter values, leading to a 0.12% reduction in error when tested on 28-qubit systems. However, due to inconclusive results with 20- and 24-qubit systems, we suggest further examination of the training data based on Hamiltonian characteristics. In future work, we plan to train machine learning models to optimise other aspects or subroutines of quantum algorithm execution beyond its hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

Rust ensures violations of such contract are impossible in regular safe code, but not in unsafe code where unsafe pinning APIs can be used. Library authors can encapsulate arbitrary unsafe code within regular library functions. These can be freely called in higher-level code without explicit warnings. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze library functions to rule out pinning API contract violations. Unfortunately, such testing relies on manual analysis by library authors, which is ineffective. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, given a library, attempts to construct programs that intentionally breach the pinning API contract by chaining library function calls, thereby verifying their soundness. We introduce RPIL, a novel intermediate representation that models functions' critical behaviors pertaining to pinning APIs. We implement PinChecker, a synthesis-driven violation detection tool guided by RPIL, which automatically synthesizes bug-revealing programs. Our experiments on 13 popular Rust libraries from crates.io found 2 confirmed bugs.</p></details> |  |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |

Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.</p></details> | 63 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17125v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization of sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal compliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Behavior Driven Development for 3D Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17057v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer 3D games are complex software environments that require novel testing processes to ensure high-quality standards. The Intelligent Verification/Validation for Extended Reality Based Systems (iv4XR) framework addresses this need by enabling the implementation of autonomous agents to automate game testing scenarios. This framework facilitates the automation of regression test cases for complex 3D games like Space Engineers. Nevertheless, the technical expertise required to define test scripts using iv4XR can constrain seamless collaboration between developers and testers. This paper reports how integrating a Behavior-driven Development (BDD) approach with the iv4XR framework allows the industrial company behind Space Engineers to automate regression testing. The success of this industrial collaboration has inspired the iv4XR team to integrate the BDD approach to improve the automation of play-testing for the experimental 3D game LabRecruits. Furthermore, the iv4XR framework has been extended with tactical programming to enable the automation of long-play test scenarios in Space Engineers. These results underscore the versatility of the iv4XR framework in supporting diverse testing approaches while showcasing how BDD empowers users to create, manage, and execute automated game tests using comprehensive and human-readable statements.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge in achieving adequate explanations is the elicitation of individual explanation needs, as it may be subject to severe hypothetical or confirmation biases. To address these challenges, we aim to establish user-based indicators concerning user behavior or system events that can be captured at runtime to determine when a need for explanations arises. In this work, we conducted explorative research in form of an online study to collect self-reported indicators that could indicate a need for explanation. We compiled a catalog containing 17 relevant indicators concerning user behavior, 8 indicators concerning system events and 14 indicators concerning emotional states or physical reactions. We also analyze the relationships between these indicators and different types of need for explanation. The established indicators can be used in the elicitation process through prototypes, as well as after publication to gather requirements from already deployed applications using telemetry and usage data. Moreover, these indicators can be used to trigger explanations at appropriate moments during the runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the research track of the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE 2025)</p></details> |

| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

While Software Engineering (SE) optimization has a strong foundation, which is exemplified by the active Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) community and numerous classical optimization methods, the growing complexity of modern software systems and their engineering processes demands innovative solutions. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focuses specifically on studying the literature that applies quantum or quantum-inspired algorithms to solve classical SE optimization problems. We examine 77 primary studies selected from an initial pool of 2083 publications obtained through systematic searches of six digital databases using carefully crafted search strings. Our findings reveal concentrated research efforts in areas such as SE operations and software testing, while exposing significant gaps across other SE activities. Additionally, the SLR uncovers relevant works published outside traditional SE venues, underscoring the necessity of this comprehensive review. Overall, our study provides a broad overview of the research landscape, empowering the SBSE community to leverage quantum advancements in addressing next-generation SE challenges.</p></details> |  |

To address this, FM providers introduced tool calling-triggering a proliferation of frameworks with distinct tool interfaces. In late 2024, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize this tool ecosystem, which has become the de facto standard with over eight million weekly SDK downloads. Despite its adoption, MCP's AI-driven, non-deterministic control flow introduces new risks to sustainability, security, and maintainability, warranting closer examination. Towards this end, we present the first large-scale empirical study of MCP servers. Using state-of-the-art health metrics and a hybrid analysis pipeline, combining a general-purpose static analysis tool with an MCP-specific scanner, we evaluate 1,899 open-source MCP servers to assess their health, security, and maintainability. Despite MCP servers demonstrating strong health metrics, we identify eight distinct vulnerabilities - only three overlapping with traditional software vulnerabilities. Additionally, 7.2% of servers contain general vulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning. Regarding maintainability, while 66% exhibit code smells, 14.4% contain nine bug patterns overlapping with traditional open-source software projects. These findings highlight the need for MCP-specific vulnerability detection techniques while reaffirming the value of traditional analysis and refactoring practices.</p></details> |  |

But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025.

| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Satisfiability Checking of String Requirements by Consistent Data and Checker Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16639v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements over strings, commonly represented using natural language (NL), are particularly relevant for software systems due to their heavy reliance on string data manipulation. While individual requirements can usually be analyzed manually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL requirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers) may efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical limitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal constraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings is less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies the satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive a satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to generate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used to validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the performance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural language into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for Python-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a consistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements, leading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain cases compared to baselines without generated checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025 conference</p></details> |

The object of this research is the Quality Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, test case generation, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3% flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically identical coverage, "black box" nature and lack of explainability from state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies, considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate verification methodologies.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

We exploit the modular structure of the plant to be controlled, given as a set of labelled transition systems (LTS), to mitigate state explosion that monolithic approaches to synthesis are prone to. Maximally permissive safe controllers are iteratively built for subsets of the plant LTSs by solving weaker control problems. Observational synthesis equivalence is used to reduce the size of the controlled subset of the plant by abstracting away local events. The result of synthesis is also compositional, a set of controllers that when run in parallel ensure the LTL goal. We implement synthesis in the MTSA tool for an expressive subset of LTL, GR(1), and show it computes solutions to that can be up to 1000 times larger than those that the monolithic approach can solve.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CAV25</p></details> |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |

However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases, remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests. This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its high-quality training data.

Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |

Despite widespread adoption, little is known about how end users perceive and evaluate these Gen-AI functionalities in practice. In this work, we conduct a user-centered analysis of 676,066 reviews from 173 Gen-AI apps on the Google Play Store. We introduce a four-phase methodology, SARA (Selection, Acquisition, Refinement, and Analysis), that enables the systematic extraction of user insights using prompt-based LLM techniques. First, we demonstrate the reliability of LLMs in topic extraction, achieving 91% accuracy through five-shot prompting and non-informative review filtering. Then, we apply this method to the informative reviews, identify the top 10 user-discussed topics (e.g., AI Performance, Content Quality, and Content Policy & Censorship) and analyze the key challenges and emerging opportunities. Finally, we examine how these topics evolve over time, offering insight into shifting user expectations and engagement patterns with Gen-AI apps.

However, their high power consumption, combined with avionics safety standards, brings new thermal management challenges. This paper investigates techniques for offline thermal-aware allocation of periodic tasks on heterogeneous MPSoCs running at a fixed clock frequency, as required in avionics. The goal is to find the assignment of tasks to (i) cores and (ii) temporal isolation windows while minimizing the MPSoC temperature. To achieve that, we propose and analyze three power models, and integrate them within several novel optimization approaches based on heuristics, a black-box optimizer, and Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We perform the experimental evaluation on three popular MPSoC platforms (NXP i.MX8QM MEK, NXP i.MX8QM Ixora, NVIDIA TX2) and observe a difference of up to 5.5{\deg}C among the tested methods (corresponding to a 22% reduction w.r.t. the ambient temperature). We also show that our method, integrating the empirical power model with the ILP, outperforms the other methods on all tested platforms.</p></details> | Accepted version |

We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to 71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing, such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight specific error patterns for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

However, the growing complexity of these systems poses challenges in ensuring service availability, performance, and reliability. Traditional resilience testing methods often fail to capture the intricate interactions and failure modes of modern systems. Chaos Engineering addresses these challenges by proactively testing how systems in production behave under turbulent conditions, allowing developers to uncover and resolve potential issues before they escalate into outages. Though chaos engineering has received growing attention from researchers and practitioners alike, we observed a lack of reviews that synthesize insights from both academic and grey literature. Hence, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) on chaos engineering to address this research gap by systematically analyzing 96 academic and grey literature sources published between January 2016 and April 2024. We first used the chosen sources to derive a unified definition of chaos engineering and to identify key functionalities, components, and adoption drivers. We also developed a taxonomy for chaos engineering platforms and compared the relevant tools using it. Finally, we analyzed the current state of chaos engineering research and identified several open research issues.</p></details> |  |

Code Technical Debt (Code TD) prediction has gained significant attention in recent software engineering research. However, no standardized approach to Code TD prediction fully captures the factors influencing its evolution. Objective. Our study aims to assess the impact of time-dependent models and seasonal effects on Code TD prediction. It evaluates such models against widely used Machine Learning models, also considering the influence of seasonality on prediction performance. Methods. We trained 11 prediction models with 31 Java open-source projects. To assess their performance, we predicted future observations of the SQALE index. To evaluate the practical usability of our TD forecasting model and its impact on practitioners, we surveyed 23 software engineering professionals. Results. Our study confirms the benefits of time-dependent techniques, with the ARIMAX model outperforming the others. Seasonal effects improved predictive performance, though the impact remained modest. \ReviewerA{ARIMAX/SARIMAX models demonstrated to provide well-balanced long-term forecasts. The survey highlighted strong industry interest in short- to medium-term TD forecasts. Conclusions. Our findings support using techniques that capture time dependence in historical software metric data, particularly for Code TD. Effectively addressing this evidence requires adopting methods that account for temporal patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, these quality attributes are notably vulnerable to technical debt (TD). Few studies address TD in microservice systems, particularly on a large scale. This research explores how TD manifests in a large-scale microservice-based industrial system. The research is based on a mixed-method case study of a project including over 100 microservices and serving over 15k locations. Results are collected via a quantitative method based static code analyzers combined with qualitative insights derived from a focus group discussion with the development team and a follow-up interview with the lead architect of the case study system. Results show that (1) simple static source code analysis can be an efficient and effective entry point for holistic TD discovery, (2) inadequate communication significantly contributes to TD, (3) misalignment between architectural and organizational structures can exacerbate TD accumulation, (4) microservices can rapidly cycle through TD accumulation and resolution, a phenomenon referred to as "microservice architecture technical debt gamble". Finally, we identify a set of fitting strategies for TD management in microservice architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted to Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

Existing APR systems are primarily evaluated in unimodal settings (e.g., SWE-bench). However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal problem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and leveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on visual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and generate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal reasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding and capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key components, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch validation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue report, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code responsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into executable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the visual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of the patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue, providing feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M, and the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o as the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best open-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the base model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances, outperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on incorporating cross-modal reasoning by understanding and capturing visual information to resolve multimodal issues.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional regression testing techniques face significant challenges when applied to autonomous systems due to their dynamic and non-deterministic behaviors, complex multi-modal sensor data, asynchronous distributed architectures, and stringent safety and real-time constraints. Although numerous studies have explored test optimization in traditional software contexts, regression testing optimization specifically for ROSAS remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey systematically reviewing regression testing optimization techniques tailored for ROSAS. We analyze and categorize 122 representative studies into regression test case prioritization, minimization, and selection methods. A structured taxonomy is introduced to clearly illustrate their applicability and limitations within ROSAS contexts. Furthermore, we highlight major challenges specific to regression testing for ROSAS, including effectively prioritizing tests in response to frequent system modifications, efficiently minimizing redundant tests, and difficulty in accurately selecting impacted test cases. Finally, we propose research insights and identify promising future directions, such as leveraging frame-to-vector coverage metrics, multi-source foundation models, and neurosymbolic reasoning to enhance regression testing efficiency and effectiveness. This survey provides a foundational reference and practical roadmap for advancing the state-of-the-art in regression testing optimization for ROSAS.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.</p></details> | 35 pages, 10 figures |

As libraries continuously evolve, it becomes impractical to exhaustively retrain LLMs with new API knowledge. This limitation hampers LLMs from solving programming problems which require newly introduced or privately maintained libraries. Inspired by exploratory programming paradigm in human behavior, we propose ExploraCoder, a training-free framework that empowers LLMs to invoke multiple unseen APIs in code solution by (1) planning a complex problem into several API invocation subtasks, and (2) experimenting with correct API usage at intermediate steps through a novel chain-of-API-exploration. We conduct evaluation on program synthesizing tasks involving complex API interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that ExploraCoder significantly improves performance for models lacking prior API knowledge, achieving absolute increases of up to 11.99% over retrieval-based approaches and 17.28% over pretraining-based methods in pass@10.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities. Experimental results show that LLMs perform significantly worse in the FEA-Bench, highlighting considerable challenges in such repository-level incremental code development.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2, A...</summary><p>V2, Accepted by ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

In Phase 1, students used LCAs to generate code from abstract specifications (From-Scratch approach), achieving only 20% MVP completion. In Phase 2, students adapted existing Minimal Functional Units (MFUs), small, functional code examples, using LCAs, achieving 100% MVP completion. Analysis revealed that the MFU-based approach succeeded by aligning with LCA strengths in pattern modification rather than de novo generation, while providing cognitive scaffolds that enabled students to navigate complex development tasks. The study introduces a dual-scaffolding model combining technical support (MFUs) with pedagogical guidance (structured prompting strategies), demonstrating that effective LCA integration depends less on AI capabilities than on instructional design. These findings offer practical guidance for educators seeking to transform AI tools from sources of frustration into productive learning partners in programming education.</p></details> |  |

While prior studies have explored these problems in general software systems, their interplay in machine learning (ML)-based projects remains largely underexamined. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of community smells and their relationship with SATD in open-source ML projects, analyzing data at the release level. First, we examined the prevalence of ten community smell types across the releases of 155 ML-based systems and found that community smells are widespread, exhibiting distinct distribution patterns across small, medium, and large projects. Second, we detected SATD at the release level and applied statistical analysis to examine its correlation with community smells. Our results showed that certain smells, such as Radio Silence and Organizational Silos, are strongly correlated with higher SATD occurrences. Third, we considered the six identified types of SATD to determine which community smells are most associated with each debt category. Our analysis revealed authority- and communication-related smells often co-occur with persistent code and design debt. Finally, we analyzed how the community smells and SATD evolve over the releases, uncovering project size-dependent trends and shared trajectories. Our findings emphasize the importance of early detection and mitigation of socio-technical issues to maintain the long-term quality and sustainability of ML-based systems.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reassessing Code Authorship Attribution in the Era of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17120v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of Code Stylometry, and in particular Code Authorship Attribution (CAA), aims to analyze coding styles to identify the authors of code samples. CAA is crucial in cybersecurity and software forensics for addressing, detecting plagiarism, and supporting criminal prosecutions. However, CAA is a complex and error prone task, due to the need for recognizing nuanced relationships between coding patterns. This challenge is compounded in large software systems with numerous authors due to the subtle variability of patterns that signify the coding style of one author among many. Given the challenges related to this task, researchers have proposed and studied automated approaches that rely upon classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. However, such techniques have historically relied upon hand-crafted features, and due to the often intricate interaction of different features (e.g., formatting, etc.), have key limitations in properly characterizing authorship, and are sensitive to adversarial code perturbations. Recently, transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have shown remarkable efficacy across a range of software engineering tasks, and in the authorship attribution on natural language in the NLP domain. However, their effectiveness in CAA is not well understood. As such, we conduct the first extensive empirical study applying two larger state-of-the-art code LMs, and five smaller code LMs to the task of CAA to 6 diverse datasets that encompass 12k code snippets written by 463 developers. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis of our studied models' performance on CAA using established machine learning interpretability techniques. The results of our analysis illustrate important findings that illuminate the behavior of LMs in understanding stylometric code patterns during the task of CAA, and point towards important directions for future work.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Rust ensures violations of such contract are impossible in regular safe code, but not in unsafe code where unsafe pinning APIs can be used. Library authors can encapsulate arbitrary unsafe code within regular library functions. These can be freely called in higher-level code without explicit warnings. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze library functions to rule out pinning API contract violations. Unfortunately, such testing relies on manual analysis by library authors, which is ineffective. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, given a library, attempts to construct programs that intentionally breach the pinning API contract by chaining library function calls, thereby verifying their soundness. We introduce RPIL, a novel intermediate representation that models functions' critical behaviors pertaining to pinning APIs. We implement PinChecker, a synthesis-driven violation detection tool guided by RPIL, which automatically synthesizes bug-revealing programs. Our experiments on 13 popular Rust libraries from crates.io found 2 confirmed bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Context Protocol (MCP) at First Glance: Studying the Security and Maintainability of MCP Servers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13538v4)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Foundation Models (FMs), such as GPT-4, are increasingly used in domains like finance and software engineering, reliance on textual interfaces limits these models' real-world interaction. To address this, FM providers introduced tool calling-triggering a proliferation of frameworks with distinct tool interfaces. In late 2024, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize this tool ecosystem, which has become the de facto standard with over eight million weekly SDK downloads. Despite its adoption, MCP's AI-driven, non-deterministic control flow introduces new risks to sustainability, security, and maintainability, warranting closer examination. Towards this end, we present the first large-scale empirical study of MCP servers. Using state-of-the-art health metrics and a hybrid analysis pipeline, combining a general-purpose static analysis tool with an MCP-specific scanner, we evaluate 1,899 open-source MCP servers to assess their health, security, and maintainability. Despite MCP servers demonstrating strong health metrics, we identify eight distinct vulnerabilities - only three overlapping with traditional software vulnerabilities. Additionally, 7.2% of servers contain general vulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning. Regarding maintainability, while 66% exhibit code smells, 14.4% contain nine bug patterns overlapping with traditional open-source software projects. These findings highlight the need for MCP-specific vulnerability detection techniques while reaffirming the value of traditional analysis and refactoring practices.</p></details> |  |

But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025.

| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |

However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases, remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests. This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its high-quality training data.

| **[AlphaTrans: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Approach for Repository-Level Code Translation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Use of LLMs for Documentation to Code Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16440v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to 71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing, such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight specific error patterns for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

Code Technical Debt (Code TD) prediction has gained significant attention in recent software engineering research. However, no standardized approach to Code TD prediction fully captures the factors influencing its evolution. Objective. Our study aims to assess the impact of time-dependent models and seasonal effects on Code TD prediction. It evaluates such models against widely used Machine Learning models, also considering the influence of seasonality on prediction performance. Methods. We trained 11 prediction models with 31 Java open-source projects. To assess their performance, we predicted future observations of the SQALE index. To evaluate the practical usability of our TD forecasting model and its impact on practitioners, we surveyed 23 software engineering professionals. Results. Our study confirms the benefits of time-dependent techniques, with the ARIMAX model outperforming the others. Seasonal effects improved predictive performance, though the impact remained modest. \ReviewerA{ARIMAX/SARIMAX models demonstrated to provide well-balanced long-term forecasts. The survey highlighted strong industry interest in short- to medium-term TD forecasts. Conclusions. Our findings support using techniques that capture time dependence in historical software metric data, particularly for Code TD. Effectively addressing this evidence requires adopting methods that account for temporal patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, these quality attributes are notably vulnerable to technical debt (TD). Few studies address TD in microservice systems, particularly on a large scale. This research explores how TD manifests in a large-scale microservice-based industrial system. The research is based on a mixed-method case study of a project including over 100 microservices and serving over 15k locations. Results are collected via a quantitative method based static code analyzers combined with qualitative insights derived from a focus group discussion with the development team and a follow-up interview with the lead architect of the case study system. Results show that (1) simple static source code analysis can be an efficient and effective entry point for holistic TD discovery, (2) inadequate communication significantly contributes to TD, (3) misalignment between architectural and organizational structures can exacerbate TD accumulation, (4) microservices can rapidly cycle through TD accumulation and resolution, a phenomenon referred to as "microservice architecture technical debt gamble". Finally, we identify a set of fitting strategies for TD management in microservice architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted to Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |

Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.</p></details> | 63 pages, 11 figures |

LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities.

Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> |  |

As artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) technologies become integral to software systems, testing has evolved to address their unique complexities. A critical advancement in this space is fairness testing, which identifies and mitigates biases in AI applications to promote ethical and equitable outcomes. Despite extensive academic research on fairness testing, including test input generation, test oracle identification, and component testing, practical adoption remains limited. Industry practitioners often lack clear guidelines and effective tools to integrate fairness testing into real-world AI development. This study investigates how software professionals test AI-powered systems for fairness through interviews with 22 practitioners working on AI and ML projects. Our findings highlight a significant gap between theoretical fairness concepts and industry practice. While fairness definitions continue to evolve, they remain difficult for practitioners to interpret and apply. The absence of industry-aligned fairness testing tools further complicates adoption, necessitating research into practical, accessible solutions. Key challenges include data quality and diversity, time constraints, defining effective metrics, and ensuring model interoperability. These insights emphasize the need to bridge academic advancements with actionable strategies and tools, enabling practitioners to systematically address fairness in AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavior Driven Development for 3D Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17057v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer 3D games are complex software environments that require novel testing processes to ensure high-quality standards. The Intelligent Verification/Validation for Extended Reality Based Systems (iv4XR) framework addresses this need by enabling the implementation of autonomous agents to automate game testing scenarios. This framework facilitates the automation of regression test cases for complex 3D games like Space Engineers. Nevertheless, the technical expertise required to define test scripts using iv4XR can constrain seamless collaboration between developers and testers. This paper reports how integrating a Behavior-driven Development (BDD) approach with the iv4XR framework allows the industrial company behind Space Engineers to automate regression testing. The success of this industrial collaboration has inspired the iv4XR team to integrate the BDD approach to improve the automation of play-testing for the experimental 3D game LabRecruits. Furthermore, the iv4XR framework has been extended with tactical programming to enable the automation of long-play test scenarios in Space Engineers. These results underscore the versatility of the iv4XR framework in supporting diverse testing approaches while showcasing how BDD empowers users to create, manage, and execute automated game tests using comprehensive and human-readable statements.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge in achieving adequate explanations is the elicitation of individual explanation needs, as it may be subject to severe hypothetical or confirmation biases. To address these challenges, we aim to establish user-based indicators concerning user behavior or system events that can be captured at runtime to determine when a need for explanations arises. In this work, we conducted explorative research in form of an online study to collect self-reported indicators that could indicate a need for explanation. We compiled a catalog containing 17 relevant indicators concerning user behavior, 8 indicators concerning system events and 14 indicators concerning emotional states or physical reactions. We also analyze the relationships between these indicators and different types of need for explanation. The established indicators can be used in the elicitation process through prototypes, as well as after publication to gather requirements from already deployed applications using telemetry and usage data. Moreover, these indicators can be used to trigger explanations at appropriate moments during the runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the research track of the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Quantum Eigensolver Algorithms With Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13587v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore accelerating Hamiltonian ground state energy calculation on NISQ devices. We suggest using search-based methods together with machine learning to accelerate quantum algorithms, exemplified in the Quantum Eigensolver use case. We trained two small models on classically mined data from systems with up to 16 qubits, using XGBoost's Python regressor. We evaluated our preliminary approach on 20-, 24- and 28-qubit systems by optimising the Eigensolver's hyperparameters. These models predict hyperparameter values, leading to a 0.12% reduction in error when tested on 28-qubit systems. However, due to inconclusive results with 20- and 24-qubit systems, we suggest further examination of the training data based on Hamiltonian characteristics. In future work, we plan to train machine learning models to optimise other aspects or subroutines of quantum algorithm execution beyond its hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
