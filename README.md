| **[Using Cooperative Co-evolutionary Search to Generate Metamorphic Test Cases for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03843v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) rely on Deep Neural Networks, allowing vehicles to navigate complex, open environments. However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 16 figures, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (2025)</p></details> |
| **[SceneGenAgent: Precise Industrial Scene Generation with Coding Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21909v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modeling of industrial scenes is essential for simulations in industrial manufacturing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/SceneGenAgent .</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Modeling Language Code Generation from Diagram Images Using Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12293v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Unified Modeling Language is a standardized visual language widely used for modeling and documenting the design of software systems. Although many tools generate UML diagrams from UML code, generating executable UML code from image-based UML diagrams remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach to generate UML code using a large multimodal language model automatically. Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models. The experiments measured code generation accuracy across different model sizes and training strategies. These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams. This will enable the modernization of legacy systems and decrease the manual effort in software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Journal of Machine Learning with Applications, Author Contributions: Averi Bates: Methodology, Development, Analysis, Data Curation, Drafting, Review.

| **[Are Large Language Models Robust in Understanding Code Against Semantics-Preserving Mutations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10443v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Repetition Problems of LLMs in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10402v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |
| **[Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful for Java Function Bug Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10375v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

| **[Mitigating Configuration Differences Between Development and Production Environments: A Catalog of Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09392v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The Configuration Management of the development and production environments is an important aspect of IT operations. However, managing the configuration differences between these two environments can be challenging, leading to inconsistent behavior, unexpected errors, and increased downtime. Objective: In this study, we sought to investigate the strategies software companies employ to mitigate the configuration differences between the development and production environments. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these strategies used to contribute to reducing the risk of configuration-related issues. Method: To achieve this goal, we interviewed 17 participants and leveraged the Thematic Analysis methodology to analyze the interview data. These participants shed some light on the current practices, processes, challenges, or issues they have encountered. Results: Based on the interviews, we systematically formulated and structured a catalog of eight strategies that explain how software producing companies mitigate these configuration differences. These strategies vary from 1) creating detailed configuration management plans, 2) using automation tools, and 3) developing processes to test and validate changes through containers and virtualization technologies. Conclusion: By implementing these strategies, companies can improve their ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the production environment. In addition, they can also ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

| **[Evaluating Mutation-based Fault Localization for Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09059v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to execute operations. They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Better Understanding of Probabilistic Delta Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04735v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.</p></details> | accepted by ICSE25 |

This has led to the emergence of AI for Software Engineering as a distinct research area within software engineering. With the development of quantum computing, the field of Quantum AI (QAI) is arising, enhancing the performance of classical AI and holding significant potential for solving classical software engineering problems. Some initial applications of QAI in software engineering have already emerged, such as software test optimization. However, the path ahead remains open, offering ample opportunities to solve complex software engineering problems with QAI cost-effectively. To this end, this paper presents open research opportunities and challenges in QAI for software engineering that need to be addressed.</p></details> |  |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing LLM Code Generation: A Systematic Evaluation of Multi-Agent Collaboration and Runtime Debugging for Improved Accuracy, Reliability, and Latency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02133v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models (LLMs) for automated code generation has emerged as a significant focus within AI research. As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE Arena: An Interactive Platform for Evaluating Foundation Models in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01860v4)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs), particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown significant promise in various software engineering (SE) tasks, including code generation, debugging, and requirement refinement. Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |
| **[Towards Source Mapping for Zero-Knowledge Smart Contracts: Design and Preliminary Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04322v4)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and auditing zero-knowledge-compatible smart contracts remains a significant challenge due to the lack of source mapping in compilers such as zkSolc. In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLPut: Investigating Large Language Models for Bug Report-Based Input Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20578v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failure-inducing inputs play a crucial role in diagnosing and analyzing software bugs. Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Code-Edit Embedding to Model Student Debugging Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19407v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing effective feedback for programming assignments in computer science education can be challenging: students solve problems by iteratively submitting code, executing it, and using limited feedback from the compiler or the auto-grader to debug. Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025)</p></details> |
| **[RocketPPA: Ultra-Fast LLM-Based PPA Estimator at Code-Level Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21971v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have recently transformed hardware design, yet bridging the gap between code synthesis and PPA (power, performance, and area) estimation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that leverages a 21k dataset of thoroughly cleaned and synthesizable Verilog modules, each annotated with detailed power, delay, and area metrics. By employing chain-of-thought techniques, we automatically debug and curate this dataset to ensure high fidelity in downstream applications. We then fine-tune CodeLlama using LoRA-based parameter-efficient methods, framing the task as a regression problem to accurately predict PPA metrics from Verilog code. Furthermore, we augment our approach with a mixture-of-experts architecture-integrating both LoRA and an additional MLP expert layer-to further refine predictions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: power estimation accuracy is enhanced by 5.9% at a 20% error threshold and by 7.2% at a 10% threshold, delay estimation improves by 5.1% and 3.9%, and area estimation sees gains of 4% and 7.9% for the 20% and 10% thresholds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of the mixture-of-experts module contributes an additional 3--4% improvement across these tasks. Our results establish a new benchmark for PPA-aware Verilog generation, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated dataset and modeling strategies for next-generation EDA workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can You Mimic Me? Exploring the Use of Android Record & Replay Tools in Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20237v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android User Interface (UI) testing is a critical research area due to the ubiquity of apps and the challenges faced by developers. Record and replay (R&R) tools facilitate manual and automated UI testing by recording UI actions to execute test scenarios and replay bugs. These tools typically support (i) regression testing, (ii) non-crashing functional bug reproduction, and (iii) crashing bug reproduction. However, prior work only examines these tools in fragmented settings, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across common use cases. We address this gap by conducting an empirical study on using R&R tools to record and replay non-crashing failures, crashing bugs, and feature-based user scenarios, and explore combining R&R with automated input generation (AIG) tools to replay crashing bugs. Our study involves one industrial and three academic R&R tools, 34 scenarios from 17 apps, 90 non-crashing failures from 42 apps, and 31 crashing bugs from 17 apps. Results show that 17% of scenarios, 38% of non-crashing bugs, and 44% of crashing bugs cannot be reliably recorded and replayed, mainly due to action interval resolution, API incompatibility, and Android tooling limitations. Our findings highlight key future research directions to enhance the practical application of R&R tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MobileSoft 2025</p></details> |

Put some Whamm on it!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20192v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and monitoring programs are integral to engineering and deploying software. Dynamic analyses monitor applications through source code or IR injection, machine code or bytecode rewriting, and virtual machine or direct hardware support. While these techniques are viable within their respective domains, common tooling across techniques is rare, leading to fragmentation of skills, duplicated efforts, and inconsistent feature support. We address this problem in the WebAssembly ecosystem with Whamm, a declarative instrumentation DSL for WebAssembly that abstracts above the instrumentation strategy, leveraging bytecode rewriting and engine support as available. Whamm solves three problems: 1) tooling fragmentation, 2) prohibitive instrumentation overhead of general-purpose frameworks, and 3) tedium of tailoring low-level high-performance mechanisms. Whamm provides fully-programmable instrumentation with declarative match rules, static and dynamic predication, automatic state reporting, and user library support, while achieving high performance through compiler and engine optimizations. At the back end, Whamm provides instrumentation to a Wasm engine as Wasm code, reusing existing engine optimizations and unlocking new ones, most notably intrinsification, to minimize overhead. In particular, explicitly requesting program state in match rules, rather than reflection, enables the engine to efficiently bundle arguments and even inline compiled probe logic. Whamm streamlines the tooling effort, as its bytecode-rewriting target can run instrumented programs everywhere, lowering fragmentation and advancing the state of the art for engine support. We evaluate Whamm with case studies of non-trivial monitors and show it is expressive, powerful, and efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoP2C: An LLM-Based Agent Framework for Code Repository Generation from Multimodal Content in Academic Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20115v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML) research is spread through academic papers featuring rich multimodal content, including text, diagrams, and tabular results. However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

Sojourner under Sabotage, a browser-based serious game, reimagines this learning experience by blending education with an immersive and interactive storyline. Players take on the role of a spaceship crew member, using unit testing and debugging techniques to identify and repair sabotaged components across seven progressively challenging levels. A study with 79 students demonstrates that the game is a powerful tool for enhancing motivation, engagement, and skill development. These findings underscore the transformative potential of serious games in making essential software engineering practices accessible and enjoyable.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriDebug: A Unified LLM for Verilog Debugging via Contrastive Embedding and Guided Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19099v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in debugging for various programming languages. However, the application of LLMs to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging. Unlike existing methods, VeriDebug employs an embedding-based technique to accurately retrieve internal information, followed by bug-fixing. VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves 64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo (36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of various large language models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA, GEMINI, and GPT-4o in interpreting such visual inputs. We employ prompt engineering techniques, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot learning, to assess each model's responsiveness and accuracy. Our findings show that while GPT-4o shows promising capabilities, achieving over 60% similarity to baseline questions for 51.75% of the tested images, challenges remain in obtaining consistent and accurate interpretations for more complex images. This research advances our understanding of the feasibility of using generative AI for image-centric problem-solving in developer communities, highlighting both the potential benefits and current limitations of this approach while envisioning a future where visual-based debugging copilot tools become a reality.</p></details> |  |

Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability, especially their error rates across domains and the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o). Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025. Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error distributions. Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50% with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%. Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over 50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates (~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability (10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability. Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from biological healing - where the human body detects damage, signals the brain, and activates targeted recovery - this paper explores the concept of self-healing software driven by artificial intelligence. We propose a novel framework that mimics this biological model system observability tools serve as sensory inputs, AI models function as the cognitive core for diagnosis and repair, and healing agents apply targeted code and test modifications. By combining log analysis, static code inspection, and AI-driven generation of patches or test updates, our approach aims to reduce downtime, accelerate debugging, and enhance software resilience. We evaluate the effectiveness of this model through case studies and simulations, comparing it against traditional manual debugging and recovery workflows. This work paves the way toward intelligent, adaptive and self-reliant software systems capable of continuous healing, akin to living organisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Interactive Debugger for Rust Trait Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18704v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiler diagnostics for type inference failures are notoriously bad, and type classes only make the problem worse. By introducing a complex search process during inference, type classes can lead to wholly inscrutable or useless errors. We describe a system, Argus, for interactively visualizing type class inferences to help programmers debug inference failures, applied specifically to Rust's trait system. The core insight of Argus is to avoid the traditional model of compiler diagnostics as one-size-fits-all, instead providing the programmer with different views on the search tree corresponding to different debugging goals. Argus carefully uses defaults to improve debugging productivity, including interface design (e.g., not showing full paths of types by default) and heuristics (e.g., sorting obligations based on the expected complexity of fixing them). We evaluated Argus in a user study where $N = 25$ participants debugged type inference failures in realistic Rust programs, finding that participants using Argus correctly localized $2.2\times$ as many faults and localized $3.3\times$ faster compared to not using Argus.</p></details> |  |

These missing links and data obstruct both developers and, more recently, large language models (LLMs) working with unfamiliar code. We present Codetations, a system that helps developers contextualize documents with rich notes and tools. Unlike previous approaches, notes in Codetations stay outside the document to prevent code clutter, attaching to spans in the document using a hybrid edit-tracking/LLM-based method. Their content is dynamic, interactive, and synchronized with code changes. A worked example shows that relevant notes with interactively-collected data improve LLM performance during code repair. In our user evaluation, developers praised these properties and saw significant potential in annotation types that we generated with an LLM in just a few minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design, where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix, we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct their software goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, FSE2025</p></details> |

Diffing Build Logs with CiDiff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18182v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous integration (CI) is widely used by developers to ensure the quality and reliability of their software projects. However, diagnosing a CI regression is a tedious process that involves the manual analysis of lengthy build logs. In this paper, we explore how textual differencing can support the debugging of CI regressions. As off-the-shelf diff algorithms produce suboptimal results, in this work we introduce a new diff algorithm specifically tailored to build logs called CiDiff. We evaluate CiDiff against several baselines on a novel dataset of 17 906 CI regressions, performing an accuracy study, a quantitative study and a user-study. Notably, our algorithm reduces the number of lines to inspect by about 60 % in the median case, with reasonable overhead compared to the state-of-practice LCS-diff. Finally, our algorithm is preferred by the majority of participants in 70 % of the regression cases, whereas LCS-diff is preferred in only 5 % of the cases.</p></details> |  |

(2) Showcases modern features, including per-app address spaces, threading, commodity filesystems, USB, DMA, multicore, self-hosted debugging, and a window manager. (3) Supports rich applications such as 2D/3D games, music and video players, and a blockchain miner. Unlike traditional instructional systems, VOS emphasizes strong motivation for building systems-supporting engaging, media-rich apps that go beyond basic terminal programs. To achieve this, we design VOS to strike a careful balance between essential OS complexity and overall simplicity. Our method, which we call inverse engineering, breaks down a full-featured OS into a set of incremental, self-contained prototypes. Each prototype introduces a minimal set of OS mechanisms, driven by the needs of specific apps. The construction process (i.e., forward engineering) then progressively enables these apps by bringing up one mechanism at a time. VOS makes it accessible for a wider audience to experience building a software system that is self-contained and usable in everyday scenarios.</p></details> |  |

General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2025 AI4EDU Workshop</p></details> |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, to appear at FSE 2025</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up industrial survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 17 images, 8 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, the lack of high-quality, scalable training datasets, especially those with verifiable outputs and intermediate reasoning traces-limits progress, particularly for open-source models. In this work, we present SWE-Synth, a framework for synthesizing realistic, verifiable, and process-aware bug-fix datasets at the repository level. SWE-Synth leverages LLM agents to simulate debugging workflows, producing not only bug-fix pairs but also test cases and structured repair trajectories. Compared to manually curated datasets, our method scales with minimal human effort while preserving contextual richness and correctness. Experiments show that models trained on SWE-Synth outperform those trained on real-world datasets by 2.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic, agent-generated data to advance the state of the art in APR and software engineering automation.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the complexity inherent to AI poses new challenges. Explainable AI (XAI) may allow developers to understand better the systems they build, which, in turn, can help with tasks like debugging. In this paper, we report insights from a series of surveys with software developers that highlight that there is indeed an increased need for explanatory tools to support developers in creating AI systems. However, the feedback also indicates that existing XAI systems still fall short of this aspiration. Thus, we see an unmet need to provide developers with adequate support mechanisms to cope with this complexity so they can embed AI into high-quality software in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Engineering Interactive Systems Embedding AI Technologies at EICS 2024, Tuesday June 25th, 2024 - Cagliary, Sardinia, Italy</p></details> |

It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools implement the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose ChaosEater, a system for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines the agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for Kubernetes systems, which are managed through code (i.e., Infrastructure as Code). Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater perform software engineering tasks to complete CE cycles, including requirement definition, code generation, debugging, and testing. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on both small and large Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it stably completes reasonable single CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. The CE cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>114 p...</summary><p>114 pages (7 main), 11 figures.

Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timing Analysis Agent: Autonomous Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) Timing Debugging with Timing Debug Relation Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11502v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timing analysis is an essential and demanding verification method for Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuit design and optimization. In addition, it also serves as the cornerstone of the final sign-off, determining whether the chip is ready to be sent to the semiconductor foundry for fabrication. Recently, as the technology advance relentlessly, smaller metal pitches and the increasing number of devices have led to greater challenges and longer turn-around-time for experienced human designers to debug timing issues from the Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) timing reports. As a result, an efficient and intelligent methodology is highly necessary and essential for debugging timing issues and reduce the turnaround times. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise across various tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, incorporating reasoning and actions. In this work, we propose a timing analysis agent, that is empowered by multi-LLMs task solving, and incorporates a novel hierarchical planning and solving flow to automate the analysis of timing reports from commercial tool. In addition, we build a Timing Debug Relation Graph (TDRG) that connects the reports with the relationships of debug traces from experienced timing engineers. The timing analysis agent employs the novel Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, that includes agent and coding to retrieve data accurately, on the developed TDRG. In our studies, the proposed timing analysis agent achieves an average 98% pass-rate on a single-report benchmark and a 90% pass-rate for multi-report benchmark from industrial designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[From "Worse is Better" to Better: Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent That Debugs: Dynamic State-Guided Vulnerability Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07634v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, more vulnerabilities have been discovered every day, while manual vulnerability repair requires specialized knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, many detected or even published vulnerabilities remain unpatched, thereby increasing the exposure of software systems to attacks. Recent advancements in agents based on Large Language Models have demonstrated their increasing capabilities in code understanding and generation, which can be promising to achieve automated vulnerability repair. However, the effectiveness of agents based on static information retrieval is still not sufficient for patch generation. To address the challenge, we propose a program repair agent called VulDebugger that fully utilizes both static and dynamic context, and it debugs programs in a manner akin to humans. The agent inspects the actual state of the program via the debugger and infers expected states via constraints that need to be satisfied. By continuously comparing the actual state with the expected state, it deeply understands the root causes of the vulnerabilities and ultimately accomplishes repairs. We experimentally evaluated VulDebugger on 50 real-life projects. With 60.00% successfully fixed, VulDebugger significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for vulnerability repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Accurately Do Large Language Models Understand Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04372v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric. Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 600,010 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs. We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 78% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently Under Review.

| **[CodeEditorBench: Evaluating Code Editing Capability of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03543v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) for code are rapidly evolving, with code editing emerging as a critical capability. We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Automated Refactoring for Efficient Migration of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support responsiveness w.r.t. ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations to make code amenable to safe, accurate, and efficient graph execution. We present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in specifying whether their otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL code could be reliably and efficiently executed as graphs while preserving semantics. The approach, based on a novel imperative tensor analysis, automatically determines when it is safe and potentially advantageous to migrate imperative DL code to graph execution. The approach is implemented as a PyDev Eclipse IDE plug-in that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and evaluated on 19 Python projects consisting of 132.05 KLOC. We found that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Studying the Impact of Early Test Termination Due to Assertion Failure on Code Coverage and Spectrum-based Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04557v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An assertion is commonly used to validate the expected programs behavior (e.g., if the returned value of a method equals an expected value) in software testing. Although it is a recommended practice to use only one assertion in a single test to avoid code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette), it is common to have multiple assertions in a single test. One issue with tests that have multiple assertions is that when the test fails at an early assertion (not the last one), the test will terminate at that point, and the remaining testing code will not be executed. This, in turn, can potentially reduce the code coverage and the performance of techniques that rely on code coverage information (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization). We refer to such a scenario as early test termination. Understanding the impact of early test termination on test coverage is important for software testing and debugging, particularly for the techniques that rely on coverage information obtained from the testing. We conducted the first empirical study on early test termination due to assertion failure (i.e., early test termination) by investigating 207 versions of 6 open-source projects. We found that a nonnegligible portion of the failed tests (19.1%) is early terminated due to assertion failure. Our findings indicate that early test termination harms both code coverage and the effectiveness of spectrum-based fault localization. For instance, after eliminating early test termination, the line/branch coverage is improved in 55% of the studied versions, and improves the performance of two popular SBFL techniques Ochiai and Tarantula by 15.1% and 10.7% compared to the original setting (without eliminating early test termination) in terms of MFR, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaCoder: An Adaptive Planning and Multi-Agent Framework for Function-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04220v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, researchers have proposed many multi-agent frameworks for function-level code generation, which aim to improve software development productivity by automatically generating function-level source code based on task descriptions. A typical multi-agent framework consists of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that are responsible for task planning, code generation, testing, debugging, etc. Studies have shown that existing multi-agent code generation frameworks perform well on ChatGPT. However, their generalizability across other foundation LLMs remains unexplored systematically. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the generalizability of four state-of-the-art multi-agent code generation frameworks across six open-source LLMs with varying parameter sizes, architectures, and performance levels. Our study reveals the unstable generalizability of existing frameworks on diverse foundation LLMs. Based on the findings obtained from the empirical study, we propose AdaCoder, a novel adaptive planning, multi-agent framework for function-level code generation. AdaCoder has two phases. Phase-1 is an initial code generation step without planning, which uses an LLM-based coding agent and a script-based testing agent to unleash LLM's native power, identify cases beyond LLM's power, and determine the errors hindering execution. Phase-2 adds a rule-based debugging agent and an LLM-based planning agent for iterative code generation with planning. Our evaluation shows that AdaCoder achieves higher generalizability on diverse LLMs. Compared to the best baseline MapCoder, AdaCoder is on average 27.69% higher in Pass@1, 16 times faster in inference, and 12 times lower in token consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenCodeInstruct: A Large-scale Instruction Tuning Dataset for Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04030v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development by enabling code generation, automated debugging, and complex reasoning. However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Productively Deploying Emerging Models on Emerging Platforms: A Top-Down Approach for Testing and Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09151v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While existing machine learning (ML) frameworks focus on established platforms, like running CUDA on server-grade GPUs, there have been growing demands to enable emerging AI applications in a broader set of scenarios, such as running Large Language Models (LLMs) within browsers and mobile phones. However, deploying emerging models on new platforms (such as Metal and WebGPU) presents significant software engineering challenges due to rapid model evolution and limited tooling and practices for these platforms. Previous practice for ML model deployment often follows a bottom-up fashion, where engineers first implement individual required operators and then put them together. However, this traditional development approach fails to meet the productivity requirements when deploying emerging ML applications, with the testing and debugging part as a bottleneck. To this end, we introduce \textsc{TapML}, a top-down approach designed to streamline model deployment on diverse platforms. While the traditional bottom-up approach requires crafting manual tests, \textsc{TapML} automatically creates high-quality, realistic test data through operator-wise test carving. Furthermore, \textsc{TapML} uses a migration-based strategy to gradually offload model implementation from the mature source platform to the target platform, minimizing the debugging scope of compound errors. \textsc{TapML} has been used as the default development method in the MLC-LLM project to deploy emerging ML models. Within 2 years, \textsc{TapML} has accelerated the deployment of 105 emerging models in 27 model architectures across 5 emerging platforms. We show that \textsc{TapML} effectively boosts developer productivity while ensuring the quality of deployed models. Furthermore, we summarize comprehensive case studies from our real-world development, offering best practices for developing emerging ML systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartFL: Semantics Based Probabilistic Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23224v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing-based fault localization has been a research focus in software engineering in the past decades. It localizes faulty program elements based on a set of passing and failing test executions. Since whether a fault could be triggered and detected by a test is related to program semantics, it is crucial to model program semantics in fault localization approaches. Existing approaches either consider the full semantics of the program (e.g., mutation-based fault localization and angelic debugging), leading to scalability issues, or ignore the semantics of the program (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization), leading to imprecise localization results. Our key idea is: by modeling only the correctness of program values but not their full semantics, a balance could be reached between effectiveness and scalability. To realize this idea, we introduce a probabilistic model by efficient approximation of program semantics and several techniques to address scalability challenges. Our approach, SmartFL(SeMantics bAsed pRobabilisTic Fault Localization), is evaluated on a real-world dataset, Defects4J 2.0. The top-1 statement-level accuracy of our approach is {14\%}, which improves 130\% over the best SBFL and MBFL methods. The average time cost is {205} seconds per fault, which is half of SBFL methods. After combining our approach with existing approaches using the CombineFL framework, the performance of the combined approach is significantly boosted by an average of 10\% on top-1, top-3, and top-5 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art combination methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering Code: https://github.com/toledosakasa/SMARTFL This update corrects the author's name</p></details> |

This paper explores the capabilities and applications of Llama-driven code generation, highlighting its ability to translate natural language prompts into executable code across multiple programming languages. Key features include contextual awareness, multi-language support, and enhanced debugging and optimization functionalities. By examining these aspects, we illustrate how Llama can serve as a versatile tool for developers of all skill levels, improving productivity and efficiency in software development. The potential implications for education, industry, and the future of coding practices are also discussed, underscoring the transformative impact of AI in programming. Experimentation shows that while Llama 3.1 405B performs well with simple algorithmic and data structure based problems, it still struggles with problems on Quantum Computing, Bioinformatics, and Artificial Intelligence.</p></details> | updated version |
| **[Are Autonomous Web Agents Good Testers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01495v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in automated testing, manual testing remains prevalent due to the high maintenance demands associated with test script fragility-scripts often break with minor changes in application structure. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential alternative by powering Autonomous Web Agents (AWAs) that can autonomously interact with applications. These agents may serve as Autonomous Test Agents (ATAs), potentially reducing the need for maintenance-heavy automated scripts by utilising natural language instructions similar to those used by human testers. This paper investigates the feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and how to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web applications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and failing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and pinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps, verifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using our benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed to a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best performing implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation, SeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA implementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement). However, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a promising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be addressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for robust, low maintenance test automation.

We posit that LLMs can benefit from the ability to interactively explore a codebase to gather the information relevant to their task. To achieve this, we present a textual environment, namely debug-gym, for developing LLM-based agents in an interactive coding setting. Our environment is lightweight and provides a preset of useful tools, such as a Python debugger (pdb), designed to facilitate an LLM-based agent's interactive debugging. Beyond coding and debugging tasks, this approach can be generalized to other tasks that would benefit from information-seeking behavior by an LLM agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Code Translation in Repository Context via Triple Knowledge-Augmented](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18305v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have behaved well in function-level code translation without repository-level context. However, the performance of LLMs in repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex dependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans, which leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation quality under repository context in real-world software development. First, K-Trans constructs a translation knowledge base by extracting relevant information from target-language codebases, the repository being translated, and prior translation results. Second, for each function to be translated, K-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code samples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs, serving as references to enhance LLM for translation. Third, K-Trans constructs a knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge and employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository context. It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation correctness. The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline adapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and 0.138 in CodeBLEU. It is important to note that the results also demonstrate that each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in handling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage examples making the most notable contribution. Moreover, as the self-evolution process progresses, the knowledge base continuously enhances the LLM's performance across various aspects of the repository-level code translation.</p></details> |  |

Given the English description of a programming problem and a set of unit tests, the model's goal is to synthesize the correct program that solves the problem and passes the tests. QualityFlow includes large language model (LLM) agents resembling a software development team, including code generation, testing, and self-debugging. We propose the LLM Quality Checker, which explicitly "imagines" whether the synthesized programs' execution would conform to the unit tests. The Quality Checks dynamically control the workflow, including actions to submit the final answer, clarify the problem statement, and revert previous workflow steps. Our experiments show that the Quality Checker can precisely accept any correct program, mitigate faulty synthesized tests, and prevent potential workflow deviation. QualityFlow establishes the state-of-the-art results on four program synthesis benchmarks: MBPP, HumanEval, and stricter evaluations from MBPP-EvalPlus and HumanEval-EvalPlus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Debugging and Runtime Analysis of Neural Networks with VLMs (A Case Study)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17416v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly vision models, is very challenging due to the complex and opaque decision-making processes in these networks. In this paper, we explore multi-modal Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to automatically interpret the opaque representation space of vision models using natural language. This in turn, enables a semantic analysis of model behavior using human-understandable concepts, without requiring costly human annotations. Key to our approach is the notion of semantic heatmap, that succinctly captures the statistical properties of DNNs in terms of the concepts discovered with the VLM and that are computed off-line using a held-out data set. We show the utility of semantic heatmaps for fault localization -- an essential step in debugging -- in vision models. Our proposed technique helps localize the fault in the network (encoder vs head) and also highlights the responsible high-level concepts, by leveraging novel differential heatmaps, which summarize the semantic differences between the correct and incorrect behaviour of the analyzed DNN. We further propose a lightweight runtime analysis to detect and filter-out defects at runtime, thus improving the reliability of the analyzed DNNs. The runtime analysis works by measuring and comparing the similarity between the heatmap computed for a new (unseen) input and the heatmaps computed a-priori for correct vs incorrect DNN behavior. We consider two types of defects: misclassifications and vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate the debugging and runtime analysis on a case study involving a complex ResNet-based classifier trained on the RIVAL10 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>CAIN ...</summary><p>CAIN 2025 (4th International Conference on AI Engineering -- Software Engineering for AI)</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Pitfalls: Understanding Why AI-driven Code Agents Fail at GitHub Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARS: Dynamic Action Re-Sampling to Enhance Coding Agent Performance by Adaptive Tree Traversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14269v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, including natural language processing, data analysis, and software development, by enabling automation. In software engineering, LLM-powered coding agents have garnered significant attention due to their potential to automate complex development tasks, assist in debugging, and enhance productivity. However, existing approaches often struggle with sub-optimal decision-making, requiring either extensive manual intervention or inefficient compute scaling strategies. To improve coding agent performance, we present Dynamic Action Re-Sampling (DARS), a novel inference time compute scaling approach for coding agents, that is faster and more effective at recovering from sub-optimal decisions compared to baselines. While traditional agents either follow linear trajectories or rely on random sampling for scaling compute, our approach DARS works by branching out a trajectory at certain key decision points by taking an alternative action given the history of the trajectory and execution feedback of the previous attempt from that point. We evaluate our approach on SWE-Bench Lite benchmark, demonstrating that this scaling strategy achieves a pass@k score of 55% with Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2. Our framework achieves a pass@1 rate of 47%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[KernelGPT: Enhanced Kernel Fuzzing via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00563v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs in operating system kernels can affect billions of devices and users all over the world. As a result, a large body of research has been focused on kernel fuzzing, i.e., automatically generating syscall (system call) sequences to detect potential kernel bugs or vulnerabilities. Kernel fuzzing aims to generate valid syscall sequences guided by syscall specifications that define both the syntax and semantics of syscalls. While there has been existing work trying to automate syscall specification generation, this remains largely manual work, and a large number of important syscalls are still uncovered. In this paper, we propose KernelGPT, the first approach to automatically synthesizing syscall specifications via Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced kernel fuzzing. Our key insight is that LLMs have seen massive kernel code, documentation, and use cases during pre-training, and thus can automatically distill the necessary information for making valid syscalls. More specifically, KernelGPT leverages an iterative approach to automatically infer the specifications, and further debug and repair them based on the validation feedback. Our results demonstrate that KernelGPT can generate more new and valid specifications and achieve higher coverage than state-of-the-art techniques. So far, by using newly generated specifications, KernelGPT has already detected 24 new unique bugs in Linux kernel, with 12 fixed and 11 assigned with CVE numbers. Moreover, a number of specifications generated by KernelGPT have already been merged into the kernel fuzzer Syzkaller, following the request from its development team.</p></details> | ASPLOS 2025 |
| **[Mutation Testing via Iterative Large Language Model-Driven Scientific Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08182v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible test code. Intuitively they generate this by imitating tests seen in their training data, rather than reasoning about execution semantics. However, such reasoning is important when applying mutation testing, where individual tests need to demonstrate differences in program behavior between a program and specific artificial defects (mutants). In this paper, we evaluate whether Scientific Debugging, which has been shown to help LLMs when debugging, can also help them to generate tests for mutants. In the resulting approach, LLMs form hypotheses about how to kill specific mutants, and then iteratively generate and refine tests until they succeed, all with detailed explanations for each step. We compare this method to three baselines: (1) directly asking the LLM to generate tests, (2) repeatedly querying the LLM when tests fail, and (3) search-based test generation with Pynguin. Our experiments evaluate these methods based on several factors, including mutation score, code coverage, success rate, and the ability to identify equivalent mutants. The results demonstrate that LLMs, although requiring higher computation cost, consistently outperform Pynguin in generating tests with better fault detection and coverage. Importantly, we observe that the iterative refinement of test cases is important for achieving high-quality test suites.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Bug Reproduction for Effective Automated Program Repair at Google](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01821v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reports often lack sufficient detail for developers to reproduce and fix the underlying defects. Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs), tests that fail when the bug is present and pass when it has been resolved, are crucial for debugging, but they are rarely included in bug reports, both in open-source and in industrial settings. Thus, automatically generating BRTs from bug reports has the potential to accelerate the debugging process and lower time to repair. This paper investigates automated BRT generation within an industry setting, specifically at Google, focusing on the challenges of a large-scale, proprietary codebase and considering real-world industry bugs extracted from Google's internal issue tracker. We adapt and evaluate a state-of-the-art BRT generation technique, LIBRO, and present our agent-based approach, BRT Agent, which makes use of a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for code editing. Our BRT Agent significantly outperforms LIBRO, achieving a 28% plausible BRT generation rate, compared to 10% by LIBRO, on 80 human-reported bugs from Google's internal issue tracker. We further investigate the practical value of generated BRTs by integrating them with an Automated Program Repair (APR) system at Google. Our results show that providing BRTs to the APR system results in 30% more bugs with plausible fixes. Additionally, we introduce Ensemble Pass Rate (EPR), a metric which leverages the generated BRTs to select the most promising fixes from all fixes generated by APR system. Our evaluation on EPR for Top-K and threshold-based fix selections demonstrates promising results and trade-offs. For example, EPR correctly selects a plausible fix from a pool of 20 candidates in 70% of cases, based on its top-1 ranking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Autonomous Programming using Iterative Multi-Agent Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07693v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) suffers from a "near-miss syndrome": the generated code closely resembles a correct solution but fails unit tests due to minor errors. We address this with a multi-agent framework called Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, and Repair (SEIDR). Effectively applying SEIDR to instruction-tuned LLMs requires determining (a) optimal prompts for LLMs, (b) what ranking algorithm selects the best programs in debugging rounds, and (c) balancing the repair of unsuccessful programs with the generation of new ones. We empirically explore these trade-offs by comparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies. We also evaluate lexicase and tournament selection to rank candidates in each generation. On Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 (PSB2), our framework outperforms both conventional use of OpenAI Codex without a repair phase and traditional genetic programming approaches. SEIDR outperforms the use of an LLM alone, solving 18 problems in C++ and 20 in Python on PSB2 at least once across experiments. To assess generalizability, we employ GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 on the PSB2 and HumanEval-X benchmarks. Although SEIDR with these models does not surpass current state-of-the-art methods on the Python benchmarks, the results on HumanEval-C++ are promising. SEIDR with Llama 3-8B achieves an average pass@100 of 84.2%. Across all SEIDR runs, 163 of 164 problems are solved at least once with GPT-3.5 in HumanEval-C++, and 162 of 164 with the smaller Llama 3-8B. We conclude that SEIDR effectively overcomes the near-miss syndrome in program synthesis with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM Trans. Evol.

However, most research focuses on generating correct patches while ignoring the consistency between the fixed code and the original buggy code. How to conduct adaptive bug fixing and generate patches with minimal modifications have seldom been investigated. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a novel task, namely AdaPR (Adaptive Program Repair). We then propose a two-stage approach AdaPatcher (Adaptive Patch Generator) to enhance program repair while maintaining the consistency. In the first stage, we utilize a Bug Locator with self-debug learning to accurately pinpoint bug locations. In the second stage, we train a Program Modifier to ensure consistency between the post-modified fixed code and the pre-modified buggy code. The Program Modifier is enhanced with a location-aware repair learning strategy to generate patches based on identified buggy lines, a hybrid training strategy for selective reference and an adaptive preference learning to prioritize fewer changes. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our two-stage framework for the newly proposed AdaPR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI2025 Oral</p></details> |
| **[PromptPex: Automatic Test Generation for Language Model Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05070v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being used in many applications and prompts for these models are integrated into software applications as code-like artifacts. These prompts behave much like traditional software in that they take inputs, generate outputs, and perform some specific function. However, prompts differ from traditional code in many ways and require new approaches to ensure that they are robust. For example, unlike traditional software the output of a prompt depends on the AI model that interprets it. Also, while natural language prompts are easy to modify, the impact of updates is harder to predict. New approaches to testing, debugging, and modifying prompts with respect to the model running them are required. To address some of these issues, we developed PromptPex, an LLM-based tool to automatically generate and evaluate unit tests for a given prompt. PromptPex extracts input and output specifications from a prompt and uses them to generate diverse, targeted, and valid unit tests. These tests are instrumental in identifying regressions when a prompt is changed and also serve as a tool to understand how prompts are interpreted by different models. We use PromptPex to generate tests for eight benchmark prompts and evaluate the quality of the generated tests by seeing if they can cause each of four diverse models to produce invalid output. PromptPex consistently creates tests that result in more invalid model outputs than a carefully constructed baseline LLM-based test generator. Furthermore, by extracting concrete specifications from the input prompt, PromptPex allows prompt writers to clearly understand and test specific aspects of their prompts. The source code of PromptPex is available at https://github.com/microsoft/promptpex.</p></details> |  |

Despite their growing adoption, there is a notable lack of formal, qualitative assessments of how LLMs are applied in real-world software development contexts. To fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with sixteen early-adopter professional developers to explore their use of LLMs throughout various stages of the software development life cycle. Our investigation examines four dimensions: people - how LLMs affect individual developers and teams; process - how LLMs alter software engineering workflows; product - LLM impact on software quality and innovation; and society - the broader socioeconomic and ethical implications of LLM adoption. Thematic analysis of our data reveals that while LLMs have not fundamentally revolutionized the development process, they have substantially enhanced routine coding tasks, including code generation, refactoring, and debugging. Developers reported the most effective outcomes when providing LLMs with clear, well-defined problem statements, indicating that LLMs excel with decomposed problems and specific requirements. Furthermore, these early-adopters identified that LLMs offer significant value for personal and professional development, aiding in learning new languages and concepts. Early-adopters, highly skilled in software engineering and how LLMs work, identified early and persisting challenges for software engineering, such as inaccuracies in generated content and the need for careful manual review before integrating LLM outputs into production environments. Our study provides a nuanced understanding of how LLMs are shaping the landscape of software development, with their benefits, limitations, and ongoing implications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Memorization: Evaluating the True Type Inference Capabilities of LLMs for Java Code Snippets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04076v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often found on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type information such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries. Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code snippets, showing promising results. However, these results are potentially affected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public on GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023). Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs' strong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere retrieval of ground truth from training data. To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code snippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. First, utilizing Thalia, a program synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for type inference evaluation. On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped significantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall. Second, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly degraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in understanding code semantics. Third, we used delta debugging to identify the minimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference. While type inference primarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly infer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a reliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the snippets. Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from data leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code snippets. Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed benchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs for type inference tasks.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models (FMs) play an increasingly prominent role in complex software systems, such as agentic software, they introduce significant observability and debuggability challenges. Although recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate their thought processes as part of the output, in many scenarios fast-thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) are still preferred due to latency constraints. LLM-powered agents operate autonomously with opaque implicit reasoning, making it difficult to debug their unexpected behaviors or errors. In this paper, we introduce Watson, a novel framework that provides reasoning observability into the implicit reasoning processes of agents driven by fast-thinking LLMs, allowing the identification and localization of errors and guidance for corrections. We demonstrate the accuracy of the recovered implicit reasoning trace by Watson and its usefulness through debugging and improving the performance of LLM-powered agents in two scenarios: Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark and SWE-bench-lite. Using Watson, we were able to observe and identify the implicit reasoning errors, and automatically provide targeted corrections at runtime that improve the Pass@1 of agents on MMLU and SWE-bench-lite by 7.58 (13.45% relative improvement) and 7.76 (12.31% relative improvement) percentage points, respectively, without updates to models or the cognitive architecture of the agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using CognitIDE to Capture Developers' Cognitive Load via Physiological Activity During Everyday Software Development Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03537v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated development environments (IDE) support developers in a variety of tasks. Unobtrusively capturing developers' cognitive load while working on different programming tasks could help optimize developers' work experience, increase their productivity, and positively impact code quality. In this paper, we propose a study in which the IntelliJ-based IDE plugin CognitIDE is used to collect, map, and visualize software developers' physiological activity data while they are working on various software development tasks. In a feasibility study, participants completed four simulated everyday working tasks of software developers - coding, debugging, code documentation, and email writing - based on Java open source code in the IDE whilst their physiological activity was recorded. Between the tasks, the participants' perceived workload was assessed. Feasibility testing showed that CognitIDE could successfully be used for data collection sessions of one hour, which was the most extended duration tested and was well-perceived by those working with it. Furthermore, the recorded physiological activity indicated higher cognitive load during working tasks compared to baseline recordings. This suggests that cognitive load can be assessed, mapped to code positions, visualized, and discussed with participants in such study setups with CognitIDE. These promising results indicate the usefulness of the plugin for diverse study workflows in a natural IDE environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeIF: Benchmarking the Instruction-Following Capabilities of Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19166v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for robust instruction-following capabilities in code generation tasks has grown significantly. Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Survey on Debugging Techniques for Machine Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03158v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging ML software (i.e., the detection, localization and fixing of faults) poses unique challenges compared to traditional software largely due to the probabilistic nature and heterogeneity of its development process. Various methods have been proposed for testing, diagnosing, and repairing ML systems. However, the big picture informing important research directions that really address the dire needs of developers is yet to unfold, leaving several key questions unaddressed: (1) What faults have been targeted in the ML debugging research that fulfill developers needs in practice? (2) How are these faults addressed? (3) What are the challenges in addressing the yet untargeted faults? In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of debugging techniques for machine learning systems. We first collect technical papers focusing on debugging components in machine learning software. We then map these papers to a taxonomy of faults to assess the current state of fault resolution identified in existing literature. Subsequently, we analyze which techniques are used to address specific faults based on the collected papers. This results in a comprehensive taxonomy that aligns faults with their corresponding debugging methods. Finally, we examine previously released transcripts of interviewing developers to identify the challenges in resolving unfixed faults. Our analysis reveals that only 48 percent of the identified ML debugging challenges have been explicitly addressed by researchers, while 46.9 percent remain unresolved or unmentioned. In real world applications, we found that 52.6 percent of issues reported on GitHub and 70.3% of problems discussed in interviews are still unaddressed by research in ML debugging. The study identifies 13 primary challenges in ML debugging, highlighting a significant gap between the identification of ML debugging issues and their resolution in practice.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Towards Understanding the Impact of Data Bugs on Deep Learning Models in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12137v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved significant success in various software engineering tasks (e.g., code completion by Copilot). However, DL systems are prone to bugs from many sources, including training data. Existing literature suggests that bugs in training data are highly prevalent, but little research has focused on understanding their impacts on the models used in software engineering tasks. In this paper, we address this research gap through a comprehensive empirical investigation focused on three types of data prevalent in software engineering tasks: code-based, text-based, and metric-based. Using state-of-the-art baselines, we compare the models trained on clean datasets with those trained on datasets with quality issues and without proper preprocessing. By analysing the gradients, weights, and biases from neural networks under training, we identify the symptoms of data quality and preprocessing issues. Our analysis reveals that quality issues in code data cause biased learning and gradient instability, whereas problems in text data lead to overfitting and poor generalisation of models. On the other hand, quality issues in metric data result in exploding gradients and model overfitting, and inadequate preprocessing exacerbates these effects across all three data types. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and generalizability of our findings using six new datasets. Our research provides a better understanding of the impact and symptoms of data bugs in software engineering datasets. Practitioners and researchers can leverage these findings to develop better monitoring systems and data-cleaning methods to help detect and resolve data bugs in deep learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Major Revision at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |

In particular, they have demonstrated remarkable utility in the task of code repair. However, common benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of code LLMs are often limited to small-scale settings. In this work, we build upon kGym, which shares a benchmark for system-level Linux kernel bugs and a platform to run experiments on the Linux kernel. This paper introduces CrashFixer, the first LLM-based software repair agent that is applicable to Linux kernel bugs. Inspired by the typical workflow of a kernel developer, we identify the key capabilities an expert developer leverages to resolve a kernel crash. Using this as our guide, we revisit the kGym platform and identify key system improvements needed to practically run LLM-based agents at the scale of the Linux kernel (50K files and 20M lines of code). We implement these changes by extending kGym to create an improved platform - called kGymSuite, which will be open-sourced. Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of various repair strategies for such complex kernel bugs and showcases the value of explicitly generating a hypothesis before attempting to fix bugs in complex systems such as the Linux kernel. We also evaluated CrashFixer's capabilities on still open bugs, and found at least two patch suggestions considered plausible to resolve the reported bug.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grouptuner: Efficient Group-Aware Compiler Auto-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08598v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern compilers typically provide hundreds of options to optimize program performance, but users often cannot fully leverage them due to the huge number of options. While standard optimization combinations (e.g., -O3) provide reasonable defaults, they often fail to deliver near-peak performance across diverse programs and architectures. To address this challenge, compiler auto-tuning techniques have emerged to automate the discovery of improved option combinations. Existing techniques typically focus on identifying critical options and prioritizing them during the search to improve efficiency. However, due to limited tuning iterations, the resulting data is often sparse and noisy, making it highly challenging to accurately identify critical options. As a result, these algorithms are prone to being trapped in local optima. To address this limitation, we propose GroupTuner, a group-aware auto-tuning technique that directly applies localized mutation to coherent option groups based on historically best-performing combinations, thus avoiding explicitly identifying critical options. By forgoing the need to know precisely which options are most important, GroupTuner maximizes the use of existing performance data, ensuring more targeted exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTuner can efficiently discover competitive option combinations, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.39% over -O3 while requiring only 77.21% of the time compared to the random search algorithm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in the ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES'25), June 16-17, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea</p></details> |
| **[Detecting the Root Cause Code Lines in Bug-Fixing Commits by Heterogeneous Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01022v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous growth in the scale and complexity of software systems, defect remediation has become increasingly difficult and costly. Automated defect prediction tools can proactively identify software changes prone to defects within software projects, thereby enhancing software development efficiency. However, existing work in heterogeneous and complex software projects continues to face challenges, such as struggling with heterogeneous commit structures and ignoring cross-line dependencies in code changes, which ultimately reduce the accuracy of defect identification. To address these challenges, we propose an approach called RC_Detector. RC_Detector comprises three main components: the bug-fixing graph construction component, the code semantic aggregation component, and the cross-line semantic retention component. The bug-fixing graph construction component identifies the code syntax structures and program dependencies within bug-fixing commits and transforms them into heterogeneous graph formats by converting the source code into vector representations. The code semantic aggregation component adapts to heterogeneous data by using heterogeneous attention to learn the hidden semantic representation of target code lines. The cross-line semantic retention component regulates propagated semantic information by using attenuation and reinforcement gates derived from old and new code semantic representations, effectively preserving cross-line semantic relationships. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our model by collecting data from 87 open-source projects, including 675 bug-fixing commits. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements of 83.15%,96.83%,78.71%,74.15%,54.14%,91.66%,91.66%, and 34.82% in MFR, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Constructing test scenarios for autonomous driving systems (ADSs), however, is labor-intensive. We propose TARGET, an end-to-end framework that automatically generates test scenarios from traffic rules. To address complexity, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract knowledge from traffic rules. To mitigate hallucinations caused by large context during input processing, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to be syntactically simple and compositional. This design allows the LLM to learn and generate test scenarios in a modular manner while enabling syntactic and semantic validation for each component. Based on these validated representations, TARGET synthesizes executable scripts to render scenarios in simulation. Evaluated seven ADSs with 284 scenarios derived from 54 traffic rules, TARGET uncovered 610 rule violations, collisions, and other issues. For each violation, TARGET generates scenario recordings and detailed logs, aiding root cause analysis. Two identified issues were confirmed by ADS developers: one linked to an existing bug report and the other to limited ADS functionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Detection of Tangled Code Changes for Higher-Quality Method-Level Bug Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08263v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tangled code changes-commits that conflate unrelated modifications such as bug fixes, refactorings, and enhancements-introduce significant noise into bug datasets and adversely affect the performance of bug prediction models. Addressing this issue at a fine-grained, method-level granularity remains underexplored. This is critical to address, as recent bug prediction models, driven by practitioner demand, are increasingly focusing on finer granularity rather than traditional class- or file-level predictions. This study investigates the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting tangled code changes by leveraging both commit messages and method-level code diffs. We formulate the problem as a binary classification task and evaluate multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, using state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash. Our results demonstrate that combining commit messages with code diffs significantly enhances model performance, with the combined few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting achieving an F1-score of 0.88. Additionally, we explore embedding-based machine learning models trained on LLM-generated embeddings, where a multi-layer perceptron classifier achieves superior performance (F1-score: 0.906, MCC: 0.807). These findings are encouraging for the research community, as method-level bug prediction remains an open research problem, largely due to the lack of noise-free bug datasets. This research not only contributes a novel method-level perspective to the untangling problem but also highlights practical avenues for enhancing automated software quality assessment tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Bug-Proneness of Refactored Code: A Longitudinal Multi-Project Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08005v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refactoring is a common practice in software development, aimed at improving the internal code structure in order to make it easier to understand and modify. Consequently, it is often assumed that refactoring makes the code less prone to bugs. However, in practice, refactoring is a complex task and applied in different ways (e.g., various refactoring types, single vs. composite refactorings) and with a variety of purposes (e.g., root-canal vs. floss refactoring). Therefore, certain refactorings can inadvertently make the code more prone to bugs. Unfortunately, there is limited research in the literature on the long-term relationship between the different characteristics of refactorings and bugs. This paper presents a longitudinal study of 12 open source software projects, where 27,450 refactorings, 6,051 reported bugs, and 49,250 bugs detected with static analysis tools were analyzed. While our study confirms the common intuition that refactored code is less bug-prone than non-refactored code, we also extend or contradict existing body of knowledge in other ways. First, a code element that undergoes multiple refactorings is not less bug-prone than an element that undergoes a single refactoring. A single refactoring is the one not performed in conjunction with other refactorings in the same commit. Second, single refactorings often induce the occurrence of bugs across all analyzed projects. Third, code elements affected by refactorings made in conjunction with other non-refactoring changes in the same commit (i.e., floss refactorings) are often bug-prone. Finally, many of such bugs induced by refactoring cannot be revealed with state-of-the-art techniques for detecting behavior-preserving refactorings.</p></details> |  |

While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

This is especially true for foundation libraries, which are used by the software packages visible to the users, being ``hidden'' themselves. The funders and other organizations need to understand the complex network of computer programs that the modern research relies upon. In this work we used CZ Software Mentions Dataset to map the dependencies of the software used in biomedical papers and find the packages critical to the software ecosystems. We propose the centrality metrics for the network of software dependencies, analyze three ecosystems (PyPi, CRAN, Bioconductor) and determine the packages with the highest centrality.</p></details> |  |

This approach is particularly valuable for scientific computing applications in which comprehensive tests are needed to prevent flawed results or conclusions. As scientific discovery becomes increasingly more complex, domain scientists couple multiple scientific computing models or simulations to solve intricate multiphysics and multiscale problems. These model-coupling applications use a hardwired coupling program or a flexible web service to link and combine different models. In this paper, we focus on the quality assurance of the more elastic web service via a combination of rigorous specification and testing methods. The application of statistical testing exposes problems ignored by pre-written unit tests and highlights areas in the code where failures might occur. We certify the model-coupling server controller with a derived reliability statistic, offering a quantitative measure to support a claim of its robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to SEKE2025</p></details> |

However, their misuse introduces vulnerabilities, potentially leading to severe data breaches and substantial financial loss. Complex API design, inadequate documentation, and insufficient security training often lead to unintentional misuse by developers. The software security community has devised and evaluated several approaches to detecting security API misuse to help developers and organizations. This study rigorously reviews the literature on detecting misuse of security APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of this critical domain. Our goal is to identify and analyze security API misuses, the detection approaches developed, and the evaluation methodologies employed along with the open research avenues to advance the state-of-the-art in this area. Employing the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, we analyzed 69 research papers. Our review has yielded (a) identification of 6 security API types; (b) classification of 30 distinct misuses; (c) categorization of detection techniques into heuristic-based and ML-based approaches; and (d) identification of 10 performance measures and 9 evaluation benchmarks. The review reveals a lack of coverage of detection approaches in several areas. We recommend that future efforts focus on aligning security API development with developers' needs and advancing standardized evaluation methods for detection technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM Computing Surveys, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Mutation-based Fault Localization for Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09059v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to execute operations. They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[AI-Mediated Code Comment Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09021v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes an approach to improve code comments along different quality axes by rewriting those comments with customized Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools. We conduct an empirical study followed by grounded theory qualitative analysis to determine the quality axes to improve. Then we propose a procedure using a Large Language Model (LLM) to rewrite existing code comments along the quality axes. We implement our procedure using GPT-4o, then distil the results into a smaller model capable of being run in-house, so users can maintain data custody. We evaluate both our approach using GPT-4o and the distilled model versions. We show in an evaluation how our procedure improves code comments along the quality axes. We release all data and source code in an online repository for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

In particular, they have demonstrated remarkable utility in the task of code repair. However, common benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of code LLMs are often limited to small-scale settings. In this work, we build upon kGym, which shares a benchmark for system-level Linux kernel bugs and a platform to run experiments on the Linux kernel. This paper introduces CrashFixer, the first LLM-based software repair agent that is applicable to Linux kernel bugs. Inspired by the typical workflow of a kernel developer, we identify the key capabilities an expert developer leverages to resolve a kernel crash. Using this as our guide, we revisit the kGym platform and identify key system improvements needed to practically run LLM-based agents at the scale of the Linux kernel (50K files and 20M lines of code). We implement these changes by extending kGym to create an improved platform - called kGymSuite, which will be open-sourced. Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of various repair strategies for such complex kernel bugs and showcases the value of explicitly generating a hypothesis before attempting to fix bugs in complex systems such as the Linux kernel. We also evaluated CrashFixer's capabilities on still open bugs, and found at least two patch suggestions considered plausible to resolve the reported bug.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive research on Q&A sites, being a high-level and important type of development-related knowledge, architectural solutions and their reuse are rarely explored. To fill this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study that includes a mining study and a survey study. For the mining study, we mined 984 commits and issues from 893 OSS projects on GitHub that explicitly referenced architectural solutions from SO and SWESE. For the survey study, we identified practitioners involved in the reuse of these architectural solutions and surveyed 227 of them to further understand how practitioners reuse architectural solutions from Q&A sites in their OSS development. Our findings: (1) OSS practitioners use architectural solutions from Q&A sites to solve a large variety of architectural problems, wherein Component design issue, Architectural anti-pattern, and Security issue are dominant; (2) Seven categories of architectural solutions from Q&A sites have been reused to solve those problems, among which Architectural refactoring, Use of frameworks, and Architectural tactic are the three most reused architectural solutions; (3) OSS developers often rely on ad hoc ways (e.g., informal, improvised, or unstructured approaches) to incorporate architectural solutions from SO, drawing on personal experience and intuition rather than standardized or systematic practices; (4) Using architectural solutions from SO comes with a variety of challenges, e.g., OSS practitioners complain that they need to spend significant time to adapt such architectural solutions to address design concerns raised in their OSS development, and it is challenging to use architectural solutions that are not tailored to the design context of their OSS projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08379v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance individual productivity in guided settings. Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>JEL C...</summary><p>JEL Classification: O31, C88, J24, O35, L86</p></details> |
| **[Grouptuner: Efficient Group-Aware Compiler Auto-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08598v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern compilers typically provide hundreds of options to optimize program performance, but users often cannot fully leverage them due to the huge number of options. While standard optimization combinations (e.g., -O3) provide reasonable defaults, they often fail to deliver near-peak performance across diverse programs and architectures. To address this challenge, compiler auto-tuning techniques have emerged to automate the discovery of improved option combinations. Existing techniques typically focus on identifying critical options and prioritizing them during the search to improve efficiency. However, due to limited tuning iterations, the resulting data is often sparse and noisy, making it highly challenging to accurately identify critical options. As a result, these algorithms are prone to being trapped in local optima. To address this limitation, we propose GroupTuner, a group-aware auto-tuning technique that directly applies localized mutation to coherent option groups based on historically best-performing combinations, thus avoiding explicitly identifying critical options. By forgoing the need to know precisely which options are most important, GroupTuner maximizes the use of existing performance data, ensuring more targeted exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTuner can efficiently discover competitive option combinations, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.39% over -O3 while requiring only 77.21% of the time compared to the random search algorithm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in the ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES'25), June 16-17, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea</p></details> |
| **[CursorCore: Assist Programming through Aligning Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07002v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have been successfully applied to programming assistance tasks, such as code completion, code insertion, and instructional code editing. However, these applications remain insufficiently automated and struggle to effectively integrate various types of information during the programming process, including coding history, current code, and user instructions. In this work, we propose a new conversational framework that comprehensively integrates these information sources, collect data to train our models and evaluate their performance. Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well models align with different types of information and the quality of their outputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to comprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance tasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline, Programming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources, such as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically generate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally, using this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and develop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models of comparable size. This framework unifies applications such as inline chat and automated editing, contributes to the advancement of coding assistants. Code, models and data are freely available at https://github.com/TechxGenus/CursorCore.</p></details> |  |

For instance, hard-coded credentials planted in the code of a file server application would enable maliciously logging into all deployed instances of this application. Confirmed software supply chain attacks have led to the injection of backdoors into popular open-source projects, and backdoors have been discovered in various router firmware. Manual code auditing for backdoors is challenging and existing semi-automated approaches can handle only a limited scope of programs and backdoors, while requiring manual reverse-engineering of the audited (binary) program. Graybox fuzzing (automated semi-randomized testing) has grown in popularity due to its success in discovering vulnerabilities and hence stands as a strong candidate for improved backdoor detection. However, current fuzzing knowledge does not offer any means to detect the triggering of a backdoor at runtime. In this work we introduce ROSA, a novel approach (and tool) which combines a state-of-the-art fuzzer (AFL++) with a new metamorphic test oracle, capable of detecting runtime backdoor triggers. To facilitate the evaluation of ROSA, we have created ROSARUM, the first openly available benchmark for assessing the detection of various backdoors in diverse programs. Experimental evaluation shows that ROSA has a level of robustness, speed and automation similar to classical fuzzing. It finds all 17 authentic or synthetic backdooors from ROSARUM in 1h30 on average. Compared to existing detection tools, it can handle a diversity of backdoors and programs and it does not rely on manual reverse-engineering of the fuzzed binary code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination by Code Generation LLMs: Taxonomy, Benchmarks, Mitigation, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20799v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent technical breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have enabled them to fluently generate source code. Software developers often leverage both general-purpose and code-specialized LLMs to revise existing code or even generate a whole function from scratch. These capabilities are also beneficial in no-code or low-code contexts, in which one can write programs without a technical background. However, due to their internal design, LLMs are prone to generating hallucinations, which are incorrect, nonsensical, and not justifiable information but difficult to identify its presence. This problem also occurs when generating source code. Once hallucinated code is produced, it is often challenging for users to identify and fix it, especially when such hallucinations can be identified under specific execution paths. As a result, the hallucinated code may remain unnoticed within the codebase. This survey investigates recent studies and techniques relevant to hallucinations generated by CodeLLMs. We categorize the types of hallucinations in the code generated by CodeLLMs, review existing benchmarks and mitigation strategies, and identify open challenges. Based on these findings, this survey outlines further research directions in the detection and removal of hallucinations produced by CodeLLMs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Detecting the Root Cause Code Lines in Bug-Fixing Commits by Heterogeneous Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01022v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous growth in the scale and complexity of software systems, defect remediation has become increasingly difficult and costly. Automated defect prediction tools can proactively identify software changes prone to defects within software projects, thereby enhancing software development efficiency. However, existing work in heterogeneous and complex software projects continues to face challenges, such as struggling with heterogeneous commit structures and ignoring cross-line dependencies in code changes, which ultimately reduce the accuracy of defect identification. To address these challenges, we propose an approach called RC_Detector. RC_Detector comprises three main components: the bug-fixing graph construction component, the code semantic aggregation component, and the cross-line semantic retention component. The bug-fixing graph construction component identifies the code syntax structures and program dependencies within bug-fixing commits and transforms them into heterogeneous graph formats by converting the source code into vector representations. The code semantic aggregation component adapts to heterogeneous data by using heterogeneous attention to learn the hidden semantic representation of target code lines. The cross-line semantic retention component regulates propagated semantic information by using attenuation and reinforcement gates derived from old and new code semantic representations, effectively preserving cross-line semantic relationships. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our model by collecting data from 87 open-source projects, including 675 bug-fixing commits. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements of 83.15%,96.83%,78.71%,74.15%,54.14%,91.66%,91.66%, and 34.82% in MFR, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines why traditional code plagiarism detection methods frequently fail in these environments and explores the implications of emerging factors such as generative AI (genAI). Drawing on the author's experience teaching a Competitive Programming 1 (CP1) course over seven semesters at Purdue University (with $\approx 100$ students each term) and completely redesigning the CP1/2/3 course sequence, we provide an academically grounded analysis. We review literature on code plagiarism in computer science education, survey current detection tools (Moss, Kattis, etc.) and methods (manual review, code-authorship interviews), and analyze their strengths and limitations. Experience-based observations are presented to illustrate real-world detection failures and successes. We find that widely-used automated similarity checkers can be thwarted by simple code transformations or novel AI-generated code, while human-centric approaches like oral interviews, though effective, are labor-intensive. The paper concludes with opinions and preliminary recommendations for improving academic integrity in programming courses, advocating for a multi-faceted approach that combines improved detection algorithms, mastery-based learning techniques, and authentic assessment practices to better ensure code originality.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |

However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before. Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation. Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis. Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach. Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Byam: Fixing Breaking Dependency Updates with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07522v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) facilitate the integration of third-party dependencies within the code of client applications. However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code. These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We experiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p></details> |  |

It is motivated by the need for multi-language software development and legacy system migration. In recent years, neural code translation has gained significant attention, driven by rapid advancements in deep learning and large language models. Researchers have proposed various techniques to improve neural code translation quality. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive systematic literature review has been conducted to summarize the key techniques and challenges in this field. To fill this research gap, we collected 57 primary studies covering the period 2020~2025 on neural code translation. These studies are analyzed from seven key perspectives: task characteristics, data preprocessing, code modeling, model construction, post-processing, evaluation subjects, and evaluation metrics. Our analysis reveals current research trends, identifies unresolved challenges, and shows potential directions for future work. These findings can provide valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the field of neural code translation.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, existing methods are predominantly limited to specific programming languages, restricting their applicability in multilingual settings. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities and enhanced semantic understanding, presenting a potential solution to this limitation. While existing studies have explored LLMs for vulnerability detection, their detection performance remains unknown for multilingual vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conducted a preliminary study to evaluate the effectiveness of PLMs and state-of-the-art LLMs across seven popular programming languages. Our findings reveal that the PLM CodeT5P achieves the best performance in multilingual vulnerability detection, particularly in identifying the most critical vulnerabilities. Based on these results, we further discuss the potential of LLMs in advancing real-world multilingual vulnerability detection. This work represents an initial step toward exploring PLMs and LLMs for cross-language vulnerability detection, offering key insights for future research and practical deployment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Synthetic Code Surgery: Repairing Bugs and Vulnerabilities with LLMs and Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07372v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel methodology for enhancing Automated Program Repair (APR) through synthetic data generation utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of high-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple programming languages. The proposed approach addresses this limitation through a two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous quality assessment. Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate approximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12 programming languages and 13 bug categories. Subsequently, these samples underwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code quality, security, performance, and completeness. Experimental evaluation on the VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in Perfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset outperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in certain scenarios. The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical testing, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference analysis. Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing systems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy. This research establishes a self-bootstrapping paradigm in which LLMs generate and evaluate their own training data, potentially transforming approaches to data scarcity across software engineering tasks and advancing the development of robust, adaptable tools for automated code maintenance.</p></details> |  |

As large language models (LLMs) continue to excel in diverse language understanding and generation tasks, their potential in decoding complex binary data structures becomes evident. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks in this domain limits the assessment and comparison of LLM's capabilities in binary analysis and hinders the progress of research and practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce BinMetric, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the performance of large language models on binary analysis tasks. BinMetric comprises 1,000 questions derived from 20 real-world open-source projects across 6 practical binary analysis tasks, including decompilation, code summarization, assembly instruction generation, etc., which reflect actual reverse engineering scenarios. Our empirical study on this benchmark investigates the binary analysis capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing their strengths and limitations in this field. The findings indicate that while LLMs show strong potential, challenges still exist, particularly in the areas of precise binary lifting and assembly synthesis. In summary, BinMetric makes a significant step forward in measuring the binary analysis capabilities of LLMs, establishing a new benchmark leaderboard, and our study provides valuable insights for the future development of these LLMs in software security.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Automated Repair of Ambiguous Natural Language Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07270v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has amplified the role of natural language (NL) in software engineering, and its inherent ambiguity and susceptibility to misinterpretation pose a fundamental challenge for software quality, because employing ambiguous requirements may result in the generation of faulty programs. The complexity of ambiguity detection and resolution motivates us to introduce the problem of automated repair of ambiguous NL requirements. Repairing ambiguity in requirements poses a challenge for LLMs, as it demands a metacognitive capability - the ability to reflect on how alterations to the text influence their own interpretation of this text. Indeed, our experiments show that directly prompting an LLM to detect and resolve ambiguities results in irrelevant or inconsistent clarifications. Our key novelty is in decomposing this problem into simpler subproblems which do not require metacognitive reasoning. First, we analyze and repair LLM's interpretation of requirements embodied in the distribution of programs they induce using traditional testing and program repair methods. Second, we repair requirements based on the changes to the distribution via what we refer to as contractive specification inference. This decomposition enables targeted, minimal requirement repairs that yield cross-model performance gains in code generation. We implemented this approach in a tool SpecFix, and evaluated it using three SOTA LLMs, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen2.5-Coder-32b-Instruct, across two widely-used code generation benchmarks: HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Our results show that SpecFix, operating autonomously without human intervention or external information, outputs repaired requirements that, when used by LLMs for code generation, increase the Pass@1 score by 4.3%, and help LLMs to solve 3.4% more problems via majority vote.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Black-box Testing Framework for Oracle Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07243v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oracle quantum programs are a fundamental class of quantum programs that serve as a critical bridge between quantum computing and classical computing. Many important quantum algorithms are built upon oracle quantum programs, making it essential to ensure their correctness during development. While software testing is a well-established approach for improving program reliability, no systematic method has been developed to test oracle quantum programs. This paper proposes a black-box testing framework designed for general oracle quantum programs. We define these programs formally, establish the foundational theory for their testing, and propose a detailed testing framework. We develop a prototype tool and conduct extensive experimental evaluations to evaluate the framework's effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly aids developers in testing oracle quantum programs, providing insights to enhance the reliability of quantum software.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |
| **[An Empirical Study: MEMS as a Static Performance Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07208v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static performance estimation is essential during compile-time analysis, yet traditional runtime-based methods are costly and platform-dependent. We investigate mems, the number of memory accesses, as a static and architecture-independent performance metric. We develop a Clang-based automated instrumentation tool that rewrites source code to insert path tracing and \textit{mems} counting logic. This allows us to evaluate mems-based performance estimation across ten classical algorithm programs. Experimental results show that within the same program, execution paths with higher mems values consistently exhibit longer runtime. However, this correlation weakens between different programs, suggesting that mems is best suited for comparing performance of different execution paths in a program.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incremental Analysis of Legacy Applications Using Knowledge Graphs for Application Modernization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06885v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industries such as banking, telecom, and airlines - o6en have large so6ware systems that are several decades old. Many of these systems are written in old programming languages such as COBOL, PL/1, Assembler, etc. In many cases, the documentation is not updated, and those who developed/designed these systems are no longer around. Understanding these systems for either modernization or even regular maintenance has been a challenge. An extensive application may have natural boundaries based on its code dependencies and architecture. There are also other logical boundaries in an enterprise setting driven by business functions, data domains, etc. Due to these complications, the system architects generally plan their modernization across these logical boundaries in parts, thereby adopting an incremental approach for the modernization journey of the entire system. In this work, we present a so6ware system analysis tool that allows a subject ma=er expert (SME) or system architect to analyze a large so6ware system incrementally. We analyze the source code and other artifacts (such as data schema) to create a knowledge graph using a customizable ontology/schema. Entities and relations in our ontology can be defined for any combination of programming languages and platforms. Using this knowledge graph, the analyst can then define logical boundaries around dependent Entities (e.g. Programs, Transactions, Database Tables etc.). Our tool then presents different views showcasing the dependencies from the newly defined boundary to/from the other logical groups of the system. This exercise is repeated interactively to 1) Identify the Entities and groupings of interest for a modernization task and 2) Understand how a change in one part of the system may affect the other parts. To validate the efficacy of our tool, we provide an initial study of our system on two client applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking and Revisiting Code Generation Assessment: A Mutation-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06880v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (CLLMs) have exhibited outstanding performance in program synthesis, attracting the focus of the research community. The evaluation of CLLM's program synthesis capability has generally relied on manually curated benchmarks. However, there is a substantial gap between real-world scenarios and benchmark settings. Existing benchmarks typically provide only a single input prompt for the evaluation of each synthesis problem. However, in practice, a problem can be described in various ways, including with typos, where developers may struggle to understand certain descriptions and seek clarification to find more suitable wording. Such various descriptions may lead to variations in the performance of CLLMs on the same question, resulting in a biased evaluation when using existing benchmarks. In this paper, we aim to explore these pitfalls with the goal of revisiting and enhancing future benchmark designs. To simulate real-world variations in problem descriptions, we propose 10 mutation strategies and introduce three new metrics to evaluate their impact on code generation. We then assess five popular CLLMs using 12,834 generated prompt variants, and found a significant performance discrepancy between the results from existing benchmarks and those from mutated benchmarks containing perturbations and variations. This finding underscores the need for more robust evaluation methods and benchmarks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

This paper proposes the concept of maturity to fill this gap and introduces the Grant Maturity Framework (GMF), a mixed-methods model for evaluating the maturity of Web3 grant programs. The GMF provides a systematic approach to assessing the structure, governance, and impact of Web3 grants, applied here to four prominent Ethereum layer-two (L2) grant programs: Arbitrum, Optimism, Mantle, and Taiko. By evaluating these programs using the GMF, the study categorizes them into four maturity stages, ranging from experimental to advanced. The findings reveal that Arbitrum's Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP) and Optimism's Mission Rounds show higher maturity, while Mantle and Taiko are still in their early stages. The research concludes by discussing the user-centric development of a Web3 grant management platform aimed at improving the maturity and effectiveness of Web3 grant management processes based on the findings from the GMF. This work contributes to both practical and theoretical knowledge on Web3 grant program evaluation and tooling, providing a valuable resource for Web3 grant operators and stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

Resource allocation is an important step of the development process that can influence the quality of the designed system. As the design space is large and complex, intuitive design can turn into a time-consuming process with sub-optimal solutions. Here, we present an approach to automatically map software components to available hardware resources. Compared to existing frameworks, our method provides a wider range of safety analyses in compliance with the ISO 26262 standard, encompassing aspects such as reliability, task scheduling, and automotive safety integrity level (ASIL) compatibility. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP)-based approach to perform the ASIL decomposition technique specified by the standard. This technique proves beneficial when suitable hardware resources are unavailable for a safety-critical application. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize both the development cost and the maximum execution times of critical function chains. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is investigated on an exemplary case study, and the results of the performance analysis are presented and discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Formal Verification Approach to Safeguard Controller Variables from Single Event Upset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06648v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method based on program analysis and formal verification to identify conditionally relevant variables (CRVs) - variables which could lead to violation of safety properties in control software when affected by single event upsets (SEUs). Traditional static analysis can distinguish between relevant and irrelevant variables. However, it would fail to take into account the conditions specific to the control software in question. This can lead to false positives. Our algorithm employs formal verification to avoid false positives. We have conducted experiments that demonstrate that CRVs indeed are fewer in number than what traditional static analysis can detect and that our algorithm is able to identify this fact. The information provided by our algorithm could prove helpful to a compiler while it does register allocation during the compilation of the control software. In turn, this could cause significant reduction in the cost of controller chips.</p></details> |  |

However, these models require significant computational resources for training and fine-tuning, posing challenges for real-world adoption in resource-constrained environments. To address this, the research community has increasingly turned to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)-a class of techniques that enables the adaptation of large models by updating only a small subset of parameters, rather than the entire model. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we examine the growing application of PEFT techniques-across a wide range of software engineering tasks. We analyze how these methods are used to optimize various deep learning (DL) architectures, focusing on their impact on both performance and efficiency. Our study synthesizes findings from 27 peer-reviewed papers, identifying patterns in configuration strategies and adaptation trade-offs. The outcome of this review is a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes PEFT usage by task type, distinguishing between generative (e.g., Code Summarization) and non-generative (e.g., Code Clone Detection) scenarios. Our findings aim to inform future research and guide the practical deployment of PEFT in sustainable, AI-powered software development.

Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains challenging. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp combines coverage analysis, code context, and feedback in prompts that iteratively guide the LLM to generate tests that improve line and branch coverage. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation- and LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 89% (vs. 77%). We also demonstrate that CoverUp's performance stems not only from the LLM used but from the combined effectiveness of its components.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages; to appear at FSE'25</p></details> |

With its increasing importance and historical reliance on uncompensated contributions, questions have been raised regarding the continuous maintenance of FOSS and its implications from a security perspective. In recent years, different funding programs have emerged to provide external incentives to reinforce community FOSS' sustainability. Past research primarily focused on analyses what type of projects have been funded and for what reasons. However, it has neither been considered whether there is a need for such external incentives, nor whether the incentive mechanisms, especially with the development of decentralized approaches, are susceptible to fraud. In this study, we explore the need for funding through a literature review and compare the susceptibility to fraud of centralized and decentralized incentive programs by performing case studies on the Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) and the tea project. We find non-commercial incentives to fill an important gap, ensuring longevity and sustainability of projects. Furthermore, we find the STF to be able to achieve a high resilience against fraud attempts, while tea is highly susceptible to fraud, as evidenced by revelation of an associated sybil attack on npm. Our results imply that special considerations must be taken into account when utilizing quantitative repository metrics regardless whether spoofing is expected.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ARES 2025</p></details> |
| **[PR2: Peephole Raw Pointer Rewriting with LLMs for Translating C to Safer Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04852v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the automatically generated test input does not always make sense, and the automated assertion is difficult to validate against the program under test. In this paper, we propose JustinANN, a flexible and scalable tool to generate test cases for Java programs, providing realistic test inputs and assertions. We have observed that, in practice, Java programs contain a large number of annotations from programs, which can be considered as part of the user specification. We design a systematic annotation set with 7 kinds of annotations and 4 combination rules based on them to modify complex Java objects. Annotations that modify the fields or return variables of methods can be used to generate assertions that represent the true intent of the program, and the ones that modify the input parameters can be used to generate test inputs that match the real business requirement. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the approach on open source Java programs. The results show that the annotations and their combinations designed in this paper are compatible with existing annotations; our approach is easier to generate test data in, on and outside the boundaries of the requirement domain; and it also helps to find program defects.</p></details> |  |

However, effective vulnerability detection relies on accurately capturing the semantic structure of code and its contextual relationships. Given that the same functionality can be implemented in various forms, a preprocessing tool that standardizes code representation is important. This tool must be efficient, adaptable across programming languages, and capable of supporting new transformations. To address this challenge, we build on the existing SCoPE framework and introduce SCoPE2, an enhanced version with improved performance. We compare both versions in terms of processing time and memory usage and evaluate their impact on a Large Language Model (LLM) for vulnerability detection. Our results show a 97.3\% reduction in processing time with SCoPE2, along with an improved F1-score for the LLM, solely due to the refined preprocessing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 tables, DCAI'25: Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2025</p></details> |

However, its application often results in overly large test suites, as developers generate numerous tests to kill specific mutants, increasing computational overhead. This paper introduces PRIMG (Prioritization and Refinement Integrated Mutation-driven Generation), a novel framework for incremental and adaptive test case generation for Solidity smart contracts. PRIMG integrates two core components: a mutation prioritization module, which employs a machine learning model trained on mutant subsumption graphs to predict the usefulness of surviving mutants, and a test case generation module, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and iteratively refine test cases to achieve syntactic and behavioral correctness. We evaluated PRIMG on real-world Solidity projects from Code4Arena to assess its effectiveness in improving mutation scores and generating high-quality test cases. The experimental results demonstrate that PRIMG significantly reduces test suite size while maintaining high mutation coverage. The prioritization module consistently outperformed random mutant selection, enabling the generation of high-impact tests with reduced computational effort. Furthermore, the refining process enhanced the correctness and utility of LLM-generated tests, addressing their inherent limitations in handling edge cases and complex program logic.</p></details> |  |

The absence of comprehensive best practices for feature toggle usage often results in improper implementation, causing code quality issues. Although certain feature toggle usage patterns are prone to toggle smells, there is no tool as of today for software engineers to detect toggle usage patterns from the source code. This paper presents a tool TS-Detector to detect five different toggle usage patterns across ten open-source software projects in six different programming languages. We conducted a manual evaluation and results show that the true positive rates of detecting Spread, Nested, and Dead toggles are 80%, 86.4%, and 66.6% respectively, and the true negative rate of Mixed and Enum usages was 100%.

Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

Despite their impressive capabilities, they still face practical deployment issues, such as high inference costs, limited accessibility of proprietary LCMs, and adaptability issues of ultra-large LCMs. These issues highlight the critical need for more accessible, lightweight yet effective LCMs. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, which transfers the programming capabilities of larger, advanced LCMs to smaller, less powerful LCMs. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Paced knOwledge DistillAtion framework, named SODA, aiming at developing lightweight yet effective student LCMs. SODA consists of three stages in one cycle: (1) Correct-and-Fault Knowledge Delivery stage aims at improving the student models capability to recognize errors while ensuring its basic programming skill during the knowledge transferring, which involves correctness-aware supervised learning and fault-aware contrastive learning methods. (2) Multi-View Feedback stage aims at measuring the quality of results generated by the student model from two views, including model-based and static tool-based measurement, for identifying the difficult questions. (3) Feedback-based Knowledge Update stage aims at updating the student model adaptively by generating new questions at different difficulty levels, in which the difficulty levels are categorized based on the feedback in the second stage. Experimental results show that SODA improves the student model by 65.96% in terms of average Pass@1, outperforming the best baseline by 29.85%. Based on the SODA framework, we develop SodaCoder, a series of lightweight yet effective LCMs, which outperform 15 LCMs with less than or equal to 16B parameters. Notably, SodaCoder-DS-6.7B, built on DeepseekCoder-6.7B, even surpasses the prominent ChatGPT on average Pass@1.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 |

To address this challenge, we propose ReadMe$.$LLM, LLM-oriented documentation for software libraries. By attaching the contents of ReadMe$.$LLM to a query, performance consistently improves to near-perfect accuracy, with one case study demonstrating up to 100% success across all tested models. We propose a software development lifecycle where LLM-specific documentation is maintained alongside traditional software updates. In this study, we present two practical applications of the ReadMe$.$LLM idea with diverse software libraries, highlighting that our proposed approach could generalize across programming domains.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |

However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.</p></details> |  |

However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/SceneGenAgent .</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Modeling Language Code Generation from Diagram Images Using Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12293v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Unified Modeling Language is a standardized visual language widely used for modeling and documenting the design of software systems. Although many tools generate UML diagrams from UML code, generating executable UML code from image-based UML diagrams remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach to generate UML code using a large multimodal language model automatically. Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models. The experiments measured code generation accuracy across different model sizes and training strategies. These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams. This will enable the modernization of legacy systems and decrease the manual effort in software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Journal of Machine Learning with Applications, Author Contributions: Averi Bates: Methodology, Development, Analysis, Data Curation, Drafting, Review.

While platform evolution and smart contracts' inherent immutability necessitate migrations both across and within chains, migrating the vast amounts of critical data in these contracts while maintaining data integrity and minimizing operational disruption presents a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we present SmartShift, a framework that enables secure and efficient smart contract migrations through intelligent state partitioning and progressive function activation, preserving operational continuity during transitions. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartShift significantly reduces migration downtime while ensuring robust security, establishing a foundation for efficient and secure smart contract migration systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Robust in Understanding Code Against Semantics-Preserving Mutations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10443v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Repetition Problems of LLMs in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10402v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |
| **[Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful for Java Function Bug Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10375v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, managing the configuration differences between these two environments can be challenging, leading to inconsistent behavior, unexpected errors, and increased downtime. Objective: In this study, we sought to investigate the strategies software companies employ to mitigate the configuration differences between the development and production environments. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these strategies used to contribute to reducing the risk of configuration-related issues. Method: To achieve this goal, we interviewed 17 participants and leveraged the Thematic Analysis methodology to analyze the interview data. These participants shed some light on the current practices, processes, challenges, or issues they have encountered. Results: Based on the interviews, we systematically formulated and structured a catalog of eight strategies that explain how software producing companies mitigate these configuration differences. These strategies vary from 1) creating detailed configuration management plans, 2) using automation tools, and 3) developing processes to test and validate changes through containers and virtualization technologies. Conclusion: By implementing these strategies, companies can improve their ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the production environment. In addition, they can also ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on the environmental craze on social media platforms and its impact on young activists aged 16-25. With the advancement of social media, new avenues have opened for participation in sustainability issues, especially for the marginalized, as information moved through transnational networks at lightning speed. Along with specific Formative Visual Storytelling methods, the young leaders of the movement deploy hashtags and other online tools to capture the attention of their peers and decision makers. Challenges persist with "clicktivism" fatigue from the internet, and site limitations. This article contributes to insights on emerging forms of civic activism by explaining how digital natives adapt technology to reframe green activism. The research suggests that effective digital environmental movements integrate online and offline action, make it simple for individuals to get involved, and promote tolerance to algorithmic modifications and climate care among participants.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Drawing from an Action Research case study at a global Swedish enterprise, we identify and address critical barriers such as departmental fragmentation, regulatory constraints, and organizational inertia that can impede successful AI transformation. X-FAIT employs force field analysis, executive sponsorship, cross-functional integration, and systematic risk assessment strategies to coordinate efforts across organizational boundaries, facilitating knowledge sharing and ensuring AI initiatives align with objectives. The framework provides both theoretical insights into AI-driven organizational transformation and practical guidance for software organizations aiming to effectively integrate AI into their daily workflows and, longer-term, products.</p></details> | 4 pages |

This has thus caused a spotlight to be paced on these resources, where researchers have reported mixed outcomes around the quality of these resources. Stack Overflow, in particular, has been studied extensively, with evidence showing that code resources on this platform can be of poor quality at times. Limited research has explored the variables or factors that predict code quality on Stack Overflow, but instead has focused on ranking content, identifying defects and predicting future content. In many instances approaches used for prediction are not evaluated to identify the best techniques. Contextualizing the Stack Overflow code quality problem as regression-based, we examined the variables that predict Stack Overflow (Java) code quality, and the regression approach that provides the best predictive power. Six approaches were considered in our evaluation, where Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) stood out. In addition, longer Stack Overflow code tended to have more code violations, questions that were scored higher also attracted more views and the more answers that are added to questions on Stack Overflow the more errors were typically observed in the code that was provided. Outcomes here point to the value of the GBM ensemble learning mechanism, and the need for the practitioner community to be prudent when contributing and reusing Stack Overflow Java coding resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Objective: Despite the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in various software engineering tasks, their effectiveness in SVA remains underexplored. Method: To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach SVA-ICL, which leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM performance. Our approach involves the selection of high-quality demonstrations for ICL through information fusion, incorporating both source code and vulnerability descriptions. For source code, we consider semantic, lexical, and syntactic similarities, while for vulnerability descriptions, we focus on textual similarity. Based on the selected demonstrations, we construct context prompts and consider DeepSeek-V2 as the LLM for SVA-ICL. Results: We evaluate the effectiveness of SVA-ICL using a large-scale dataset comprising 12,071 C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SVA-ICL outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC measures. Furthermore, ablation studies highlight the significance of component customization in SVA-ICL, such as the number of demonstrations, the demonstration ordering strategy, and the optimal fusion ratio of different modalities. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that leveraging ICL with information fusion can effectively improve the effectiveness of LLM-based SVA, warranting further research in this direction.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, user models do not seem to be part of standard modeling languages nor common in current model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to analyze existing proposals for user modeling in MDE and identify their limitations. The results showcase that there is a lack of a unified and complete user modeling perspective. Instead, we observe a lot of fragmented and partial proposals considering only simple user dimensions and with lack of proper tool support. This limits the implementation of richer user interfaces able to better support the user-specific needs. Therefore, we hope this analysis triggers a discussion on the importance of user models and their inclusion in MDE pipelines. Especially in a context where, thanks to the rise of AI techniques, personalization, based on a rich number of user dimensions, is becoming more and more of a possibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Bisimulation for Parameterized Anonymity and Uniformity Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09963v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bisimulation is crucial for verifying process equivalence in probabilistic systems. This paper presents a novel logical framework for analyzing bisimulation in probabilistic parameterized systems, namely, infinite families of finite-state probabilistic systems. Our framework is built upon the first-order theory of regular structures, which provides a decidable logic for reasoning about these systems. We show that essential properties like anonymity and uniformity can be encoded and verified within this framework in a manner aligning with the principles of deductive software verification, where systems, properties, and proofs are expressed in a unified decidable logic. By integrating language inference techniques, we achieve full automation in synthesizing candidate bisimulation proofs for anonymity and uniformity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by addressing several challenging examples, including cryptographic protocols and randomized algorithms that were previously beyond the reach of fully automated methods.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made it possible to generate front-end Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code directly from webpage designs. However, real-world webpages encompass not only a diverse array of HTML tags but also complex stylesheets, resulting in significantly lengthy code. The lengthy code poses challenges for the performance and efficiency of MLLMs, especially in capturing the structural information of UI designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes UICopilot, a novel approach to automating UI synthesis via hierarchical code generation from webpage designs. The core idea of UICopilot is to decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating the coarse-grained HTML hierarchical structure, followed by the generation of fine-grained code. To validate the effectiveness of UICopilot, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, i.e., WebCode2M. Experimental results demonstrate that UICopilot significantly outperforms existing baselines in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, statistical analysis reveals that the majority of human annotators prefer the webpages generated by UICopilot over those produced by GPT-4V.</p></details> | WWW' 2025 |

Developers work tirelessly to ensure that their applications are both functional and user-friendly. In pursuit of this, Automated Input Generation (AIG) tools have emerged as a promising solution for testing mobile applications by simulating user interactions and exploring app functionalities. However, these tools face significant challenges in navigating complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), and developers often have trouble understanding their output. More specifically, AIG tools face difficulties in navigating out of certain screens, such as login pages and advertisements, due to a lack of contextual understanding which leads to suboptimal testing coverage. Furthermore, while AIG tools can provide interaction traces consisting of action and screen details, there is limited understanding of its coverage of higher level functionalities, such as logging in, setting alarms, or saving notes. Understanding these covered use cases are essential to ensure comprehensive test coverage of app functionalities. Difficulty in testing mobile UIs can lead to the design of complex interfaces, which can adversely affect users of advanced age who often face usability barriers due to small buttons, cluttered layouts, and unintuitive navigation. There exists many studies that highlight these issues, but automated solutions for improving UI accessibility needs more attention. This research seeks to enhance automated UI testing techniques by learning the screen usage semantics of mobile apps and helping them navigate more efficiently, offer more insights about tested functionalities and also improve the usability of a mobile app's interface by identifying and mitigating UI design issues.</p></details> |  |

It complements previous theoretical work published by existing developers of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) on the overall engineering practices and methodologies for readiness determination. Readiness determination is, at its core, a risk assessment process. It is aimed at evaluating the residual risk associated with the deployment of a new software release candidate. The paper proposes methodological criteria to ground the readiness review process for an ADS release. While informed by Waymo's experience in this domain, the criteria presented are agnostic of any specific ADS technological solution and/or architectural choice, to support broad implementation by others in the industry. The paper continues with a discussion on governance and decision-making toward approval of a new software release candidate for the ADS. The implementation of the presented criteria requires the existence of appropriate safety management practices in addition to many other cultural, procedural, and operational considerations. As such, the paper is concluded by a statement of limitations for those wishing to replicate part or all of its content.</p></details> |  |

This research evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automatically generating test cases, comparing them with manual tests. An optimized prompt was developed, that integrates code and requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements. Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This work highlights the importance of manual qualitative analysis as an essential complement to automation in unit test evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision at Jornadas de Cloud Computing, Big Data & Emerging Topics (JCC-BD&ET) - 2025</p></details> |

In response, researchers and practitioners have developed tools to detect and reduce undesired bias, commonly referred to as fairness tools. Many of these tools are publicly available for free use and adaptation. While the growing availability of such tools is promising, little is known about the broader landscape beyond well-known examples like AI Fairness 360 and Fairlearn. Because fairness is an ongoing concern, these tools must be built for long-term sustainability. Using an existing set of fairness tools as a reference, we systematically searched GitHub and identified 50 related projects. We then analyzed various aspects of their repositories to assess community engagement and the extent of ongoing maintenance. Our findings show diverse forms of engagement with these tools, suggesting strong support for open-source development. However, we also found significant variation in how well these tools are maintained. Notably, 53 percent of fairness projects become inactive within the first three years. By examining sustainability in fairness tooling, we aim to promote more stability and growth in this critical area.</p></details> |  |

This approach is particularly valuable for scientific computing applications in which comprehensive tests are needed to prevent flawed results or conclusions. As scientific discovery becomes increasingly more complex, domain scientists couple multiple scientific computing models or simulations to solve intricate multiphysics and multiscale problems. These model-coupling applications use a hardwired coupling program or a flexible web service to link and combine different models. In this paper, we focus on the quality assurance of the more elastic web service via a combination of rigorous specification and testing methods. The application of statistical testing exposes problems ignored by pre-written unit tests and highlights areas in the code where failures might occur. We certify the model-coupling server controller with a derived reliability statistic, offering a quantitative measure to support a claim of its robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to SEKE2025</p></details> |

There has been considerable discussion about the use of LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language, but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design, and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.</p></details> |  |

Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on problem-solving and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MIGRATION-BENCH with a distinct focus: code migration. MIGRATION-BENCH aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java 8 to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java 17, 21), MIGRATION-BENCH includes a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java 17. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves 62.33% and 27.00% success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience and https://github.com/amazon-science/self_debug respectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Understanding the Impact of Data Bugs on Deep Learning Models in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12137v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved significant success in various software engineering tasks (e.g., code completion by Copilot). However, DL systems are prone to bugs from many sources, including training data. Existing literature suggests that bugs in training data are highly prevalent, but little research has focused on understanding their impacts on the models used in software engineering tasks. In this paper, we address this research gap through a comprehensive empirical investigation focused on three types of data prevalent in software engineering tasks: code-based, text-based, and metric-based. Using state-of-the-art baselines, we compare the models trained on clean datasets with those trained on datasets with quality issues and without proper preprocessing. By analysing the gradients, weights, and biases from neural networks under training, we identify the symptoms of data quality and preprocessing issues. Our analysis reveals that quality issues in code data cause biased learning and gradient instability, whereas problems in text data lead to overfitting and poor generalisation of models. On the other hand, quality issues in metric data result in exploding gradients and model overfitting, and inadequate preprocessing exacerbates these effects across all three data types. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and generalizability of our findings using six new datasets. Our research provides a better understanding of the impact and symptoms of data bugs in software engineering datasets. Practitioners and researchers can leverage these findings to develop better monitoring systems and data-cleaning methods to help detect and resolve data bugs in deep learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Major Revision at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |

We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching 'Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated 'just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

| **[The Hidden Bloat in Machine Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14226v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bloat refers to code and features that is not used by a software during runtime. For Machine Learning (ML) systems, bloat is a major contributor to their technical debt leading to decreased performance and resource wastage. In this work, we present, Negativa-ML, a novel tool to identify and remove bloat in ML frameworks by analyzing their shared libraries. Our approach includes novel techniques to detect and locate unnecessary code within device code - a key area overlooked by existing research, which focuses primarily on host code. We evaluate Negativa-ML using four popular ML frameworks across ten workloads over 300 shared libraries. The results demonstrate that the ML frameworks are highly bloated on both the device and host code side. On average, Negativa-ML reduces the device code size in these frameworks by up to 75% and the host code by up to 72%, resulting in total file size reductions of up to 55%. The device code is a primary source of bloat within ML frameworks. Through debloating, we achieve reductions in peak host memory usage, peak GPU memory usage, and execution time by up to 74.6%, 69.6%, and 44.6%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, their misuse introduces vulnerabilities, potentially leading to severe data breaches and substantial financial loss. Complex API design, inadequate documentation, and insufficient security training often lead to unintentional misuse by developers. The software security community has devised and evaluated several approaches to detecting security API misuse to help developers and organizations. This study rigorously reviews the literature on detecting misuse of security APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of this critical domain. Our goal is to identify and analyze security API misuses, the detection approaches developed, and the evaluation methodologies employed along with the open research avenues to advance the state-of-the-art in this area. Employing the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, we analyzed 69 research papers. Our review has yielded (a) identification of 6 security API types; (b) classification of 30 distinct misuses; (c) categorization of detection techniques into heuristic-based and ML-based approaches; and (d) identification of 10 performance measures and 9 evaluation benchmarks. The review reveals a lack of coverage of detection approaches in several areas. We recommend that future efforts focus on aligning security API development with developers' needs and advancing standardized evaluation methods for detection technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM Computing Surveys, 2025</p></details> |

Not only are there many defects such as missing elements in the models created by learners during the exercises, but the layout of elements in the class diagrams often differs significantly from the correct answers created by the instructors. In this paper, we focus on the above problem and propose a method to provide effective support to learners during modeling exercises by automatically converting the layout of the learner's class diagram to that of the instructor, in addition to indicating the correctness of the artifacts to the learners during the exercises. The proposed method was implemented and evaluated as a tool, and the results indicate that the automatic layout conversion was an effective feedback to the learners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Prefix Tuning for Diverse and Accurate Code Summarization Using Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09062v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in source code summarization have leveraged transformer-based pre-trained models, including Large Language Models of Code (LLMCs), to automate and improve the generation of code summaries. However, existing methods often focus on generating a single high-quality summary for a given source code, neglecting scenarios where the generated summary might be inadequate and alternative options are needed. In this paper, we introduce Variational Prefix Tuning (VPT), a novel approach that enhances pre-trained models' ability to generate diverse yet accurate sets of summaries, allowing the user to choose the most suitable one for the given source code. Our method integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework as a modular component into pre-trained models, enabling us to model the distribution of observed target summaries and sample continuous embeddings to be used as prefixes to steer the generation of diverse outputs during decoding. Importantly, we construct our method in a parameter-efficient manner, eliminating the need for expensive model retraining, especially when using LLMCs. Furthermore, we employ a bi-criteria reranking method to select a subset of generated summaries, optimizing both the diversity and the accuracy of the options presented to users. We present extensive experimental evaluations using widely used datasets and current state-of-the-art pre-trained code summarization models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its adaptability across models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional approaches relying on natural language prompts, our benchmark emphasizes the ability of LLMs to interpret and implement functionality directly from test cases, reflecting real-world software development practices. Comprising 1000 diverse challenges across 20 application domains, the benchmark evaluates LLMs on their ability to generate compact, functional code under the constraints of context length and multi-feature complexity. Our findings highlight instruction following and in-context learning as critical capabilities for TDD success, surpassing the importance of general coding proficiency or pretraining knowledge. Through comprehensive evaluation of 19 frontier models, we reveal performance bottlenecks, such as instruction loss in long prompts, and provide a detailed error analysis spanning multiple root causes. This work underscores the practical value of TDD-specific benchmarks and lays the foundation for advancing LLM capabilities in rigorous, application-driven coding scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.05177</p></details> |

We conduct an empirical study followed by grounded theory qualitative analysis to determine the quality axes to improve. Then we propose a procedure using a Large Language Model (LLM) to rewrite existing code comments along the quality axes. We implement our procedure using GPT-4o, then distil the results into a smaller model capable of being run in-house, so users can maintain data custody. We evaluate both our approach using GPT-4o and the distilled model versions. We show in an evaluation how our procedure improves code comments along the quality axes. We release all data and source code in an online repository for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

In particular, they have demonstrated remarkable utility in the task of code repair. However, common benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of code LLMs are often limited to small-scale settings. In this work, we build upon kGym, which shares a benchmark for system-level Linux kernel bugs and a platform to run experiments on the Linux kernel. This paper introduces CrashFixer, the first LLM-based software repair agent that is applicable to Linux kernel bugs. Inspired by the typical workflow of a kernel developer, we identify the key capabilities an expert developer leverages to resolve a kernel crash. Using this as our guide, we revisit the kGym platform and identify key system improvements needed to practically run LLM-based agents at the scale of the Linux kernel (50K files and 20M lines of code). We implement these changes by extending kGym to create an improved platform - called kGymSuite, which will be open-sourced. Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of various repair strategies for such complex kernel bugs and showcases the value of explicitly generating a hypothesis before attempting to fix bugs in complex systems such as the Linux kernel. We also evaluated CrashFixer's capabilities on still open bugs, and found at least two patch suggestions considered plausible to resolve the reported bug.</p></details> |  |

These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 191 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive research on Q&A sites, being a high-level and important type of development-related knowledge, architectural solutions and their reuse are rarely explored. To fill this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study that includes a mining study and a survey study. For the mining study, we mined 984 commits and issues from 893 OSS projects on GitHub that explicitly referenced architectural solutions from SO and SWESE. For the survey study, we identified practitioners involved in the reuse of these architectural solutions and surveyed 227 of them to further understand how practitioners reuse architectural solutions from Q&A sites in their OSS development. Our findings: (1) OSS practitioners use architectural solutions from Q&A sites to solve a large variety of architectural problems, wherein Component design issue, Architectural anti-pattern, and Security issue are dominant; (2) Seven categories of architectural solutions from Q&A sites have been reused to solve those problems, among which Architectural refactoring, Use of frameworks, and Architectural tactic are the three most reused architectural solutions; (3) OSS developers often rely on ad hoc ways (e.g., informal, improvised, or unstructured approaches) to incorporate architectural solutions from SO, drawing on personal experience and intuition rather than standardized or systematic practices; (4) Using architectural solutions from SO comes with a variety of challenges, e.g., OSS practitioners complain that they need to spend significant time to adapt such architectural solutions to address design concerns raised in their OSS development, and it is challenging to use architectural solutions that are not tailored to the design context of their OSS projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08379v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance individual productivity in guided settings. Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>JEL C...</summary><p>JEL Classification: O31, C88, J24, O35, L86</p></details> |

With the rise of large language model (LLM)-based tools, such as conversational agents (CAs), there is growing interest in supporting developers through natural language interaction. However, little is known about the specific features developers seek in these systems. We conducted a user study with 29 developers using a prototype text-based chatbot to investigate preferred functionalities. Our findings reveal strong interest in task automation, version control support, and contextual adaptability, especially the need to tailor assistance for both novice and experienced users. We highlight the importance of deep contextual understanding, historical interaction awareness, and personalized support in CA design. This study contributes to the development of context-aware chatbots that enhance productivity and satisfaction, and it outlines opportunities for future research on human-AI collaboration in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grouptuner: Efficient Group-Aware Compiler Auto-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08598v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern compilers typically provide hundreds of options to optimize program performance, but users often cannot fully leverage them due to the huge number of options. While standard optimization combinations (e.g., -O3) provide reasonable defaults, they often fail to deliver near-peak performance across diverse programs and architectures. To address this challenge, compiler auto-tuning techniques have emerged to automate the discovery of improved option combinations. Existing techniques typically focus on identifying critical options and prioritizing them during the search to improve efficiency. However, due to limited tuning iterations, the resulting data is often sparse and noisy, making it highly challenging to accurately identify critical options. As a result, these algorithms are prone to being trapped in local optima. To address this limitation, we propose GroupTuner, a group-aware auto-tuning technique that directly applies localized mutation to coherent option groups based on historically best-performing combinations, thus avoiding explicitly identifying critical options. By forgoing the need to know precisely which options are most important, GroupTuner maximizes the use of existing performance data, ensuring more targeted exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTuner can efficiently discover competitive option combinations, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.39% over -O3 while requiring only 77.21% of the time compared to the random search algorithm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in the ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES'25), June 16-17, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea</p></details> |
| **[CursorCore: Assist Programming through Aligning Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07002v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have been successfully applied to programming assistance tasks, such as code completion, code insertion, and instructional code editing. However, these applications remain insufficiently automated and struggle to effectively integrate various types of information during the programming process, including coding history, current code, and user instructions. In this work, we propose a new conversational framework that comprehensively integrates these information sources, collect data to train our models and evaluate their performance. Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well models align with different types of information and the quality of their outputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to comprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance tasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline, Programming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources, such as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically generate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally, using this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and develop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models of comparable size. This framework unifies applications such as inline chat and automated editing, contributes to the advancement of coding assistants.

For instance, hard-coded credentials planted in the code of a file server application would enable maliciously logging into all deployed instances of this application. Confirmed software supply chain attacks have led to the injection of backdoors into popular open-source projects, and backdoors have been discovered in various router firmware. Manual code auditing for backdoors is challenging and existing semi-automated approaches can handle only a limited scope of programs and backdoors, while requiring manual reverse-engineering of the audited (binary) program. Graybox fuzzing (automated semi-randomized testing) has grown in popularity due to its success in discovering vulnerabilities and hence stands as a strong candidate for improved backdoor detection. However, current fuzzing knowledge does not offer any means to detect the triggering of a backdoor at runtime. In this work we introduce ROSA, a novel approach (and tool) which combines a state-of-the-art fuzzer (AFL++) with a new metamorphic test oracle, capable of detecting runtime backdoor triggers. To facilitate the evaluation of ROSA, we have created ROSARUM, the first openly available benchmark for assessing the detection of various backdoors in diverse programs. Experimental evaluation shows that ROSA has a level of robustness, speed and automation similar to classical fuzzing. It finds all 17 authentic or synthetic backdooors from ROSARUM in 1h30 on average. Compared to existing detection tools, it can handle a diversity of backdoors and programs and it does not rely on manual reverse-engineering of the fuzzed binary code.</p></details> |  |

Using digital tools for vocabulary learning can prove beneficial for these children, as they can provide a predictable environment and effective individualized feedback. While existing work has explored the use of technology-assisted vocabulary learning for children with Autism, no study has incorporated turn-taking to facilitate learning and use of vocabulary similar to that used in real-world social contexts. To address this gap, we propose the design of a cooperative two-player vocabulary learning game, CoVoL. CoVoL allows children to engage in game-based vocabulary learning useful for real-world social communication scenarios. We discuss our first prototype and its evaluation. Additionally, we present planned features which are based on feedback obtained through ten interviews with researchers and therapists, as well as an evaluation plan for the final release of CoVoL.</p></details> |  |

HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We began by filtering Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures from the NVD, retaining only those linked to GitHub fix commits. Then we extracted functions and files along with relevant metadata from these commits and used the SZZ algorithm to trace VCCs. To further enhance label reliability, we developed the ESC (Eliminate Suspicious Commit) technique, ensuring credible data labels.

Software developers often leverage both general-purpose and code-specialized LLMs to revise existing code or even generate a whole function from scratch. These capabilities are also beneficial in no-code or low-code contexts, in which one can write programs without a technical background. However, due to their internal design, LLMs are prone to generating hallucinations, which are incorrect, nonsensical, and not justifiable information but difficult to identify its presence. This problem also occurs when generating source code. Once hallucinated code is produced, it is often challenging for users to identify and fix it, especially when such hallucinations can be identified under specific execution paths. As a result, the hallucinated code may remain unnoticed within the codebase. This survey investigates recent studies and techniques relevant to hallucinations generated by CodeLLMs. We categorize the types of hallucinations in the code generated by CodeLLMs, review existing benchmarks and mitigation strategies, and identify open challenges. Based on these findings, this survey outlines further research directions in the detection and removal of hallucinations produced by CodeLLMs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Detecting the Root Cause Code Lines in Bug-Fixing Commits by Heterogeneous Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01022v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous growth in the scale and complexity of software systems, defect remediation has become increasingly difficult and costly. Automated defect prediction tools can proactively identify software changes prone to defects within software projects, thereby enhancing software development efficiency. However, existing work in heterogeneous and complex software projects continues to face challenges, such as struggling with heterogeneous commit structures and ignoring cross-line dependencies in code changes, which ultimately reduce the accuracy of defect identification. To address these challenges, we propose an approach called RC_Detector. RC_Detector comprises three main components: the bug-fixing graph construction component, the code semantic aggregation component, and the cross-line semantic retention component. The bug-fixing graph construction component identifies the code syntax structures and program dependencies within bug-fixing commits and transforms them into heterogeneous graph formats by converting the source code into vector representations. The code semantic aggregation component adapts to heterogeneous data by using heterogeneous attention to learn the hidden semantic representation of target code lines. The cross-line semantic retention component regulates propagated semantic information by using attenuation and reinforcement gates derived from old and new code semantic representations, effectively preserving cross-line semantic relationships. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our model by collecting data from 87 open-source projects, including 675 bug-fixing commits. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements of 83.15%,96.83%,78.71%,74.15%,54.14%,91.66%,91.66%, and 34.82% in MFR, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Constructing test scenarios for autonomous driving systems (ADSs), however, is labor-intensive. We propose TARGET, an end-to-end framework that automatically generates test scenarios from traffic rules. To address complexity, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract knowledge from traffic rules. To mitigate hallucinations caused by large context during input processing, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to be syntactically simple and compositional. This design allows the LLM to learn and generate test scenarios in a modular manner while enabling syntactic and semantic validation for each component. Based on these validated representations, TARGET synthesizes executable scripts to render scenarios in simulation. Evaluated seven ADSs with 284 scenarios derived from 54 traffic rules, TARGET uncovered 610 rule violations, collisions, and other issues. For each violation, TARGET generates scenario recordings and detailed logs, aiding root cause analysis. Two identified issues were confirmed by ADS developers: one linked to an existing bug report and the other to limited ADS functionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Detection of Tangled Code Changes for Higher-Quality Method-Level Bug Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08263v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tangled code changes-commits that conflate unrelated modifications such as bug fixes, refactorings, and enhancements-introduce significant noise into bug datasets and adversely affect the performance of bug prediction models. Addressing this issue at a fine-grained, method-level granularity remains underexplored. This is critical to address, as recent bug prediction models, driven by practitioner demand, are increasingly focusing on finer granularity rather than traditional class- or file-level predictions. This study investigates the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting tangled code changes by leveraging both commit messages and method-level code diffs. We formulate the problem as a binary classification task and evaluate multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, using state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash. Our results demonstrate that combining commit messages with code diffs significantly enhances model performance, with the combined few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting achieving an F1-score of 0.88. Additionally, we explore embedding-based machine learning models trained on LLM-generated embeddings, where a multi-layer perceptron classifier achieves superior performance (F1-score: 0.906, MCC: 0.807). These findings are encouraging for the research community, as method-level bug prediction remains an open research problem, largely due to the lack of noise-free bug datasets. This research not only contributes a novel method-level perspective to the untangling problem but also highlights practical avenues for enhancing automated software quality assessment tools.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines why traditional code plagiarism detection methods frequently fail in these environments and explores the implications of emerging factors such as generative AI (genAI). Drawing on the author's experience teaching a Competitive Programming 1 (CP1) course over seven semesters at Purdue University (with $\approx 100$ students each term) and completely redesigning the CP1/2/3 course sequence, we provide an academically grounded analysis. We review literature on code plagiarism in computer science education, survey current detection tools (Moss, Kattis, etc.) and methods (manual review, code-authorship interviews), and analyze their strengths and limitations. Experience-based observations are presented to illustrate real-world detection failures and successes. We find that widely-used automated similarity checkers can be thwarted by simple code transformations or novel AI-generated code, while human-centric approaches like oral interviews, though effective, are labor-intensive. The paper concludes with opinions and preliminary recommendations for improving academic integrity in programming courses, advocating for a multi-faceted approach that combines improved detection algorithms, mastery-based learning techniques, and authentic assessment practices to better ensure code originality.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |

Due to its importance, there is extensive work on the effectiveness of refactoring in achieving code quality. However, developer's intentions are usually overlooked. A more recent area of study involves the concept of self-affirmed refactoring (SAR), where developers explicitly state their intent to refactor. While studies on SAR have made valuable contributions, they provide little insights into refactoring complexity and effectiveness, as well as the refactorings' relations to specific non-functional requirements. A study by Soares et al. addressed such aspects, but it relied on a quite small sample of studied subject systems and refactoring instances. Following the empirical method of replication, we expanded the scope of Soares et al.'s study by doubling the number of projects analyzed and a significantly larger set of validated refactorings (8,408). Our findings only partially align with the original study. We observed that when developers explicitly state their refactoring intent, the resulting changes typically involve a combination of different refactoring types, making them more complex. Additionally, we confirmed that such complex refactorings positively impact code's internal quality attributes. While refactorings aimed at non-functional requirements tend to improve code quality, our findings only partially align with the original study and contradict it in several ways. Notably, SARs often result in fewer negative impacts on internal quality attributes despite their frequent complexity. These insights suggest the importance of simplifying refactorings where possible and explicitly stating their goals, as clear intent helps shape more effective and targeted refactoring strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Bug-Proneness of Refactored Code: A Longitudinal Multi-Project Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08005v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refactoring is a common practice in software development, aimed at improving the internal code structure in order to make it easier to understand and modify. Consequently, it is often assumed that refactoring makes the code less prone to bugs. However, in practice, refactoring is a complex task and applied in different ways (e.g., various refactoring types, single vs. composite refactorings) and with a variety of purposes (e.g., root-canal vs. floss refactoring). Therefore, certain refactorings can inadvertently make the code more prone to bugs. Unfortunately, there is limited research in the literature on the long-term relationship between the different characteristics of refactorings and bugs. This paper presents a longitudinal study of 12 open source software projects, where 27,450 refactorings, 6,051 reported bugs, and 49,250 bugs detected with static analysis tools were analyzed. While our study confirms the common intuition that refactored code is less bug-prone than non-refactored code, we also extend or contradict existing body of knowledge in other ways. First, a code element that undergoes multiple refactorings is not less bug-prone than an element that undergoes a single refactoring. A single refactoring is the one not performed in conjunction with other refactorings in the same commit. Second, single refactorings often induce the occurrence of bugs across all analyzed projects. Third, code elements affected by refactorings made in conjunction with other non-refactoring changes in the same commit (i.e., floss refactorings) are often bug-prone. Finally, many of such bugs induced by refactoring cannot be revealed with state-of-the-art techniques for detecting behavior-preserving refactorings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Code Generation via Bidirectional Comment-Level Mutual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07768v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation. However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before. Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation. Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis. Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach. Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[The First Prompt Counts the Most! An Evaluation of Large Language Models on Iterative Example-Based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06774v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation have been extensively studied, particularly for implementing target functionalities from natural-language descriptions. Alternatively, input-output (I/O) examples provide an accessible, unambiguous, and flexible way to describe functionalities. However, their inherent diversity, opaqueness, and incompleteness impose greater challenges for understanding and implementing the target requirements. Therefore, generating code from I/O examples (i.e., example-based code generation) provides a new perspective, allowing us to additionally evaluate LLMs' capability to infer target functionalities from limited information and to process new-form requirements. However, related research about LLMs in example-based code generation remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive study on example-based code generation using LLMs. We adopt an iterative evaluation framework and formalize the objective of example-based code generation as two sequential sub-objectives: generating code conforming to the given examples and generating code that successfully implements the target functionalities from (iteratively) given examples. We assess six state-of-the-art LLMs using a new benchmark of 172 diverse target functionalities. The results demonstrate that when requirements are described using iterative I/O examples rather than natural language, the LLMs' score decreases by over 60%, and the vast majority (even over 95%) of successfully implemented functionalities are achieved in the first round of the iterations. Furthermore, we also find that combining I/O examples with even imprecise and fragmental natural language descriptions greatly improves LLM performance, and the selection of initial I/O examples can also influence the score, suggesting opportunities for prompt optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA 2025</p></details> |
| **[PatchTrack: A Comprehensive Analysis of ChatGPT's Influence on Pull Request Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07700v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in software development has introduced new ways for developers to interact with AI, particularly in pull request workflows. While prior research has examined AI-generated code quality, there is limited understanding of how ChatGPT is utilized in real-world pull request decision-making and how its suggestions influence patch integration and rejection. To explore these aspects, we analyze self-admitted ChatGPT usage (SACU), where developers explicitly disclose their reliance on ChatGPT within pull request discussions. Our study examines 338 pull requests (285 merged, 53 closed) across 255 GitHub repositories, containing 645 ChatGPT-generated code snippets and 3,486 patches. We introduce PatchTrack, a classification tool that determines whether ChatGPT-generated patches were applied (PA, 115 cases), not applied (PN, 64 cases), or not suggested (NE, 106 cases). Our findings reveal that full adoption of ChatGPT-generated code is rare, developers frequently modify or selectively integrate AI-generated patches to align with project constraints, with a median integration rate of 25%. Through qualitative analysis, we identify key factors influencing patch integration and pull request rejection, including scope misalignment, maintainability concerns, redundant solutions, and procedural barriers such as incomplete documentation or administrative policies. By providing empirical insights into ChatGPT's role in pull request workflows, this study informs developers, maintainers, and educators on the evolving use of generative AI in collaborative software development. It also lays the groundwork for future research on optimizing AI-assisted development, improving transparency in AI adoption, and enhancing patch integration workflows.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Case Study Investigating the Role of Generative AI in Quality Evaluations of Epics in Agile Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07664v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The broad availability of generative AI offers new opportunities to support various work domains, including agile software development. Agile epics are a key artifact for product managers to communicate requirements to stakeholders. However, in practice, they are often poorly defined, leading to churn, delivery delays, and cost overruns. In this industry case study, we investigate opportunities for large language models (LLMs) to evaluate agile epic quality in a global company. Results from a user study with 17 product managers indicate how LLM evaluations could be integrated into their work practices, including perceived values and usage in improving their epics. High levels of satisfaction indicate that agile epics are a new, viable application of AI evaluations. However, our findings also outline challenges, limitations, and adoption barriers that can inform both practitioners and researchers on the integration of such evaluations into future agile work practices.</p></details> |  |

Specifically by looking at the requirements engineering for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in expert settings. Through a case study at a maritime service provider, we demonstrate how data scientists face a fundamental tension between user expectations of AI perfection and the correctness of the generated outputs. Our findings reveal that data scientists must identify context-specific "retrieval requirements" through iterative experimentation together with users because they are the ones who can determine correctness.

It establishes rules that outline the behaviour of software components and their interfaces and interactions. This modular approach enables the design process to be segmented into smaller, independently developed, tested, and verified system components, ultimately leading to more robust and dependable software. Aim: Despite the significance and well-established theoretical background of CbD, there is a need for a comprehensive systematic mapping study for reliable software systems. Our study provides an evidence-based overview of a method and demonstrates its practical feasibility. Method: To conduct this study, we systematically searched three different databases using specially formulated queries, which initially yielded 1,221 primary studies. After voting, we focused on 288 primary studies for more detailed analysis. Finally, a collaborative review allowed us to gather relevant evidence and information to address our research questions. Results: Our findings suggest potential avenues for future research trajectories in CbD, emphasising its role in improving the dependability of software systems. We highlight maturity levels across different domains and identify areas that may benefit from further research. Conclusion: Although CbD is a well-established software design approach, a more comprehensive literature review is needed to clarify its theoretical state about dependable systems. Our study addresses this gap by providing a detailed overview of CbD from various perspectives, identifying key gaps, and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code. These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We experiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p></details> |  |

Although several studies have explored sampling strategies and machine learning methods to understand and predict the impact of configuration options, the literature still lacks a comprehensive and large-scale dataset encompassing multiple kernel versions along with detailed quantitative measurements. To bridge this gap, we introduce LinuxData, an accessible collection of kernel configurations spanning several kernel releases, specifically from versions 4.13 to 5.8. This dataset, gathered through automated tools and build processes, comprises over 240,000 kernel configurations systematically labeled with compilation outcomes and binary sizes. By providing detailed records of configuration evolution and capturing the intricate interplay among kernel options, our dataset enables innovative research in feature subset selection, prediction models based on machine learning, and transfer learning across kernel versions. Throughout this paper, we describe how the dataset has been made easily accessible via OpenML and illustrate how it can be leveraged using only a few lines of Python code to evaluate AI-based techniques, such as supervised machine learning. We anticipate that this dataset will significantly enhance reproducibility and foster new insights into configuration-space analysis at a scale that presents unique opportunities and inherent challenges, thereby advancing our understanding of the Linux kernel's configurability and evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-assisted Mutation for Whitebox API Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05738v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud applications heavily rely on APIs to communicate with each other and exchange data. To ensure the reliability of cloud applications, cloud providers widely adopt API testing techniques. Unfortunately, existing API testing approaches are insufficient to reach strict conditions, a problem known as fitness plateaus, due to the lack of gradient provided by coverage metrics. To address this issue, we propose MioHint, a novel white-box API testing approach that leverages the code comprehension capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) to boost API testing. The key challenge of LLM-based API testing lies in system-level testing, which emphasizes the dependencies between requests and targets across functions and files, thereby making the entire codebase the object of analysis. However, feeding the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical due to its limited context length and short memory. MioHint addresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs. We retrieve relevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including def-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for subfunctions called by the target. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across 16 real-world REST API services. The findings reveal that MioHint achieves an average increase of 4.95% absolute in line coverage compared to the baseline, EvoMaster, alongside a remarkable factor of 67x improvement in mutation accuracy. Furthermore, our method successfully covers over 57% of hard-to-cover targets while in baseline the coverage is less than 10%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review on Neural Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07425v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation aims to convert code from one programming language to another automatically. It is motivated by the need for multi-language software development and legacy system migration. In recent years, neural code translation has gained significant attention, driven by rapid advancements in deep learning and large language models. Researchers have proposed various techniques to improve neural code translation quality. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive systematic literature review has been conducted to summarize the key techniques and challenges in this field. To fill this research gap, we collected 57 primary studies covering the period 2020~2025 on neural code translation. These studies are analyzed from seven key perspectives: task characteristics, data preprocessing, code modeling, model construction, post-processing, evaluation subjects, and evaluation metrics. Our analysis reveals current research trends, identifies unresolved challenges, and shows potential directions for future work. These findings can provide valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the field of neural code translation.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[A Preliminary Study of Large Language Models for Multilingual Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07376v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based approaches, particularly those leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs), have shown promise in automated software vulnerability detection. However, existing methods are predominantly limited to specific programming languages, restricting their applicability in multilingual settings. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities and enhanced semantic understanding, presenting a potential solution to this limitation. While existing studies have explored LLMs for vulnerability detection, their detection performance remains unknown for multilingual vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conducted a preliminary study to evaluate the effectiveness of PLMs and state-of-the-art LLMs across seven popular programming languages. Our findings reveal that the PLM CodeT5P achieves the best performance in multilingual vulnerability detection, particularly in identifying the most critical vulnerabilities. Based on these results, we further discuss the potential of LLMs in advancing real-world multilingual vulnerability detection. This work represents an initial step toward exploring PLMs and LLMs for cross-language vulnerability detection, offering key insights for future research and practical deployment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Synthetic Code Surgery: Repairing Bugs and Vulnerabilities with LLMs and Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07372v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel methodology for enhancing Automated Program Repair (APR) through synthetic data generation utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of high-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple programming languages. The proposed approach addresses this limitation through a two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous quality assessment. Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate approximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12 programming languages and 13 bug categories. Subsequently, these samples underwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code quality, security, performance, and completeness. Experimental evaluation on the VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in Perfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset outperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in certain scenarios. The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical testing, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference analysis. Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing systems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy. This research establishes a self-bootstrapping paradigm in which LLMs generate and evaluate their own training data, potentially transforming approaches to data scarcity across software engineering tasks and advancing the development of robust, adaptable tools for automated code maintenance.</p></details> |  |

As large language models (LLMs) continue to excel in diverse language understanding and generation tasks, their potential in decoding complex binary data structures becomes evident. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks in this domain limits the assessment and comparison of LLM's capabilities in binary analysis and hinders the progress of research and practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce BinMetric, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the performance of large language models on binary analysis tasks. BinMetric comprises 1,000 questions derived from 20 real-world open-source projects across 6 practical binary analysis tasks, including decompilation, code summarization, assembly instruction generation, etc., which reflect actual reverse engineering scenarios. Our empirical study on this benchmark investigates the binary analysis capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing their strengths and limitations in this field. The findings indicate that while LLMs show strong potential, challenges still exist, particularly in the areas of precise binary lifting and assembly synthesis. In summary, BinMetric makes a significant step forward in measuring the binary analysis capabilities of LLMs, establishing a new benchmark leaderboard, and our study provides valuable insights for the future development of these LLMs in software security.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Automated Repair of Ambiguous Natural Language Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07270v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has amplified the role of natural language (NL) in software engineering, and its inherent ambiguity and susceptibility to misinterpretation pose a fundamental challenge for software quality, because employing ambiguous requirements may result in the generation of faulty programs. The complexity of ambiguity detection and resolution motivates us to introduce the problem of automated repair of ambiguous NL requirements. Repairing ambiguity in requirements poses a challenge for LLMs, as it demands a metacognitive capability - the ability to reflect on how alterations to the text influence their own interpretation of this text. Indeed, our experiments show that directly prompting an LLM to detect and resolve ambiguities results in irrelevant or inconsistent clarifications. Our key novelty is in decomposing this problem into simpler subproblems which do not require metacognitive reasoning. First, we analyze and repair LLM's interpretation of requirements embodied in the distribution of programs they induce using traditional testing and program repair methods. Second, we repair requirements based on the changes to the distribution via what we refer to as contractive specification inference. This decomposition enables targeted, minimal requirement repairs that yield cross-model performance gains in code generation. We implemented this approach in a tool SpecFix, and evaluated it using three SOTA LLMs, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen2.5-Coder-32b-Instruct, across two widely-used code generation benchmarks: HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Our results show that SpecFix, operating autonomously without human intervention or external information, outputs repaired requirements that, when used by LLMs for code generation, increase the Pass@1 score by 4.3%, and help LLMs to solve 3.4% more problems via majority vote.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Black-box Testing Framework for Oracle Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07243v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oracle quantum programs are a fundamental class of quantum programs that serve as a critical bridge between quantum computing and classical computing. Many important quantum algorithms are built upon oracle quantum programs, making it essential to ensure their correctness during development. While software testing is a well-established approach for improving program reliability, no systematic method has been developed to test oracle quantum programs. This paper proposes a black-box testing framework designed for general oracle quantum programs. We define these programs formally, establish the foundational theory for their testing, and propose a detailed testing framework. We develop a prototype tool and conduct extensive experimental evaluations to evaluate the framework's effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly aids developers in testing oracle quantum programs, providing insights to enhance the reliability of quantum software.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |

We investigate mems, the number of memory accesses, as a static and architecture-independent performance metric. We develop a Clang-based automated instrumentation tool that rewrites source code to insert path tracing and \textit{mems} counting logic. This allows us to evaluate mems-based performance estimation across ten classical algorithm programs. Experimental results show that within the same program, execution paths with higher mems values consistently exhibit longer runtime. However, this correlation weakens between different programs, suggesting that mems is best suited for comparing performance of different execution paths in a program.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffGAN: A Test Generation Approach for Differential Testing of Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19794v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across applications. However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.</p></details> |  |

The expansion of the field of study called ``algorithmic justice'' fundamentally consists in the creation of mechanisms and procedures based on mathematical and formal procedures to conceptualize, evaluate and reduce biases and discrimination caused by algorithms. We conducted a systematic mapping in the context of justice in software engineering, comprising the metrics and definitions of algorithmic justice, as well as the procedures and techniques for fairer decision-making systems. We propose a discussion about the limitations that arise due to the understanding of justice as an attribute of software and the result of decision-making, as well as the influence that the field suffers from the construction of computational thinking, which is constantly developed around abstractions. Finally, we reflect on potential paths that could help us move beyond the limits of algorithmic justice.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Po...</summary><p>in Portuguese language</p></details> |
| **[On the Impact of Black-box Deployment Strategies for Edge AI on Latency and Model Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17154v3)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deciding what combination of operators to use across the Edge AI tiers to achieve specific latency and model performance requirements is an open question for MLOps engineers. This study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs inference time trade-off of different black-box Edge AI deployment strategies, i.e., combinations of deployment operators and deployment tiers. In this paper, we conduct inference experiments involving 3 deployment operators (i.e., Partitioning, Quantization, Early Exit), 3 deployment tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) and their combinations on four widely used Computer-Vision models to investigate the optimal strategies from the point of view of MLOps developers. Our findings suggest that Edge deployment using the hybrid Quantization + Early Exit operator could be preferred over non-hybrid operators (Quantization/Early Exit on Edge, Partition on Mobile-Edge) when faster latency is a concern at medium accuracy loss. However, when minimizing accuracy loss is a concern, MLOps engineers should prefer using only a Quantization operator on edge at a latency reduction or increase, respectively over the Early Exit/Partition (on edge/mobile-edge) and Quantized Early Exit (on edge) operators. In scenarios constrained by Mobile CPU/RAM resources, a preference for Partitioning across mobile and edge tiers is observed over mobile deployment. For models with smaller input data samples (such as FCN), a network-constrained cloud deployment can also be a better alternative than Mobile/Edge deployment and Partitioning strategies. For models with large input data samples (ResNet, ResNext, DUC), an edge tier having higher network/computational capabilities than Cloud/Mobile can be a more viable option than Partitioning and Mobile/Cloud deployment strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, complex AI models, which make decisions without providing clear explanations (known as the "black-box problem"), currently restrict trust and widespread adoption of AI. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged to address the black-box problem of making AI systems more interpretable and transparent so stakeholders can trust, verify, and act upon AI-based outcomes. Researchers have developed various techniques to foster XAI in the Software Development Lifecycle. However, there are gaps in applying XAI techniques in the Software Engineering phases. Literature review shows that 68% of XAI in Software Engineering research is focused on maintenance as opposed to 8% on software management and requirements. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the applications of XAI methods such as concept-based explanations, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), rule extraction, attention mechanisms, counterfactual explanations, and example-based explanations to the different phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including requirements elicitation, design and development, testing and deployment, and evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of XAI techniques for every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This survey aims to promote explainable AI in Software Engineering and facilitate the practical application of complex AI models in AI-driven software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE COMPSAC 2025</p></details> |

However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 16 figures, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (2025)</p></details> |

| **[Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful for Java Function Bug Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10375v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, managing the configuration differences between these two environments can be challenging, leading to inconsistent behavior, unexpected errors, and increased downtime. Objective: In this study, we sought to investigate the strategies software companies employ to mitigate the configuration differences between the development and production environments. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these strategies used to contribute to reducing the risk of configuration-related issues. Method: To achieve this goal, we interviewed 17 participants and leveraged the Thematic Analysis methodology to analyze the interview data. These participants shed some light on the current practices, processes, challenges, or issues they have encountered. Results: Based on the interviews, we systematically formulated and structured a catalog of eight strategies that explain how software producing companies mitigate these configuration differences. These strategies vary from 1) creating detailed configuration management plans, 2) using automation tools, and 3) developing processes to test and validate changes through containers and virtualization technologies. Conclusion: By implementing these strategies, companies can improve their ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the production environment. In addition, they can also ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Bisimulation for Parameterized Anonymity and Uniformity Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09963v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bisimulation is crucial for verifying process equivalence in probabilistic systems. This paper presents a novel logical framework for analyzing bisimulation in probabilistic parameterized systems, namely, infinite families of finite-state probabilistic systems. Our framework is built upon the first-order theory of regular structures, which provides a decidable logic for reasoning about these systems. We show that essential properties like anonymity and uniformity can be encoded and verified within this framework in a manner aligning with the principles of deductive software verification, where systems, properties, and proofs are expressed in a unified decidable logic. By integrating language inference techniques, we achieve full automation in synthesizing candidate bisimulation proofs for anonymity and uniformity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by addressing several challenging examples, including cryptographic protocols and randomized algorithms that were previously beyond the reach of fully automated methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UICopilot: Automating UI Synthesis via Hierarchical Code Generation from Webpage Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09904v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating the synthesis of User Interfaces (UIs) plays a crucial role in enhancing productivity and accelerating the development lifecycle, reducing both development time and manual effort. Recently, the rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made it possible to generate front-end Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code directly from webpage designs. However, real-world webpages encompass not only a diverse array of HTML tags but also complex stylesheets, resulting in significantly lengthy code. The lengthy code poses challenges for the performance and efficiency of MLLMs, especially in capturing the structural information of UI designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes UICopilot, a novel approach to automating UI synthesis via hierarchical code generation from webpage designs. The core idea of UICopilot is to decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating the coarse-grained HTML hierarchical structure, followed by the generation of fine-grained code. To validate the effectiveness of UICopilot, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, i.e., WebCode2M. Experimental results demonstrate that UICopilot significantly outperforms existing baselines in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, statistical analysis reveals that the majority of human annotators prefer the webpages generated by UICopilot over those produced by GPT-4V.</p></details> | WWW' 2025 |

Developers work tirelessly to ensure that their applications are both functional and user-friendly. In pursuit of this, Automated Input Generation (AIG) tools have emerged as a promising solution for testing mobile applications by simulating user interactions and exploring app functionalities. However, these tools face significant challenges in navigating complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), and developers often have trouble understanding their output. More specifically, AIG tools face difficulties in navigating out of certain screens, such as login pages and advertisements, due to a lack of contextual understanding which leads to suboptimal testing coverage. Furthermore, while AIG tools can provide interaction traces consisting of action and screen details, there is limited understanding of its coverage of higher level functionalities, such as logging in, setting alarms, or saving notes. Understanding these covered use cases are essential to ensure comprehensive test coverage of app functionalities. Difficulty in testing mobile UIs can lead to the design of complex interfaces, which can adversely affect users of advanced age who often face usability barriers due to small buttons, cluttered layouts, and unintuitive navigation. There exists many studies that highlight these issues, but automated solutions for improving UI accessibility needs more attention. This research seeks to enhance automated UI testing techniques by learning the screen usage semantics of mobile apps and helping them navigate more efficiently, offer more insights about tested functionalities and also improve the usability of a mobile app's interface by identifying and mitigating UI design issues.</p></details> |  |

It complements previous theoretical work published by existing developers of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) on the overall engineering practices and methodologies for readiness determination. Readiness determination is, at its core, a risk assessment process. It is aimed at evaluating the residual risk associated with the deployment of a new software release candidate. The paper proposes methodological criteria to ground the readiness review process for an ADS release. While informed by Waymo's experience in this domain, the criteria presented are agnostic of any specific ADS technological solution and/or architectural choice, to support broad implementation by others in the industry. The paper continues with a discussion on governance and decision-making toward approval of a new software release candidate for the ADS. The implementation of the presented criteria requires the existence of appropriate safety management practices in addition to many other cultural, procedural, and operational considerations. As such, the paper is concluded by a statement of limitations for those wishing to replicate part or all of its content.</p></details> |  |

This research evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automatically generating test cases, comparing them with manual tests. An optimized prompt was developed, that integrates code and requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements. Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This work highlights the importance of manual qualitative analysis as an essential complement to automation in unit test evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision at Jornadas de Cloud Computing, Big Data & Emerging Topics (JCC-BD&ET) - 2025</p></details> |

This approach is particularly valuable for scientific computing applications in which comprehensive tests are needed to prevent flawed results or conclusions. As scientific discovery becomes increasingly more complex, domain scientists couple multiple scientific computing models or simulations to solve intricate multiphysics and multiscale problems. These model-coupling applications use a hardwired coupling program or a flexible web service to link and combine different models. In this paper, we focus on the quality assurance of the more elastic web service via a combination of rigorous specification and testing methods. The application of statistical testing exposes problems ignored by pre-written unit tests and highlights areas in the code where failures might occur. We certify the model-coupling server controller with a derived reliability statistic, offering a quantitative measure to support a claim of its robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to SEKE2025</p></details> |

There has been considerable discussion about the use of LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language, but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design, and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.</p></details> |  |

We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching 'Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated 'just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

However, existing methods often focus on generating a single high-quality summary for a given source code, neglecting scenarios where the generated summary might be inadequate and alternative options are needed. In this paper, we introduce Variational Prefix Tuning (VPT), a novel approach that enhances pre-trained models' ability to generate diverse yet accurate sets of summaries, allowing the user to choose the most suitable one for the given source code. Our method integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework as a modular component into pre-trained models, enabling us to model the distribution of observed target summaries and sample continuous embeddings to be used as prefixes to steer the generation of diverse outputs during decoding. Importantly, we construct our method in a parameter-efficient manner, eliminating the need for expensive model retraining, especially when using LLMCs. Furthermore, we employ a bi-criteria reranking method to select a subset of generated summaries, optimizing both the diversity and the accuracy of the options presented to users. We present extensive experimental evaluations using widely used datasets and current state-of-the-art pre-trained code summarization models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its adaptability across models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/SceneGenAgent .</p></details> |  |

| **[Are Large Language Models Robust in Understanding Code Against Semantics-Preserving Mutations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10443v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Repetition Problems of LLMs in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10402v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |
| **[Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful for Java Function Bug Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10375v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Objective: Despite the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in various software engineering tasks, their effectiveness in SVA remains underexplored. Method: To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach SVA-ICL, which leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM performance. Our approach involves the selection of high-quality demonstrations for ICL through information fusion, incorporating both source code and vulnerability descriptions. For source code, we consider semantic, lexical, and syntactic similarities, while for vulnerability descriptions, we focus on textual similarity. Based on the selected demonstrations, we construct context prompts and consider DeepSeek-V2 as the LLM for SVA-ICL. Results: We evaluate the effectiveness of SVA-ICL using a large-scale dataset comprising 12,071 C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SVA-ICL outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC measures. Furthermore, ablation studies highlight the significance of component customization in SVA-ICL, such as the number of demonstrations, the demonstration ordering strategy, and the optimal fusion ratio of different modalities. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that leveraging ICL with information fusion can effectively improve the effectiveness of LLM-based SVA, warranting further research in this direction.</p></details> |  |

This research evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automatically generating test cases, comparing them with manual tests. An optimized prompt was developed, that integrates code and requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements. Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This work highlights the importance of manual qualitative analysis as an essential complement to automation in unit test evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision at Jornadas de Cloud Computing, Big Data & Emerging Topics (JCC-BD&ET) - 2025</p></details> |
| **[Customizing a Large Language Model for VHDL Design of High-Performance Microprocessors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09610v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hardware design has taken off in recent years, principally through its incorporation in tools that increase chip designer productivity. There has been considerable discussion about the use of LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language, but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design, and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.</p></details> |  |

Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on problem-solving and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MIGRATION-BENCH with a distinct focus: code migration. MIGRATION-BENCH aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java 8 to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java 17, 21), MIGRATION-BENCH includes a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java 17. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves 62.33% and 27.00% success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience and https://github.com/amazon-science/self_debug respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 16 figures, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (2025)</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o.

Although many tools generate UML diagrams from UML code, generating executable UML code from image-based UML diagrams remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach to generate UML code using a large multimodal language model automatically. Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models. The experiments measured code generation accuracy across different model sizes and training strategies. These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams. This will enable the modernization of legacy systems and decrease the manual effort in software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Journal of Machine Learning with Applications, Author Contributions: Averi Bates: Methodology, Development, Analysis, Data Curation, Drafting, Review.

While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, managing the configuration differences between these two environments can be challenging, leading to inconsistent behavior, unexpected errors, and increased downtime. Objective: In this study, we sought to investigate the strategies software companies employ to mitigate the configuration differences between the development and production environments. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these strategies used to contribute to reducing the risk of configuration-related issues. Method: To achieve this goal, we interviewed 17 participants and leveraged the Thematic Analysis methodology to analyze the interview data. These participants shed some light on the current practices, processes, challenges, or issues they have encountered. Results: Based on the interviews, we systematically formulated and structured a catalog of eight strategies that explain how software producing companies mitigate these configuration differences. These strategies vary from 1) creating detailed configuration management plans, 2) using automation tools, and 3) developing processes to test and validate changes through containers and virtualization technologies. Conclusion: By implementing these strategies, companies can improve their ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the production environment. In addition, they can also ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on the environmental craze on social media platforms and its impact on young activists aged 16-25. With the advancement of social media, new avenues have opened for participation in sustainability issues, especially for the marginalized, as information moved through transnational networks at lightning speed. Along with specific Formative Visual Storytelling methods, the young leaders of the movement deploy hashtags and other online tools to capture the attention of their peers and decision makers. Challenges persist with "clicktivism" fatigue from the internet, and site limitations.

| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Drawing from an Action Research case study at a global Swedish enterprise, we identify and address critical barriers such as departmental fragmentation, regulatory constraints, and organizational inertia that can impede successful AI transformation. X-FAIT employs force field analysis, executive sponsorship, cross-functional integration, and systematic risk assessment strategies to coordinate efforts across organizational boundaries, facilitating knowledge sharing and ensuring AI initiatives align with objectives. The framework provides both theoretical insights into AI-driven organizational transformation and practical guidance for software organizations aiming to effectively integrate AI into their daily workflows and, longer-term, products.</p></details> | 4 pages |

This has thus caused a spotlight to be paced on these resources, where researchers have reported mixed outcomes around the quality of these resources. Stack Overflow, in particular, has been studied extensively, with evidence showing that code resources on this platform can be of poor quality at times. Limited research has explored the variables or factors that predict code quality on Stack Overflow, but instead has focused on ranking content, identifying defects and predicting future content. In many instances approaches used for prediction are not evaluated to identify the best techniques. Contextualizing the Stack Overflow code quality problem as regression-based, we examined the variables that predict Stack Overflow (Java) code quality, and the regression approach that provides the best predictive power. Six approaches were considered in our evaluation, where Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) stood out. In addition, longer Stack Overflow code tended to have more code violations, questions that were scored higher also attracted more views and the more answers that are added to questions on Stack Overflow the more errors were typically observed in the code that was provided. Outcomes here point to the value of the GBM ensemble learning mechanism, and the need for the practitioner community to be prudent when contributing and reusing Stack Overflow Java coding resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Objective: Despite the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in various software engineering tasks, their effectiveness in SVA remains underexplored. Method: To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach SVA-ICL, which leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM performance. Our approach involves the selection of high-quality demonstrations for ICL through information fusion, incorporating both source code and vulnerability descriptions. For source code, we consider semantic, lexical, and syntactic similarities, while for vulnerability descriptions, we focus on textual similarity. Based on the selected demonstrations, we construct context prompts and consider DeepSeek-V2 as the LLM for SVA-ICL. Results: We evaluate the effectiveness of SVA-ICL using a large-scale dataset comprising 12,071 C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SVA-ICL outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC measures. Furthermore, ablation studies highlight the significance of component customization in SVA-ICL, such as the number of demonstrations, the demonstration ordering strategy, and the optimal fusion ratio of different modalities. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that leveraging ICL with information fusion can effectively improve the effectiveness of LLM-based SVA, warranting further research in this direction.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, user models do not seem to be part of standard modeling languages nor common in current model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to analyze existing proposals for user modeling in MDE and identify their limitations. The results showcase that there is a lack of a unified and complete user modeling perspective. Instead, we observe a lot of fragmented and partial proposals considering only simple user dimensions and with lack of proper tool support. This limits the implementation of richer user interfaces able to better support the user-specific needs. Therefore, we hope this analysis triggers a discussion on the importance of user models and their inclusion in MDE pipelines. Especially in a context where, thanks to the rise of AI techniques, personalization, based on a rich number of user dimensions, is becoming more and more of a possibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Bisimulation for Parameterized Anonymity and Uniformity Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09963v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bisimulation is crucial for verifying process equivalence in probabilistic systems. This paper presents a novel logical framework for analyzing bisimulation in probabilistic parameterized systems, namely, infinite families of finite-state probabilistic systems. Our framework is built upon the first-order theory of regular structures, which provides a decidable logic for reasoning about these systems. We show that essential properties like anonymity and uniformity can be encoded and verified within this framework in a manner aligning with the principles of deductive software verification, where systems, properties, and proofs are expressed in a unified decidable logic. By integrating language inference techniques, we achieve full automation in synthesizing candidate bisimulation proofs for anonymity and uniformity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by addressing several challenging examples, including cryptographic protocols and randomized algorithms that were previously beyond the reach of fully automated methods.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made it possible to generate front-end Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code directly from webpage designs. However, real-world webpages encompass not only a diverse array of HTML tags but also complex stylesheets, resulting in significantly lengthy code. The lengthy code poses challenges for the performance and efficiency of MLLMs, especially in capturing the structural information of UI designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes UICopilot, a novel approach to automating UI synthesis via hierarchical code generation from webpage designs. The core idea of UICopilot is to decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating the coarse-grained HTML hierarchical structure, followed by the generation of fine-grained code. To validate the effectiveness of UICopilot, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, i.e., WebCode2M. Experimental results demonstrate that UICopilot significantly outperforms existing baselines in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, statistical analysis reveals that the majority of human annotators prefer the webpages generated by UICopilot over those produced by GPT-4V.</p></details> | WWW' 2025 |
| **[Advancing Mobile UI Testing by Learning Screen Usage Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09894v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for quality in mobile applications has increased greatly given users' high reliance on them for daily tasks. Developers work tirelessly to ensure that their applications are both functional and user-friendly. In pursuit of this, Automated Input Generation (AIG) tools have emerged as a promising solution for testing mobile applications by simulating user interactions and exploring app functionalities. However, these tools face significant challenges in navigating complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), and developers often have trouble understanding their output. More specifically, AIG tools face difficulties in navigating out of certain screens, such as login pages and advertisements, due to a lack of contextual understanding which leads to suboptimal testing coverage. Furthermore, while AIG tools can provide interaction traces consisting of action and screen details, there is limited understanding of its coverage of higher level functionalities, such as logging in, setting alarms, or saving notes. Understanding these covered use cases are essential to ensure comprehensive test coverage of app functionalities. Difficulty in testing mobile UIs can lead to the design of complex interfaces, which can adversely affect users of advanced age who often face usability barriers due to small buttons, cluttered layouts, and unintuitive navigation. There exists many studies that highlight these issues, but automated solutions for improving UI accessibility needs more attention. This research seeks to enhance automated UI testing techniques by learning the screen usage semantics of mobile apps and helping them navigate more efficiently, offer more insights about tested functionalities and also improve the usability of a mobile app's interface by identifying and mitigating UI design issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Determining Absence of Unreasonable Risk: Approval Guidelines for an Automated Driving System Release](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09880v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides an overview of how the determination of absence of unreasonable risk can be operationalized. It complements previous theoretical work published by existing developers of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) on the overall engineering practices and methodologies for readiness determination. Readiness determination is, at its core, a risk assessment process. It is aimed at evaluating the residual risk associated with the deployment of a new software release candidate. The paper proposes methodological criteria to ground the readiness review process for an ADS release. While informed by Waymo's experience in this domain, the criteria presented are agnostic of any specific ADS technological solution and/or architectural choice, to support broad implementation by others in the industry. The paper continues with a discussion on governance and decision-making toward approval of a new software release candidate for the ADS. The implementation of the presented criteria requires the existence of appropriate safety management practices in addition to many other cultural, procedural, and operational considerations. As such, the paper is concluded by a statement of limitations for those wishing to replicate part or all of its content.</p></details> |  |

This research evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automatically generating test cases, comparing them with manual tests. An optimized prompt was developed, that integrates code and requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements. Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This work highlights the importance of manual qualitative analysis as an essential complement to automation in unit test evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision at Jornadas de Cloud Computing, Big Data & Emerging Topics (JCC-BD&ET) - 2025</p></details> |

This is especially true for foundation libraries, which are used by the software packages visible to the users, being ``hidden'' themselves. The funders and other organizations need to understand the complex network of computer programs that the modern research relies upon. In this work we used CZ Software Mentions Dataset to map the dependencies of the software used in biomedical papers and find the packages critical to the software ecosystems. We propose the centrality metrics for the network of software dependencies, analyze three ecosystems (PyPi, CRAN, Bioconductor) and determine the packages with the highest centrality.</p></details> |  |

Scalability challenges, increasing demand, and ongoing code changes can contribute to such failures. As software architectures evolve rapidly, understanding how and why incidents occur is crucial for enhancing system reliability. In this study, we introduce Carbon Health's software stack, share our microservices journey, and analyze 107 incidents. Based on these incidents, we share insights and lessons learned on microservice decomposition. Finally, we suggest that starting with monolithic modularization as an initial step toward microservice decomposition may help reduce incidents and contribute to building more resilient software.</p></details> | EASE 2025 |

In response, researchers and practitioners have developed tools to detect and reduce undesired bias, commonly referred to as fairness tools. Many of these tools are publicly available for free use and adaptation. While the growing availability of such tools is promising, little is known about the broader landscape beyond well-known examples like AI Fairness 360 and Fairlearn. Because fairness is an ongoing concern, these tools must be built for long-term sustainability. Using an existing set of fairness tools as a reference, we systematically searched GitHub and identified 50 related projects. We then analyzed various aspects of their repositories to assess community engagement and the extent of ongoing maintenance. Our findings show diverse forms of engagement with these tools, suggesting strong support for open-source development. However, we also found significant variation in how well these tools are maintained. Notably, 53 percent of fairness projects become inactive within the first three years. By examining sustainability in fairness tooling, we aim to promote more stability and growth in this critical area.</p></details> |  |

This approach is particularly valuable for scientific computing applications in which comprehensive tests are needed to prevent flawed results or conclusions. As scientific discovery becomes increasingly more complex, domain scientists couple multiple scientific computing models or simulations to solve intricate multiphysics and multiscale problems. These model-coupling applications use a hardwired coupling program or a flexible web service to link and combine different models. In this paper, we focus on the quality assurance of the more elastic web service via a combination of rigorous specification and testing methods. The application of statistical testing exposes problems ignored by pre-written unit tests and highlights areas in the code where failures might occur. We certify the model-coupling server controller with a derived reliability statistic, offering a quantitative measure to support a claim of its robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to SEKE2025</p></details> |
| **[Customizing a Large Language Model for VHDL Design of High-Performance Microprocessors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09610v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hardware design has taken off in recent years, principally through its incorporation in tools that increase chip designer productivity. There has been considerable discussion about the use of LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language, but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design, and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.</p></details> |  |

Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on problem-solving and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MIGRATION-BENCH with a distinct focus: code migration. MIGRATION-BENCH aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java 8 to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java 17, 21), MIGRATION-BENCH includes a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java 17. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves 62.33% and 27.00% success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience and https://github.com/amazon-science/self_debug respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, DL systems are prone to bugs from many sources, including training data. Existing literature suggests that bugs in training data are highly prevalent, but little research has focused on understanding their impacts on the models used in software engineering tasks. In this paper, we address this research gap through a comprehensive empirical investigation focused on three types of data prevalent in software engineering tasks: code-based, text-based, and metric-based. Using state-of-the-art baselines, we compare the models trained on clean datasets with those trained on datasets with quality issues and without proper preprocessing. By analysing the gradients, weights, and biases from neural networks under training, we identify the symptoms of data quality and preprocessing issues. Our analysis reveals that quality issues in code data cause biased learning and gradient instability, whereas problems in text data lead to overfitting and poor generalisation of models. On the other hand, quality issues in metric data result in exploding gradients and model overfitting, and inadequate preprocessing exacerbates these effects across all three data types. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and generalizability of our findings using six new datasets. Our research provides a better understanding of the impact and symptoms of data bugs in software engineering datasets. Practitioners and researchers can leverage these findings to develop better monitoring systems and data-cleaning methods to help detect and resolve data bugs in deep learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Major Revision at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |

We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching 'Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated 'just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

For Machine Learning (ML) systems, bloat is a major contributor to their technical debt leading to decreased performance and resource wastage. In this work, we present, Negativa-ML, a novel tool to identify and remove bloat in ML frameworks by analyzing their shared libraries. Our approach includes novel techniques to detect and locate unnecessary code within device code - a key area overlooked by existing research, which focuses primarily on host code. We evaluate Negativa-ML using four popular ML frameworks across ten workloads over 300 shared libraries. The results demonstrate that the ML frameworks are highly bloated on both the device and host code side. On average, Negativa-ML reduces the device code size in these frameworks by up to 75% and the host code by up to 72%, resulting in total file size reductions of up to 55%. The device code is a primary source of bloat within ML frameworks. Through debloating, we achieve reductions in peak host memory usage, peak GPU memory usage, and execution time by up to 74.6%, 69.6%, and 44.6%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o.

Although many tools generate UML diagrams from UML code, generating executable UML code from image-based UML diagrams remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach to generate UML code using a large multimodal language model automatically. Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models.

While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |
| **[Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful for Java Function Bug Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10375v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

This has thus caused a spotlight to be paced on these resources, where researchers have reported mixed outcomes around the quality of these resources. Stack Overflow, in particular, has been studied extensively, with evidence showing that code resources on this platform can be of poor quality at times. Limited research has explored the variables or factors that predict code quality on Stack Overflow, but instead has focused on ranking content, identifying defects and predicting future content. In many instances approaches used for prediction are not evaluated to identify the best techniques. Contextualizing the Stack Overflow code quality problem as regression-based, we examined the variables that predict Stack Overflow (Java) code quality, and the regression approach that provides the best predictive power. Six approaches were considered in our evaluation, where Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) stood out. In addition, longer Stack Overflow code tended to have more code violations, questions that were scored higher also attracted more views and the more answers that are added to questions on Stack Overflow the more errors were typically observed in the code that was provided. Outcomes here point to the value of the GBM ensemble learning mechanism, and the need for the practitioner community to be prudent when contributing and reusing Stack Overflow Java coding resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Objective: Despite the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in various software engineering tasks, their effectiveness in SVA remains underexplored. Method: To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach SVA-ICL, which leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM performance. Our approach involves the selection of high-quality demonstrations for ICL through information fusion, incorporating both source code and vulnerability descriptions. For source code, we consider semantic, lexical, and syntactic similarities, while for vulnerability descriptions, we focus on textual similarity. Based on the selected demonstrations, we construct context prompts and consider DeepSeek-V2 as the LLM for SVA-ICL. Results: We evaluate the effectiveness of SVA-ICL using a large-scale dataset comprising 12,071 C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SVA-ICL outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC measures. Furthermore, ablation studies highlight the significance of component customization in SVA-ICL, such as the number of demonstrations, the demonstration ordering strategy, and the optimal fusion ratio of different modalities. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that leveraging ICL with information fusion can effectively improve the effectiveness of LLM-based SVA, warranting further research in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[User Modeling in Model-Driven Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15871v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In software applications, user models can be used to specify the profile of the typical users of the application, including personality traits, preferences, skills, etc. In theory, this would enable an adaptive application behavior that could lead to a better user experience. Nevertheless, user models do not seem to be part of standard modeling languages nor common in current model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to analyze existing proposals for user modeling in MDE and identify their limitations. The results showcase that there is a lack of a unified and complete user modeling perspective. Instead, we observe a lot of fragmented and partial proposals considering only simple user dimensions and with lack of proper tool support. This limits the implementation of richer user interfaces able to better support the user-specific needs. Therefore, we hope this analysis triggers a discussion on the importance of user models and their inclusion in MDE pipelines. Especially in a context where, thanks to the rise of AI techniques, personalization, based on a rich number of user dimensions, is becoming more and more of a possibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[UICopilot: Automating UI Synthesis via Hierarchical Code Generation from Webpage Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09904v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating the synthesis of User Interfaces (UIs) plays a crucial role in enhancing productivity and accelerating the development lifecycle, reducing both development time and manual effort. Recently, the rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made it possible to generate front-end Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code directly from webpage designs. However, real-world webpages encompass not only a diverse array of HTML tags but also complex stylesheets, resulting in significantly lengthy code. The lengthy code poses challenges for the performance and efficiency of MLLMs, especially in capturing the structural information of UI designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes UICopilot, a novel approach to automating UI synthesis via hierarchical code generation from webpage designs. The core idea of UICopilot is to decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating the coarse-grained HTML hierarchical structure, followed by the generation of fine-grained code. To validate the effectiveness of UICopilot, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, i.e., WebCode2M. Experimental results demonstrate that UICopilot significantly outperforms existing baselines in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, statistical analysis reveals that the majority of human annotators prefer the webpages generated by UICopilot over those produced by GPT-4V.</p></details> | WWW' 2025 |

This research evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automatically generating test cases, comparing them with manual tests. An optimized prompt was developed, that integrates code and requirements, covering critical cases such as equivalence partitions and boundary values. The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements. Although flexible and promising, LLMs still require human supervision. This work highlights the importance of manual qualitative analysis as an essential complement to automation in unit test evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision at Jornadas de Cloud Computing, Big Data & Emerging Topics (JCC-BD&ET) - 2025</p></details> |

Scalability challenges, increasing demand, and ongoing code changes can contribute to such failures. As software architectures evolve rapidly, understanding how and why incidents occur is crucial for enhancing system reliability. In this study, we introduce Carbon Health's software stack, share our microservices journey, and analyze 107 incidents. Based on these incidents, we share insights and lessons learned on microservice decomposition. Finally, we suggest that starting with monolithic modularization as an initial step toward microservice decomposition may help reduce incidents and contribute to building more resilient software.</p></details> | EASE 2025 |

This approach is particularly valuable for scientific computing applications in which comprehensive tests are needed to prevent flawed results or conclusions. As scientific discovery becomes increasingly more complex, domain scientists couple multiple scientific computing models or simulations to solve intricate multiphysics and multiscale problems. These model-coupling applications use a hardwired coupling program or a flexible web service to link and combine different models. In this paper, we focus on the quality assurance of the more elastic web service via a combination of rigorous specification and testing methods. The application of statistical testing exposes problems ignored by pre-written unit tests and highlights areas in the code where failures might occur. We certify the model-coupling server controller with a derived reliability statistic, offering a quantitative measure to support a claim of its robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to SEKE2025</p></details> |
| **[Customizing a Large Language Model for VHDL Design of High-Performance Microprocessors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09610v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hardware design has taken off in recent years, principally through its incorporation in tools that increase chip designer productivity. There has been considerable discussion about the use of LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language, but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design, and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIGRATION-BENCH: Repository-Level Code Migration Benchmark from Java 8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09569v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of powerful large language models (LLMs) in recent years, a wide range of software engineering tasks can now be addressed using LLMs, significantly enhancing productivity and scalability. Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on problem-solving and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MIGRATION-BENCH with a distinct focus: code migration. MIGRATION-BENCH aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java 8 to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java 17, 21), MIGRATION-BENCH includes a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java 17. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves 62.33% and 27.00% success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience and https://github.com/amazon-science/self_debug respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding the Impact of Data Bugs on Deep Learning Models in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12137v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved significant success in various software engineering tasks (e.g., code completion by Copilot). However, DL systems are prone to bugs from many sources, including training data. Existing literature suggests that bugs in training data are highly prevalent, but little research has focused on understanding their impacts on the models used in software engineering tasks. In this paper, we address this research gap through a comprehensive empirical investigation focused on three types of data prevalent in software engineering tasks: code-based, text-based, and metric-based. Using state-of-the-art baselines, we compare the models trained on clean datasets with those trained on datasets with quality issues and without proper preprocessing. By analysing the gradients, weights, and biases from neural networks under training, we identify the symptoms of data quality and preprocessing issues. Our analysis reveals that quality issues in code data cause biased learning and gradient instability, whereas problems in text data lead to overfitting and poor generalisation of models. On the other hand, quality issues in metric data result in exploding gradients and model overfitting, and inadequate preprocessing exacerbates these effects across all three data types. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and generalizability of our findings using six new datasets. Our research provides a better understanding of the impact and symptoms of data bugs in software engineering datasets. Practitioners and researchers can leverage these findings to develop better monitoring systems and data-cleaning methods to help detect and resolve data bugs in deep learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Major Revision at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |

However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 16 figures, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (2025)</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/SceneGenAgent .</p></details> |  |

Although many tools generate UML diagrams from UML code, generating executable UML code from image-based UML diagrams remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach to generate UML code using a large multimodal language model automatically. Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models. The experiments measured code generation accuracy across different model sizes and training strategies. These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams. This will enable the modernization of legacy systems and decrease the manual effort in software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Journal of Machine Learning with Applications, Author Contributions: Averi Bates: Methodology, Development, Analysis, Data Curation, Drafting, Review.

While platform evolution and smart contracts' inherent immutability necessitate migrations both across and within chains, migrating the vast amounts of critical data in these contracts while maintaining data integrity and minimizing operational disruption presents a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we present SmartShift, a framework that enables secure and efficient smart contract migrations through intelligent state partitioning and progressive function activation, preserving operational continuity during transitions. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartShift significantly reduces migration downtime while ensuring robust security, establishing a foundation for efficient and secure smart contract migration systems.</p></details> |  |
