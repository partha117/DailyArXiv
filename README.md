| **[From Code Changes to Quality Gains: An Empirical Study in Python ML Systems with PyQu](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02827v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS), software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners, educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[1 PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Investigating the Experience of Autistic Individuals in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02736v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) leads to various issues in the everyday life of autistic individuals, often resulting in unemployment and mental health problems. To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants. We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance. Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReleaseEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in Automated Release Note Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02713v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated release note generation addresses the challenge of documenting frequent software updates, where manual efforts are time-consuming and prone to human error. Although recent advances in language models further enhance this process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and (3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs. Both automated and human evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while still struggling on diff2sum. These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting from long code diffs.</p></details> |  |

Learner responses are analyzed by a Generative AI powered server, which delivers personalized feedback and adaptive support. Results from a user evaluation indicate that participants found the system both easy to use and effective for building knowledge related to climate resilience.

| **[Assessing and Advancing Benchmarks for Evaluating Large Language Models in Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08903v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in software engineering (SE) due to their unprecedented performance across various applications. These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 291 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDPR-Relevant Privacy Concerns in Mobile Apps Research: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19142v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is considered as the benchmark in the European Union (EU) for privacy and data protection standards. Since before its entry into force in 2018, substantial research has been conducted in the software engineering (SE) literature investigating the elicitation, representation, and verification of GDPR privacy requirements. Software systems deployed anywhere in the world must comply with GDPR as long as they handle personal data of EU residents. Mobile applications (apps) are no different in that regard. With the growing pervasiveness of mobile apps and their increasing demand for personal data, privacy concerns have acquired further interest within the SE community. Despite the extensive literature on GDPR-relevant privacy concerns in mobile apps, there is no secondary study that describes, analyzes, and categorizes the current focus. Research gaps and persistent challenges are thus left unnoticed. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing research on GDPR privacy concerns in the context of mobile apps. To do so, we conducted a systematic literature review of 60 primary studies. Our findings show that existing studies predominantly address three key GDPR-related privacy concerns: (i) the direct collection of personal data from users, (ii) the sharing of personal data with external entities (e.g., third parties) beyond the mobile apps, and (iii) the analysis of user consent as a legal basis for collecting personal data. Our study highlighted research gaps, calling for further research to better understand: (i) the indirect collection of personal data, e.g., data exposed to mobile apps through, e.g., permission requests, (ii) the impact of legal bases beyond consent and how they may affect the development of mobile apps, and (iii) the required implementation details pertinent to data subject rights.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-rebench: An Automated Pipeline for Task Collection and Decontaminated Evaluation of Software Engineering Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20411v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nebius/SWE-rebench, SWE-rebench leaderboard https://swe-rebench.com NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While ChatGPT's potential has been extensively discussed, there is limited empirical evidence exploring its real-world usage by developers. This study bridges this gap by conducting a large-scale empirical analysis of ChatGPT-assisted development activities, leveraging a curated dataset, DevChat, comprising 2,547 unique shared ChatGPT links collected from GitHub between May 2023 and June 2024. Our study examines the characteristics of ChatGPT's usage on GitHub (including the tendency, prompt turns distribution, and link descriptions) and identifies five categories of developers' purposes for sharing developer-ChatGPT conversations during software development. Additionally, we analyzed the development-related activities where developers shared ChatGPT links to facilitate their workflows. We then established a mapping framework among data sources, activities, and SE tasks associated with these shared ChatGPT links. Our study offers a comprehensive view of ChatGPT's application in real-world software development scenarios and provides a foundation for its future integration into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 images, 3 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Emotional Contagion in Code: How GitHub Emoji Reactions Shape Developer Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02515v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developer communities increasingly rely on emoji reactions to communicate, but we know little about how these emotional signals spread and influence technical discussions. We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across 50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We identified five distinct patterns, with "instant enthusiasm" affecting 45.6% of items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p<0.001) with a massive effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional signals create measurable ripple effects. Our work provides empirical evidence that emoji reactions are not mere decoration but active forces shaping collaborative outcomes in software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Lost in Code Generation: Reimagining the Role of Software Models in AI-driven Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02475v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI enables rapid ``vibe coding," where natural language prompts yield working software systems. While this lowers barriers to software creation, it also collapses the boundary between prototypes and engineered software, leading to fragile systems that lack robustness, security, and maintainability. We argue that this shift motivates a reimagining of software models. Rather than serving only as upfront blueprints, models can be recovered post-hoc from AI-generated code to restore comprehension, expose risks, and guide refinement. In this role, models serve as mediators between human intent, AI generation, and long-term system evolution, providing a path toward sustainable AI-driven software engineering.</p></details> |  |

| **[Formalizing Regression Testing for Agile and Continuous Integration Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02810v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software developed using modern agile practices delivers a stream of software versions that require continuous regression testing rather than testing once close to the delivery or maintenance phase, as assumed by classical regression-testing theory. In this work, we formalize the phenomenon of continuous or near-continuous regression testing using successive builds as a time-ordered chain, where each build contains the program, requirements, and the accompanying tests. We also formalize the regression test window between any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for the classical two-version case. The formalization is validated by directly representing two state-of-the-art agile regression testing algorithms in terms of build-tuple operations without requiring auxiliary assumptions, followed by proof of the soundness and completeness of our formalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the first attempt to formalize regression testing in agile context as a continuous/near-continuos activity. This formalization will help practitioners and researchers to answer 'when', 'what' and 'how much' question of regression testing in real world time constrained agile projects.

Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering - transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of LLM-Based Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01176v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various software engineering tasks, such as code generation and debugging, because of their ability to translate between programming languages and natural languages. Existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in code clone detection. However, two crucial issues remain unaddressed: the ability of LLMs to achieve comparable performance across different datasets and the consistency of LLMs' responses in code clone detection. To address these issues, we constructed seven code clone datasets and then evaluated five LLMs in four existing prompts with these datasets. The datasets were created by sampling code pairs using their Levenshtein ratio from two different code collections, CodeNet and BigCloneBench. Our evaluation revealed that although LLMs perform well in CodeNet-related datasets, with o3-mini achieving a 0.943 F1 score, their performance significantly decreased in BigCloneBench-related datasets. Most models achieved a high response consistency, with over 90\% of judgments remaining consistent across all five submissions. The fluctuations of the F1 score affected by inconsistency are also tiny; their variations are less than 0.03.</p></details> |  |
| **[HarnessLLM: Automatic Testing Harness Generation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01104v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM-based automatic test generation methods mainly produce input and expected output pairs to categorize the intended behavior of correct programs. Although straightforward, these methods have limited diversity in generated tests and cannot provide enough debugging information. We propose HarnessLLM, a two-stage training pipeline that enables LLMs to write harness code for testing. Particularly, LLMs generate code that synthesizes inputs and validates the observed outputs, allowing complex test cases and flexible output validation such as invariant checking. To achieve this, we train LLMs with SFT followed by RLVR with a customized reward design. Experiments show that HarnessLLM outperforms input-output-based testing in bug finding and testing strategy diversity. HarnessLLM further benefits the code generation performance through test-time scaling with our generated test cases as inference-phase validation. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/HarnessLLM.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentGit: A Version Control Framework for Reliable and Scalable LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00628v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) are drawing increasing interest across academia and industry. However, many current MAS frameworks struggle with reliability and scalability, especially on complex tasks. We present AgentGit, a framework that brings Git-like rollback and branching to MAS workflows. Built as an infrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit, revert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore multiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an experiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts. We ran a multi-step A/B test against three baselines -- LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno -- on a real-world task: retrieving and analyzing paper abstracts. Results show that AgentGit significantly reduces redundant computation, lowers runtime and token usage, and supports parallel exploration across multiple branches, enhancing both reliability and scalability in MAS development. This work offers a practical path to more robust MAS design and enables error recovery, safe exploration, iterative debugging, and A/B testing in collaborative AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> | Accepted at ASE 2025 |

Most novice programmer bugs are caused by programming misconceptions, namely false beliefs about a programming concept. In this context, Socratic debugging can be formulated as a guided Reasoning Trajectory (RT) leading to a statement about the program behavior that contradicts the bug-causing misconception. Upon reaching this statement, the ensuing cognitive dissonance leads the student to first identify and then update their false belief. In this paper, we introduce the task of reasoning trajectory generation, together with a dataset of debugging problems manually annotated with RTs. We then describe LLM-based solutions for generating RTs and Socratic conversations that are anchored on them. A large-scale LLM-as-judge evaluation shows that frontier models can generate up to 91% correct reasoning trajectories and 98.7% valid conversation turns.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 tables, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Stitch: Step-by-step LLM Guided Tutoring for Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26634v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in programming education. While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills. We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved. We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current automated feedback generation tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online and Interactive Bayesian Inference Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26579v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Nexus: Execution-Grounded Multi-Agent Test Oracle Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26423v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement. During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Automated Program Repair Based on REST API Specifications Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25148v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many cloud services provide REST API accessible to client applications. However, developers often identify specification violations only during testing, as error messages typically lack the detail necessary for effective diagnosis. Consequently, debugging requires trial and error. This study proposes dcFix, a method for detecting and automatically repairing REST API misuses in client programs. In particular, dcFix identifies non-conforming code fragments, integrates them with the relevant API specifications into prompts, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the corrected code. Our evaluation demonstrates that dcFix accurately detects misuse and outperforms the baseline approach, in which prompts to the LLM omit any indication of code fragments non conforming to REST API specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGNET: A Multi-Graph Attentional Network for Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24241v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection is a fundamental task in software engineering that underpins refactoring, debugging, plagiarism detection, and vulnerability analysis. Existing methods often rely on singular representations such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs (CFGs), and data flow graphs (DFGs), which capture only partial aspects of code semantics. Hybrid approaches have emerged, but their fusion strategies are typically handcrafted and ineffective. In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional framework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture syntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual graph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and long-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for fine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse multi-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive experiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\% and 99.2\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZixianReid/Multigraph_match</p></details> |  |
| **[TDFlow: Agentic Workflows for Test Driven Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23761v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TDFlow, a novel test-driven agentic workflow that frames repository-scale software engineering as a test-resolution task, specifically designed to solve human-written tests. Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly proposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely engineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective sub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch revision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any individual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined sub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific sub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on SWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and 94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within SWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which were subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary obstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing successful reproduction tests. We envision a human-LLM interactive system powered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems. Together, these results indicate that modern LLMs, when embedded in a narrowly engineered, test-driven workflow, already achieve human-level test resolution -- with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the accurate generation of valid reproduction tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[SBEST: Spectrum-Based Fault Localization Without Fault-Triggering Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00565v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization is a critical step in software maintenance. Yet, many existing techniques, such as Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL), rely heavily on the availability of fault-triggering tests to be effective. In practice, especially for crash-related bugs, such tests are frequently unavailable. Meanwhile, bug reports containing stack traces often serve as the only available evidence of runtime failures and provide valuable context for debugging. This study investigates the feasibility of using stack traces from crash reports as proxies for fault-triggering tests in SBFL. Our empirical analysis of 60 crash-report bugs in Defects4J reveals that only 3.33% of these bugs have fault-triggering tests available at the time of the bug report creation. However, 98.3% of bug fixes directly address the exception observed in the stack trace, and 78.3% of buggy methods are reachable within an average of 0.34 method calls from the stack trace. These findings underscore the diagnostic value of stack traces in the absence of failing tests. Motivated by these findings, we propose SBEST, a novel approach that integrates stack trace information with test coverage data to perform fault localization when fault-triggering tests are missing. SBEST shows an improvement, with a 32.22% increase in Mean Average Precision (MAP) and a 17.43% increase in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) compared to baseline approaches under the scenario where fault-triggering tests are absent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Empir...</summary><p>Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |

Yet few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, potentially due to the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench has 111 curated and reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific out-of-order execution issue. To support reproducibility and ease of use, JunoBench offers a unified execution environment where crashes and fixes can be reliably reproduced. By providing realistic crashes and their resolutions, JunoBench facilitates bug detection, localization, diagnosis, and repair tailored to the interactive and iterative nature of notebook-based ML development.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisCoder2: Building Multi-Language Visualization Coding Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23642v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage, unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents. VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching 82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or compiler-dependent languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering: the Road Ahead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04797v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to handle the increasing complexity of software systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied to various areas of software engineering, including requirements engineering, coding, testing, and debugging. This has led to the emergence of AI for Software Engineering as a distinct research area within the field of software engineering. With the development of quantum computing, the field of Quantum AI (QAI) is arising, enhancing the performance of classical AI and holding significant potential for solving classical software engineering problems. Some initial applications of QAI in software engineering have already emerged, such as test case optimization. However, the path ahead remains open, offering ample opportunities to solve complex software engineering problems cost-effectively with QAI. To this end, this paper presents a roadmap towards the application of QAI in software engineering. Specifically, we consider two of the main categories of QAI, i.e., quantum optimization algorithms and quantum machine learning. For each software engineering phase, we discuss how these QAI approaches can address some of the tasks associated with that phase. Moreover, we provide an overview of some of the possible challenges that need to be addressed to make the application of QAI for software engineering successful.</p></details> |  |
| **[FidelityGPT: Correcting Decompilation Distortions with Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19615v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompilation converts machine code into human-readable form, enabling analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89% and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%, Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.</p></details> |  |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |
| **[InspectCoder: Dynamic Analysis-Enabled Self Repair through interactive LLM-Debugger Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18327v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhyFlow: Interrogative Debugger for Sensemaking Taint Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |

Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Final Code: A Process-Oriented Error Analysis of Software Development Agents in Real-World GitHub Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICSE 2026, Research Track</p></details> |

A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon their submissions after repeated TLE failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely performance issues. Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same 1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.</p></details> |  |

Automated repair of such failures is promising, but existing techniques rely on test cases, which are not available for non-compilable code. We employ an automated repair approach for compilation errors driven by large language models (LLMs). Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000 commits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours typically required for manual debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference: 2025 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)</p></details> |

Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |

The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69 AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95% CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90% relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1 inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus 28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%) occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points; arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven, provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis with end-to-end auditability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, link to code repo</p></details> |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

However, the reality of video games require its own set of unique debugging techniques such as On-Screen Console, Debug Draws, Debug Camera, Cheats and In-Game Menus, and Data Scrubbing. In this article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, gas 2026 conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |
| **[Traceability and Accountability in Role-Specialized Multi-Agent LLM Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07614v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite their importance, no existing evaluation benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework, HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting in Practice: Investigating Software Developers' Use of Generative AI Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06000v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has fundamentally transformed software development. Although prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill, existing research focuses primarily on individual techniques rather than software developers' broader workflows. This study presents a systematic investigation of how software engineers integrate GenAI tools into their professional practice through a large-scale survey examining prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across various software engineering tasks. We surveyed 91 software engineers, including 72 active GenAI users, to understand AI usage patterns throughout the development process. Our 14 key findings show that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency strongly correlates with using AI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and code review, and that developers prefer iterative multi-turn conversations to single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable, while complex code generation and debugging present sizable challenges. Our insights provide an empirical baseline of current developer practices, from simple code generation to deeper workflow integration, with actionable insights for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |

While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.</p></details> |  |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging approach should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with the tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |

Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap, this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity. Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes. Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts. Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences, necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |
| **[Vibe Coding in Practice: Motivations, Challenges, and a Future Outlook -- a Grey Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00328v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools are transforming software development, especially for novice and non-software developers, by enabling them to write code and build applications faster and with little to no human intervention. Vibe coding is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code. Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101 practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools' outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers, particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping, but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.</p></details> |  |

We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJjFfnxUx0.</p></details> |  |
| **[TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.</p></details> |  |

Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress (V2)</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence-Guided Concolic Testing of Transformer Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23806v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an {influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible, pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring, compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that (i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration, and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering potential utility for debugging and model auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Specific Instruction: A Longitudinal Study on Debugging Skill Acquisition and Retention for Novice Programmers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22420v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localization is a critical skill, yet novices often lack systematic approaches. Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps; the impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week longitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract guidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that pairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4). Forty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5). Each session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element containing a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to completion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and strategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to completion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other groups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p < 0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other groups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses showed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants internalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that context-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger retention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions produced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized performance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may bridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more equitable path for novices.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (25 pages for the paper, rest pages are references and appendix). 4 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[SecureAgentBench: Benchmarking Secure Code Generation under Realistic Vulnerability Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22097v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents (SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions, (ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step toward more reliable software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |

Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Co-evolutionary Metamorphic Differential Testing for Autonomous Systems with an Interpretability Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16478v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, such as autonomous driving systems, evolve rapidly through frequent updates, risking unintended behavioral degradations. Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment. CoCoMagic offers an efficient, effective, and interpretable way for the differential testing of evolving autonomous systems across versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous systems, giving rise to a new class of software known as Agentware, where LLM-powered agents perform complex, open-ended tasks in domains such as software engineering, customer service, and data analysis. However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |
| **[From Legacy Fortran to Portable Kokkos: An Autonomous Agentic AI Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12443v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of Programmers' Trust in Generative AI Programming Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13253v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation. Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |

A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rethinking Technology Stack Selection with AI Coding Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11132v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now an integral part of software development workflows and are reshaping the whole process. Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[ViScratch: Using Large Language Models and Gameplay Videos for Automated Feedback in Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11065v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based programming environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in programming education, in particular for young learners. While the use of blocks helps prevent syntax errors, semantic bugs remain common and difficult to debug. Existing tools for Scratch debugging rely heavily on predefined rules or user manual inputs, and crucially, they ignore the platform's inherently visual nature. We introduce ViScratch, the first multimodal feedback generation system for Scratch that leverages both the project's block code and its generated gameplay video to diagnose and repair bugs. ViScratch uses a two-stage pipeline: a vision-language model first aligns visual symptoms with code structure to identify a single critical issue, then proposes minimal, abstract syntax tree level repairs that are verified via execution in the Scratch virtual machine. We evaluate ViScratch on a set of real-world Scratch projects against state-of-the-art LLM-based tools and human testers. Results show that gameplay video is a crucial debugging signal: ViScratch substantially outperforms prior tools in both bug identification and repair quality, even without access to project descriptions or goals. This work demonstrates that video can serve as a first-class specification in visual programming environments, opening new directions for LLM-based debugging beyond symbolic code alone.</p></details> |  |

To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants. We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance. Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers.</p></details> |  |

Although straightforward, these methods have limited diversity in generated tests and cannot provide enough debugging information. We propose HarnessLLM, a two-stage training pipeline that enables LLMs to write harness code for testing. Particularly, LLMs generate code that synthesizes inputs and validates the observed outputs, allowing complex test cases and flexible output validation such as invariant checking. To achieve this, we train LLMs with SFT followed by RLVR with a customized reward design. Experiments show that HarnessLLM outperforms input-output-based testing in bug finding and testing strategy diversity. HarnessLLM further benefits the code generation performance through test-time scaling with our generated test cases as inference-phase validation. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/HarnessLLM.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAFixAgent: History-Aware Automated Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01047v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has recently shifted toward large language models and agent-based systems, yet most systems rely on local snapshot context, overlooking repository history. Prior work shows that repository history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |
| **[CodeClash: Benchmarking Goal-Oriented Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00839v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current benchmarks for coding evaluate language models (LMs) on concrete, well-specified tasks such as fixing specific bugs or writing targeted tests. However, human programmers do not spend all day incessantly addressing isolated tasks. Instead, real-world software development is grounded in the pursuit of high-level goals, like improving user retention or reducing costs. Evaluating whether LMs can also iteratively develop code to better accomplish open-ended objectives without any explicit guidance remains an open challenge. To address this, we introduce CodeClash, a benchmark where LMs compete in multi-round tournaments to build the best codebase for achieving a competitive objective. Each round proceeds in two phases: agents edit their code, then their codebases compete head-to-head in a code arena that determines winners based on objectives like score maximization, resource acquisition, or survival. Whether it's writing notes, scrutinizing documentation, analyzing competition logs, or creating test suites, models must decide for themselves how to improve their codebases both absolutely and against their opponents. We run 1680 tournaments (25,200 rounds total) to evaluate 8 LMs across 6 arenas. Our results reveal that while models exhibit diverse development styles, they share fundamental limitations in strategic reasoning. Models also struggle with long-term codebase maintenance, as repositories become progressively messy and redundant. These limitations are stark: top models lose every round against expert human programmers. We open-source CodeClash to advance the study of autonomous, goal-oriented code development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Detect Real-World Android Software Compliance Violations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00624v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed software engineering, showing promise in tasks like code generation, bug detection, and compliance checking. However, current models struggle to detect compliance violations in Android applications across diverse legal frameworks. We propose \emph{CompliBench}, a novel evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' ability to detect compliance violations under regulations like LGPD, PDPA, and PIPEDA. The framework defines two tasks: Task 1 evaluates \emph{retrieval and localization} at file, module, and line granularities, and Task 2 assesses \emph{multi-label judgment} for code snippets. These tasks mirror the audit process, where auditors locate problematic code and determine implicated provisions. Traditional metrics fail to capture important aspects like cross-granularity stability and jurisdictional consistency. Thus, we introduce stability-aware composites (SGS, RCS, CRGS, and OCS) for a more comprehensive assessment. Experiments with six models, including GPT-4O and Claude-3.5, show \emph{CompliBench} improves compliance detection, with Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 achieving the highest OCS score (0.3295), and Gemini-2.5-pro the lowest (0.0538). This work demonstrates \emph{CompliBench}'s potential for improving LLM performance in compliance tasks and provides a foundation for future tools aligned with data protection standards.

Various automated review comment generation techniques have been proposed to streamline the labor-intensive process. However, existing approaches heavily rely on a single model to identify various issues within the code, limiting the model's ability to handle the diverse, issue-specific nature of code changes and leading to non-informative comments, especially in complex scenarios such as bug fixes. To address these limitations, we propose RevAgent, a novel agent-based issue-oriented framework, decomposes the task into three stages: (1) Generation Stage, where five category-specific commentator agents analyze code changes from distinct issue perspectives and generate candidate comments; (2) Discrimination Stage, where a critic agent selects the most appropriate issue-comment pair; and (3) Training Stage, where all agents are fine-tuned on curated, category-specific data to enhance task specialization. Evaluation results show that RevAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PLM- and LLM-based baselines, with improvements of 12.90\%, 10.87\%, 6.32\%, and 8.57\% on BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and SBERT, respectively. It also achieves relatively higher accuracy in issue-category identification, particularly for challenging scenarios. Human evaluations further validate the practicality of RevAgent in generating accurate, readable, and context-aware review comments. Moreover, RevAgent delivers a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we formalize the phenomenon of continuous or near-continuous regression testing using successive builds as a time-ordered chain, where each build contains the program, requirements, and the accompanying tests. We also formalize the regression test window between any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for the classical two-version case. The formalization is validated by directly representing two state-of-the-art agile regression testing algorithms in terms of build-tuple operations without requiring auxiliary assumptions, followed by proof of the soundness and completeness of our formalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the first attempt to formalize regression testing in agile context as a continuous/near-continuos activity.

To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants. We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance. Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReleaseEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in Automated Release Note Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02713v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated release note generation addresses the challenge of documenting frequent software updates, where manual efforts are time-consuming and prone to human error. Although recent advances in language models further enhance this process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and (3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs. Both automated and human evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while still struggling on diff2sum. These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting from long code diffs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on self-consistency or simulation feedback to select the best candidate, but they miss opportunities to focus LLM reasoning on the most informative parts of the design. We propose VFocus, a three-stage framework that enhances Verilog generation by sharpening the focus of LLM reasoning onto critical decision points in the code generation process. In the \textbf{pre-ranking stage}, VFocus generates multiple code candidates through LLM prompting, retries for syntactically valid outputs, and introduces a \textit{Density-guided Filtering} to retain candidates that fall within the "reasoning sweet spot" for functional correctness. In the \textbf{ranking stage}, we simulate each code candidate using an automatically generated testbench and apply self-consistency-based clustering to identify the most consistent outputs. Finally, in the \textbf{post-ranking refinement stage}, VFocus performs inconsistency mining on top-ranked candidates and invokes reasoning-augmented LLM prompts for candidate refinement. Experiments on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark show that VFocus significantly improves the pass@1 correctness across multiple reasoning LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing Verilog generation for complex hardware design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by SOCC 2025</p></details> |

| **[From Code Changes to Quality Gains: An Empirical Study in Python ML Systems with PyQu](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02827v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS), software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners, educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering</p></details> |

| **[1 PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</p></details> | Under review |

These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 291 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |

Since before its entry into force in 2018, substantial research has been conducted in the software engineering (SE) literature investigating the elicitation, representation, and verification of GDPR privacy requirements. Software systems deployed anywhere in the world must comply with GDPR as long as they handle personal data of EU residents. Mobile applications (apps) are no different in that regard. With the growing pervasiveness of mobile apps and their increasing demand for personal data, privacy concerns have acquired further interest within the SE community. Despite the extensive literature on GDPR-relevant privacy concerns in mobile apps, there is no secondary study that describes, analyzes, and categorizes the current focus. Research gaps and persistent challenges are thus left unnoticed. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing research on GDPR privacy concerns in the context of mobile apps. To do so, we conducted a systematic literature review of 60 primary studies. Our findings show that existing studies predominantly address three key GDPR-related privacy concerns: (i) the direct collection of personal data from users, (ii) the sharing of personal data with external entities (e.g., third parties) beyond the mobile apps, and (iii) the analysis of user consent as a legal basis for collecting personal data. Our study highlighted research gaps, calling for further research to better understand: (i) the indirect collection of personal data, e.g., data exposed to mobile apps through, e.g., permission requests, (ii) the impact of legal bases beyond consent and how they may affect the development of mobile apps, and (iii) the required implementation details pertinent to data subject rights.</p></details> |  |

However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nebius/SWE-rebench, SWE-rebench leaderboard https://swe-rebench.com NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While ChatGPT's potential has been extensively discussed, there is limited empirical evidence exploring its real-world usage by developers. This study bridges this gap by conducting a large-scale empirical analysis of ChatGPT-assisted development activities, leveraging a curated dataset, DevChat, comprising 2,547 unique shared ChatGPT links collected from GitHub between May 2023 and June 2024. Our study examines the characteristics of ChatGPT's usage on GitHub (including the tendency, prompt turns distribution, and link descriptions) and identifies five categories of developers' purposes for sharing developer-ChatGPT conversations during software development. Additionally, we analyzed the development-related activities where developers shared ChatGPT links to facilitate their workflows. We then established a mapping framework among data sources, activities, and SE tasks associated with these shared ChatGPT links. Our study offers a comprehensive view of ChatGPT's application in real-world software development scenarios and provides a foundation for its future integration into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 images, 3 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across 50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We identified five distinct patterns, with "instant enthusiasm" affecting 45.6% of items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p<0.001) with a massive effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional signals create measurable ripple effects.

While this lowers barriers to software creation, it also collapses the boundary between prototypes and engineered software, leading to fragile systems that lack robustness, security, and maintainability. We argue that this shift motivates a reimagining of software models. Rather than serving only as upfront blueprints, models can be recovered post-hoc from AI-generated code to restore comprehension, expose risks, and guide refinement. In this role, models serve as mediators between human intent, AI generation, and long-term system evolution, providing a path toward sustainable AI-driven software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Although RE is fundamental to software engineering, limited research has examined AI adoption in RE. We surveyed 55 software practitioners to map AI usage across four RE phases: Elicitation, Analysis, Specification, and Validation, and four approaches for decision making: human-only decisions, AI validation, Human AI Collaboration (HAIC), and full AI automation. Participants also shared their perceptions, challenges, and opportunities when applying AI for RE tasks. Our data show that 58.2% of respondents already use AI in RE, and 69.1% view its impact as positive or very positive.HAIC dominates practice, accounting for 54.4% of all RE techniques, while full AI automation remains minimal at 5.4%. Passive AI validation (4.4 to 6.2%) lags even further behind, indicating that practitioners value AI's active support over passive oversight. These findings suggest that AI is most effective when positioned as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human expertise. It also highlights the need for RE-specific HAIC frameworks along with robust and responsible AI governance as AI adoption in RE grows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Intelligent Software Engineering (ISE) 2025 Workshop at the Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

However, fully adopting CSE is often constrained by complex products, legacy systems, organizational inertia, and regulatory requirements. In this paper, we examine four industrial cases from the automation, automotive, retail, and chemical sectors to explore how such constraints shape CSE adoption in practice. Methods: We apply and extend a previously proposed CSE Industry Readiness Model to assess the current and potential levels of adoption in each case. Through expert interviews and narrative synthesis, we identify common driving forces and adoption barriers, including organizational preparedness, cross-organizational dependencies, and limited customer demand for continuous delivery. Results: Based on our findings, we propose an updated readiness model that introduces additional levels of internal and external feedback, distinguishes market- and organization-facing constraints, and better guides practitioners in setting realistic CSE adoption goals. Conclusions: Our results highlight that while full end-to-end CSE adoption may not always be feasible, meaningful internal improvements are still possible and beneficial. This study provides empirically grounded guidance for organizations navigating partial or constrained CSE transformations.</p></details> |  |

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

LLM-assisted Software Traceability with Architecture Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02434v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying architecturally relevant entities in textual artifacts is crucial for Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) between Software Architecture Documentation (SAD) and source code. While Software Architecture Models (SAMs) can bridge the semantic gap between these artifacts, their manual creation is time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new capabilities for extracting architectural entities from SAD and source code to construct SAMs automatically or establish direct trace links. This paper presents two LLM-based approaches: ExArch extracts component names as simple SAMs from SAD and source code to eliminate the need for manual SAM creation, while ArTEMiS identifies architectural entities in documentation and matches them with (manually or automatically generated) SAM entities. Our evaluation compares against state-of-the-art approaches SWATTR, TransArC and ArDoCode. TransArC achieves strong performance (F1: 0.87) but requires manually created SAMs; ExArch achieves comparable results (F1: 0.86) using only SAD and code. ArTEMiS is on par with the traditional heuristic-based SWATTR (F1: 0.81) and can successfully replace it when integrated with TransArC. The combination of ArTEMiS and ExArch outperforms ArDoCode, the best baseline without manual SAMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively identify architectural entities in textual artifacts, enabling automated SAM generation and TLR, making architecture-code traceability more practical and accessible.</p></details> |  |

The packages feature a highly efficient hybrid coordinate descent algorithm that fits generalized linear models (GLMs) and supports a variety of loss functions, including Gaussian, binomial, Poisson, and multinomial logistic regression. Our implementation is designed to be fast, memory-efficient, and flexible. The packages support a variety of data structures (dense, sparse, and out-of-memory matrices) and are designed to efficiently fit the full SLOPE path as well as handle cross-validation of SLOPE models, including the relaxed SLOPE. We present examples of how to use the packages and benchmarks that demonstrate the performance of the packages on both real and simulated data and show that our packages outperform existing implementations of SLOPE in terms of speed.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines, which oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by 16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for complex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing iterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of base LLMs to better support iterative software development.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, C# -- a prominent enterprise language ranking #5 in the TIOBE index -- remains absent from such benchmarks. We introduce SWE-Sharp-Bench, a reproducible software engineering benchmark for C\# featuring 150 instances from 17 repositories. Evaluating identical model-agent configurations across languages reveals a significant performance gap: while 70% of Python tasks in SWE-Bench Verified are solved, $only 40% of our C\# tasks are resolved. We open-source SWE-Sharp-Bench and our entire curation pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on self-consistency or simulation feedback to select the best candidate, but they miss opportunities to focus LLM reasoning on the most informative parts of the design. We propose VFocus, a three-stage framework that enhances Verilog generation by sharpening the focus of LLM reasoning onto critical decision points in the code generation process. In the \textbf{pre-ranking stage}, VFocus generates multiple code candidates through LLM prompting, retries for syntactically valid outputs, and introduces a \textit{Density-guided Filtering} to retain candidates that fall within the "reasoning sweet spot" for functional correctness. In the \textbf{ranking stage}, we simulate each code candidate using an automatically generated testbench and apply self-consistency-based clustering to identify the most consistent outputs. Finally, in the \textbf{post-ranking refinement stage}, VFocus performs inconsistency mining on top-ranked candidates and invokes reasoning-augmented LLM prompts for candidate refinement. Experiments on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark show that VFocus significantly improves the pass@1 correctness across multiple reasoning LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing Verilog generation for complex hardware design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by SOCC 2025</p></details> |

They can be used in the specification of autonomous driving, avionics, air traffic control, and similar systems. They aim to reduce risks of harm of all kinds including human mortality, environmental damage, and financial loss. However, assurance cases often tend to be organized as extensive documents spanning hundreds of pages, making their creation, review, and maintenance error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious. Therefore, there is a growing need to leverage (semi-)automated techniques, such as those powered by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), to enhance efficiency, consistency, and accuracy across the entire assurance-case lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on assurance case review, a critical task that ensures the quality of assurance cases and therefore fosters their acceptance by regulatory authorities. We propose a novel approach that leverages the \textit{LLM-as-a-judge} paradigm to automate the review process. Specifically, we propose new predicate-based rules that formalize well-established assurance case review criteria, allowing us to craft LLM prompts tailored to the review task. Our experiments on several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) show that, while most LLMs yield relatively good review capabilities, DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 demonstrate superior performance, with DeepSeek-R1 ultimately outperforming GPT-4.1. However, our experimental results also suggest that human reviewers are still needed to refine the reviews LLMs yield.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open the Oyster: Empirical Evaluation and Improvement of Code Reasoning Confidence in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02197v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of code intelligence, increasing attention has been paid to the reliability and controllability of their outputs in code reasoning tasks. Confidence estimation serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects. This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to $0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$ over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence mechanisms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Large Language Models for Natural Language Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02108v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using large language models (LLMs) to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks has become increasingly pervasive in recent times. The versatile nature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the performance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown that they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these faulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs. One obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which necessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors. Metamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this oracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define relationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty behaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This paper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We conducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We implemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments with three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests. The results shed light on the capabilities and opportunities of MT for LLMs, as well as its limitations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering - transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.</p></details> |  |

However, existing decompilation techniques often fail to produce source code that can be successfully recompiled and re-executed, particularly for optimized binaries. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled neural approaches to decompilation, but the generated code is typically only semantically plausible rather than truly executable, limiting their practical reliability. These shortcomings arise from compiler optimizations and the loss of semantic cues in compiled code, which LLMs struggle to recover without contextual guidance. To address this challenge, we propose ICL4Decomp, a hybrid decompilation framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) to guide LLMs toward generating re-executable source code. We evaluate our method across multiple datasets, optimization levels, and compilers, demonstrating around 40\% improvement in re-executability over state-of-the-art decompilation methods while maintaining robustness.</p></details> |  |

Despite hosting hundreds of reusable workflows across domains, Galaxy's current keyword-based retrieval system offers limited support for semantic query interpretation and often fails to surface relevant workflows when exact term matches are absent. To address this gap, we propose a task-aware, two-stage retrieval framework that integrates dense vector search with large language model (LLM)-based reranking. Our system first retrieves candidate workflows using state-of-the-art embedding models and then reranks them using instruction-tuned generative LLMs (GPT-4o, Mistral-7B) based on semantic task alignment. To support robust evaluation, we construct a benchmark dataset of Galaxy workflows annotated with semantic topics via BERTopic and synthesize realistic task-oriented queries using LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of lexical, dense, and reranking models using standard IR metrics, presenting the first systematic evaluation of retrieval performance in the Galaxy ecosystem. Results show that our approach significantly improves top-k accuracy and relevance, particularly for long or under-specified queries. We further integrate our system as a prototype tool within Galaxy, providing a proof-of-concept for LLM-enhanced workflow search. This work advances the usability and accessibility of scientific workflows, especially for novice users and interdisciplinary researchers.</p></details> |  |

However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track; switched to IEEE conference template</p></details> |

However, API parameters in these libraries often change during evolution, leading to compatibility issues for client applications reliant on specific versions. Python's flexible parameter-passing mechanism further complicates this, as different passing methods can result in different API compatibility. Currently, no tool can automatically detect and repair Python API parameter compatibility issues. To fill this gap, we introduce PCART, the first solution to fully automate the process of API extraction, code instrumentation, API mapping establishment, compatibility assessment, repair, and validation. PCART handles various types of Python API parameter compatibility issues, including parameter addition, removal, renaming, reordering, and the conversion of positional to keyword parameters. To evaluate PCART, we construct PCBENCH, a large-scale benchmark comprising 47,478 test cases mutated from 844 parameter-changed APIs across 33 popular Python libraries. Evaluation results demonstrate that PCART is both effective and efficient, significantly outperforming existing tools (MLCatchUp and Relancer) and the large language model ChatGPT (GPT-4o), achieving an F1-score of 96.51% in detecting API parameter compatibility issues and a repair precision of 91.97%. Further evaluation on 30 real-world Python projects from GitHub confirms PCART's practicality. We believe PCART can significantly reduce the time programmers spend maintaining Python API updates and advance the automation of Python API compatibility issue repair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

In practice, teams face not only technical issues like extreme class imbalance and data drift, but also organizational barriers such as bureaucratic data access, lack of versioned datasets, and incomplete governance over provenance and monitoring. Our study of the Brasil Participativo (BP) platform shows that common engineering choices -- like using LLMs for pre-labeling, splitting models into routed classifiers, and generating synthetic data -- can speed development but also introduce new traceability, reliability, and cost risks if not paired with disciplined data governance and human validation. This means that, in the public sector, responsible ML is not just a modeling problem but an institutional engineering problem, and ML pipelines must be treated as civic infrastructure. Ultimately, this study shows that the success of machine learning in the public sector will depend less on breakthroughs in model accuracy and more on the ability of institutions to engineer transparent, reproducible, and accountable data infrastructures that citizens can trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Detecting Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) is crucial for proactive software maintenance. Previous research has primarily targeted detecting and prioritizing SATD, with little focus on the source code afflicted with SATD. Our goal in this work is to connect the SATD comments with source code constructs that surround them. Method. We leverage the extensive SATD dataset PENTACET, containing code comments from over 9000 Java Open Source Software (OSS) repositories. We quantitatively infer where SATD most commonly occurs and which code constructs/statements it most frequently affects. Results and Conclusions. Our large-scale study links over 225,000 SATD comments to their surrounding code, showing that SATD mainly arises in inline code near definitions, conditionals, and exception handling, where developers face uncertainty and trade-offs, revealing it as an intentional signal of awareness during change rather than mere neglect.</p></details> |  |

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms effectively help designers identify trade-offs among the desired non-functional properties. To reduce the use of computational resources, this work examines the impact of implementing a search budget to limit the search for design alternatives. In particular, we analyze how time budgets affect the quality of Pareto fronts by utilizing quality indicators and exploring the structural features of the generated design alternatives. This study identifies distinct behavioral differences among evolutionary algorithms when a search budget is implemented. It further reveals that design alternatives generated under a budget are structurally different from those produced without one. Additionally, we offer recommendations for designers on selecting algorithms in relation to time constraints, thereby facilitating the effective application of automated refactoring to improve non-functional properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.08385</p></details> |

Ensuring their semantic correctness is challenging, since existing rule-based frameworks rely on manually written formulas and domain-specific functions, limiting scalability. In this paper, We present an LLM-assisted pipeline that jointly generates logical formulas and corresponding executable predicates within a computational FOL framework, extending the map verifier in CommonRoad scenario designer with elevation support. The pipeline leverages prompt-based LLM generation to produce grammar-compliant rules and predicates that integrate directly into the existing system. We implemented a prototype and evaluated it on synthetic bridge and slope scenarios. The results indicate reduced manual engineering effort while preserving correctness, demonstrating the feasibility of a scalable, semi-automated human-in-the-loop approach to map-transformation verification.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring that a COD instance lies within the ODD is a crucial step in safety assurance. Today, ODD and COD specifications are frequently expressed in YAML to remain accessible for stakeholders, but such descriptions are not directly suitable for solver-based verification. Manual translation into formal languages such as SMT-LIB is slow and error-prone. We present VeriODD, a tool that automates this translation. VeriODD uses ANTLR-based compiler technology to transform YAML-based ODD/COD specifications into both human-readable propositional logic, for lightweight review on a simple basis, and solver-ready SMT-LIB. The tool integrates with SMT solvers such as Z3 to provide automated consistency checks of ODD specifications and verification of COD conformance. A graphical user interface supports editing specifications, inspecting generated formulas, and performing verification with a single click. VeriODD thereby closes the gap between stakeholder-friendly ODD/COD notations and formal verification, enabling scalable and automated assurance of operational boundaries in autonomous driving.

Build infrastructure security poses unique challenges: the complexity of multi-component systems (source code, dependencies, build tools), the difficulty of detecting intrusions during compilation, and prevalent build non-determinism that masks malicious modifications. Despite these risks, the security community lacks a systematic understanding of build-specific attack vectors, hindering effective defense design. This paper presents an empirically-derived taxonomy of attack vectors targeting the build process, constructed through a large-scale CVE mining (of 621 vulnerability disclosures from the NVD database). We categorize attack vectors by their injection points across the build pipeline, from source code manipulation to compiler compromise. To validate our taxonomy, we analyzed 168 documented software supply chain attacks, identifying 40 incidents specifically targeting build phases. Our analysis reveals that 23.8\% of supply chain attacks exploit build vulnerabilities, with dependency confusion and build script injection representing the most prevalent vectors.

These systems create new opportunities for tool design, workflow orchestration, and empirical observation, while fundamentally reshaping the roles of developers and the artifacts they produce. Although traditional empirical methods remain central to software engineering research, the rapid evolution of AI introduces new data modalities, alters causal assumptions, and challenges foundational constructs such as "developer", "artifact", and "interaction". As humans and AI agents increasingly co-create, the boundaries between social and technical actors blur, and the reproducibility of findings becomes contingent on model updates and prompt contexts. This vision paper examines how the integration of LLMs into software engineering disrupts established research paradigms. We discuss how it transforms the phenomena we study, the methods and theories we rely on, the data we analyze, and the threats to validity that arise in dynamic AI-mediated environments. Our aim is to help the empirical software engineering community adapt its questions, instruments, and validation standards to a future in which AI systems are not merely tools, but active collaborators shaping software engineering and its study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware 2025)</p></details> |

While its use in coding tasks shows considerable promise, applying GenAI across the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has not yet been fully explored. Critical uncertainties in areas such as reliability, accountability, security, and data privacy demand deeper investigation and coordinated action. The GENIUS project, comprising over 30 European industrial and academic partners, aims to address these challenges by advancing AI integration across all SDLC phases. It focuses on GenAI's potential, the development of innovative tools, and emerging research challenges, actively shaping the future of software engineering. This vision paper presents a shared perspective on the future of GenAI-based software engineering, grounded in cross-sector dialogue and experience within the GENIUS consortium, supported by an exploratory literature review. The paper explores four central elements: (1) a structured overview of current challenges in GenAI adoption across the SDLC; (2) a forward-looking vision outlining key technological and methodological advances expected over the next five years; (3) anticipated shifts in the roles and required skill sets of software professionals; and (4) the contribution of GENIUS in realizing this transformation through practical tools and industrial validation.

Differences in maintenance overhead, reliability, and integration depth with code-hosting platforms make migration between CI platforms a common practice. A central step in migration is translating CI configurations, which is challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of CI configurations and the need to understand semantic differences and relationships across CI platforms. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), recent advances in software engineering highlight their potential for CI configuration translation. In this paper, we present a study on LLM-based CI configuration translation, focusing on the migration from Travis CI to GitHub Actions. First, using 811 migration records, we quantify the effort involved and find that developers read an average of 38 lines of Travis configuration and write 58 lines of GitHub Actions configuration, with nearly half of the migrations requiring multiple commits. We further analyze translations produced by each of the four LLMs and identify 1,121 issues grouped into four categories: logic inconsistencies (38%), platform discrepancies (32%), environment errors (25%), and syntax errors (5%). Finally, we evaluate three enhancement strategies and show that combining guideline-based prompting with iterative refinement achieves the best performance, reaching a Build Success Rate of 75.5%-nearly a threefold improvement over GPT-4o with a basic prompt.</p></details> |  |

Identifying vulnerable functions in target binaries alone is insufficient; it is also crucial to determine whether these functions have been patched. Existing methods, however, suffer from limited usability and accuracy. They often depend on the compilation process to extract features, requiring substantial manual effort and failing for certain software. Moreover, they cannot reliably differentiate between code changes caused by patches or compilation variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lares, a scalable and accurate method for patch presence testing. Lares introduces Code Slice Semantic Search, which directly extracts features from the patch source code and identifies semantically equivalent code slices in the pseudocode of the target binary. By eliminating the need for the compilation process, Lares improves usability, while leveraging large language models (LLMs) for code analysis and SMT solvers for logical reasoning to enhance accuracy. Experimental results show that Lares achieves superior precision, recall, and usability. Furthermore, it is the first work to evaluate patch presence testing across optimization levels, architectures, and compilers. The datasets and source code used in this article are available at https://github.com/Siyuan-Li201/Lares.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in AI-based BFSD tools have led to significant performance improvements. However, existing evaluations of these tools suffer from three key limitations: a lack of in-depth analysis of performance-influencing factors, an absence of realistic application analysis, and reliance on small-scale or low-quality datasets. In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of AI-based BFSD tools to address these gaps. We construct two high-quality and diverse datasets: BinAtlas, comprising 12,453 binaries and over 7 million functions for capability evaluation; and BinAres, containing 12,291 binaries and 54 real-world 1-day vulnerabilities for evaluating vulnerability detection performance in practical IoT firmware settings. Using these datasets, we evaluate nine representative BFSD tools, analyze the challenges and limitations of existing BFSD tools, and investigate the consistency among BFSD tools. We also propose an actionable strategy for combining BFSD tools to enhance overall performance (an improvement of 13.4%). Our study not only advances the practical adoption of BFSD tools but also provides valuable resources and insights to guide future research in scalable and automated binary similarity detection.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |

Existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in code clone detection. However, two crucial issues remain unaddressed: the ability of LLMs to achieve comparable performance across different datasets and the consistency of LLMs' responses in code clone detection. To address these issues, we constructed seven code clone datasets and then evaluated five LLMs in four existing prompts with these datasets. The datasets were created by sampling code pairs using their Levenshtein ratio from two different code collections, CodeNet and BigCloneBench. Our evaluation revealed that although LLMs perform well in CodeNet-related datasets, with o3-mini achieving a 0.943 F1 score, their performance significantly decreased in BigCloneBench-related datasets. Most models achieved a high response consistency, with over 90\% of judgments remaining consistent across all five submissions.

However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g., from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack of transparency in data collection. To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables auditors to verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants, RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection, RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect model behavior difference on trained data. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark significantly enhances data efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files. Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over 90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard the rights of code authors.</p></details> |  |

One promising yet underexplored direction is microservice remediation, where the goal is to automatically recover faulty microservice systems. Existing approaches, however, still rely on human-crafted prompts from Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), with LLMs merely converting textual instructions into executable code. To advance research in this area, we introduce MicroRemed, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in end-to-end microservice remediation, where models must directly generate executable Ansible playbooks from diagnosis reports to restore system functionality. We further propose ThinkRemed, a multi-agent framework that emulates the reflective and perceptive reasoning of SREs. Experimental results show that MicroRemed presents substantial challenges to current LLMs, while ThinkRemed improves end-to-end remediation performance through iterative reasoning and system reflection. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/LLM4AIOps/MicroRemed.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Although straightforward, these methods have limited diversity in generated tests and cannot provide enough debugging information. We propose HarnessLLM, a two-stage training pipeline that enables LLMs to write harness code for testing. Particularly, LLMs generate code that synthesizes inputs and validates the observed outputs, allowing complex test cases and flexible output validation such as invariant checking. To achieve this, we train LLMs with SFT followed by RLVR with a customized reward design. Experiments show that HarnessLLM outperforms input-output-based testing in bug finding and testing strategy diversity. HarnessLLM further benefits the code generation performance through test-time scaling with our generated test cases as inference-phase validation. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/HarnessLLM.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAFixAgent: History-Aware Automated Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01047v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has recently shifted toward large language models and agent-based systems, yet most systems rely on local snapshot context, overlooking repository history. Prior work shows that repository history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DPO-F+: Aligning Code Repair Feedback with Developers' Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01043v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering tasks, especially code repair. However, developers often struggle to interpret model outputs, limiting effective human-AI teaming. Prior work largely optimizes repaired code while under-addressing the natural-language feedback that enables comprehension and iterative improvement. We present DPO-f+, a novel framework that aligns code-repair feedback with developer needs and profiles. It (1) formalizes developer-profiled, domain-specific metrics for feedback alignment; (2) automatically constructs pairwise preference datasets from code-repair tasks; (3) fine-tunes using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) augmented with a lightweight margin signal; and (4) provides an automated feedback evaluation protocol. Empirically, DPO-f+ outperforms both the baseline and standard DPO on generated-code accuracy and overall feedback alignment. On novice programming tasks, DPO-f+ raises the top-1 pass rate by 5.71 percentage points (pp) over the baseline and by 3.30 pp over DPO. On the more challenging SWE-bench Lite benchmark, it increases the issue-resolution rate by 1.67 pp over DPO and by 4.67 pp over the baseline. It also achieves the largest improvement in feedback alignment, outperforming DPO and the baseline. By aligning feedback more closely with developer needs, DPO-f+ turns LLM-assisted repair from one-shot outputs into a collaborative sensemaking workflow, providing a practical approach to enhancing code comprehension and fostering more effective human-AI teaming in software engineering.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Why Attention Fails: A Taxonomy of Faults in Attention-Based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04925v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96 projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Derivations from an Evolving Test Suite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00915v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper presents a longitudinal empirical analysis of the automated, continuous, and virtualization-based software test suite of the NetBSD operating system. The longitudinal period observed spans from the initial roll out of the test suite in the early 2010s to late 2025. According to the results, the test suite has grown continuously, currently covering over ten thousand individual test cases. Failed test cases exhibit overall stability, although there have been shorter periods marked with more frequent failures. A similar observation applies to build failures, failures of the test suite to complete, and installation failures, all of which are also captured by the NetBSD's testing framework. Finally, code churn and kernel modifications do not provide longitudinally consistent statistical explanations for the failures. Although some periods exhibit larger effects, including particularly with respect to the kernel modifications, the effects are small on average. Even though only in an exploratory manner, these empirical observations contribute to efforts to draw conclusions from large-scale and evolving software test suites.</p></details> | Submitted |
| **[Sustainability of Machine Learning-Enabled Systems: The Machine Learning Practitioner's Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00901v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software sustainability is a key multifaceted non-functional requirement that encompasses environmental, social, and economic concerns, yet its integration into the development of Machine Learning (ML)-enabled systems remains an open challenge. While previous research has explored high-level sustainability principles and policy recommendations, limited empirical evidence exists on how sustainability is practically managed in ML workflows. Existing studies predominantly focus on environmental sustainability, e.g., carbon footprint reduction, while missing the broader spectrum of sustainability dimensions and the challenges practitioners face in real-world settings. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study to characterize sustainability in ML-enabled systems from a practitioner's perspective. We investigate (1) how ML engineers perceive and describe sustainability, (2) the software engineering practices they adopt to support it, and (3) the key challenges hindering its adoption. We first perform a qualitative analysis based on interviews with eight experienced ML engineers, followed by a large-scale quantitative survey with 203 ML practitioners. Our key findings reveal a significant disconnection between sustainability awareness and its systematic implementation, highlighting the need for more structured guidelines, measurement frameworks, and regulatory support.</p></details> |  |
| **[PredicateFix: Repairing Static Analysis Alerts with Bridging Predicates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12205v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fixing static analysis alerts in source code with Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly popular. However, LLMs often hallucinate and perform poorly for complex and less common alerts. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to solve this problem by providing the model with a relevant example, but existing approaches face the challenge of unsatisfactory quality of such examples. To address this challenge, we utilize the predicates in the analysis rule, which serve as a bridge between the alert and relevant code snippets within a clean code corpus, called key examples. Based on this insight, we propose an algorithm to retrieve key examples for an alert automatically, and build PredicateFix as a RAG pipeline to fix alerts from two static code analyzers: CodeQL and GoInsight. Evaluation with multiple LLMs shows that PredicateFix increases the number of correct repairs by 27.1% ~ 69.3%, significantly outperforming other baseline RAG approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures; accepted for ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation of Agent Frameworks on Code-centric Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00872v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike traditional automation tools or static LLM-based systems, agents combine decision-making and tool utilization to accomplish complex tasks, showing great potential in software engineering. However, existing studies largely focus on specific tasks or isolated aspects, providing an incomplete picture of agents' practical capabilities. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating seven general-purpose agent frameworks across three representative code-centric tasks: software development, vulnerability detection, and program repair. Each task is assessed using standard, widely adopted benchmarks to ensure objective and comparable evaluation. Agent performance is systematically analyzed from three complementary perspectives: effectiveness (task success), efficiency (execution process), and overhead (token consumption). Our findings reveal distinct capability patterns and trade-offs among the evaluated frameworks. In terms of effectiveness, agents achieve moderate overall performance. Regarding efficiency, AgentOrchestra tends to exhibit the longest trajectories and the most correction attempts due to coordination overhead, whereas OpenHands demonstrate stronger reflective reasoning abilities. For overhead, software development incurs the highest monetary cost, while GPTswarm remains the most cost-efficient. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth cross-analysis of the relationship between effectiveness and efficiency, exploring the underlying reasons behind their interplay. These findings guide both practical adoption and future research toward more efficient software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeClash: Benchmarking Goal-Oriented Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00839v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current benchmarks for coding evaluate language models (LMs) on concrete, well-specified tasks such as fixing specific bugs or writing targeted tests. However, human programmers do not spend all day incessantly addressing isolated tasks. Instead, real-world software development is grounded in the pursuit of high-level goals, like improving user retention or reducing costs. Evaluating whether LMs can also iteratively develop code to better accomplish open-ended objectives without any explicit guidance remains an open challenge. To address this, we introduce CodeClash, a benchmark where LMs compete in multi-round tournaments to build the best codebase for achieving a competitive objective. Each round proceeds in two phases: agents edit their code, then their codebases compete head-to-head in a code arena that determines winners based on objectives like score maximization, resource acquisition, or survival. Whether it's writing notes, scrutinizing documentation, analyzing competition logs, or creating test suites, models must decide for themselves how to improve their codebases both absolutely and against their opponents. We run 1680 tournaments (25,200 rounds total) to evaluate 8 LMs across 6 arenas. Our results reveal that while models exhibit diverse development styles, they share fundamental limitations in strategic reasoning. Models also struggle with long-term codebase maintenance, as repositories become progressively messy and redundant. These limitations are stark: top models lose every round against expert human programmers. We open-source CodeClash to advance the study of autonomous, goal-oriented code development.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of Bitcoin cross-chain bridge protocols, systematically analyzing their trust assumptions, performance characteristics, and applicability to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) scenarios. We categorize bridge designs into three main types: naive token swapping, pegged-asset bridges, and arbitrary-message bridges. Each category is evaluated across key metrics such as trust model, latency, capital efficiency, and DeFi composability. Emerging innovations like BitVM and recursive sidechains are highlighted for their potential to enable secure, scalable, and programmable Bitcoin interoperability. Furthermore, we explore practical use cases of cross-chain bridges in AIoT applications, including decentralized energy trading, healthcare data integration, and supply chain automation. This taxonomy provides a foundational framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to design secure and efficient cross-chain infrastructures in AIoT systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Block...</summary><p>Blockchain Cross-Chain Bridge Survey</p></details> |

However, deploying such experiments requires substantial resources, may negatively impact users, and involves long data collection periods. To address this, \textit{off-policy evaluation (OPE)}, or offline A/B testing, uses logged data to assess technologies and is fundamental in Reinforcement Learning, making it crucial in domains where online testing is costly or risky, such as healthcare, recommender systems, education, dialog systems, and robotics. Despite advances in coding LLMs and agentic AI, little is known about leveraging them to optimize OPE results. We investigate whether LLMs and LLM-based agents can improve OPE performance via code optimization. We propose \textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on large-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates results, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established protocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP)~\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and Scope-RL~\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \textit{two_agent} framework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization effectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability and the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both two_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated "growth hackers" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling data-driven decision-making in production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Language Models Go Beyond Coding? Assessing the Capability of Language Models to Build Real-World Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00780v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in software engineering, yet few benchmarks evaluate their ability to repair software during migration across instruction set architectures (ISAs). Cross-ISA migration, such as between x86_64 and aarch64, requires handling complex dependencies, heterogeneous toolchains, and long build logs while ensuring executable verification. To address this challenge, we present Build-bench, an end-to-end benchmark that systematically evaluates the capability of LLMs to repair build failures in cross-ISA settings. Build-bench collects 268 real-world failed packages and integrates auxiliary tools including Structure Extraction, File Content Extraction, Content Modification, and Build Verification to support autonomous, tool-augmented reasoning. The repair process operates in an iterative loop where, upon failure, the model receives updated build logs and previous repair outcomes to refine subsequent attempts. Through a comparative evaluation of six representative LLMs, Build-bench reveals that current models achieve a maximum build success rate of 63% and tool usage patterns differ significantly across models. By coupling real build environments with verifiable outcomes, Build-bench establishes the first architecture-aware benchmark for studying LLM-based software build and repair.</p></details> |  |

As LLMs become increasingly integrated into software engineering tasks, understanding and mitigating hallucination in code becomes essential. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of hallucination phenomena in code-oriented LLMs from four key perspectives. First, we begin by surveying 60 papers to define hallucination in the context of code and summarize its primary causes, such as data noise, exposure bias, and insufficient semantic grounding, while also tracing recent trends in literature across natural language processing (NLP) and software engineering communities. Second, we review model hallucination surveys in a broader span and summarize representative hallucination mitigation strategies, such as knowledge-enhanced generation, constrained decoding, and post-editing. Third, we review approaches targeted for code intelligence and highlight code-specific challenges that aggravate hallucination, including syntax sensitivity, strict type systems, and dependence on external libraries. Meanwhile, we analyze how emerging code intelligence tasks, e.g., program analysis, symbolic execution, and unit testing, are utilized to detect and mitigate hallucinations. Fourth, we summarize current evaluation benchmarks, ranging from static metrics to dynamic checks, e.g., compilation and execution correctness, and emphasize the need for hallucination-oriented benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoScope: Leveraging Call Chain-Aware Multi-View Context for Repository-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14791v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code generation aims to generate code within the context of a specified repository. Existing approaches typically employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to provide LLMs with relevant contextual information extracted from the repository. However, these approaches often struggle with effectively identifying truly relevant contexts that capture the rich semantics of the repository, and their contextual perspectives remains narrow. Moreover, most approaches fail to account for the structural relationships in the retrieved code during prompt construction, hindering the LLM's ability to accurately interpret the context. To address these issues, we propose RepoScope, which leverages call chain-aware multi-view context for repository-level code generation. RepoScope constructs a Repository Structural Semantic Graph (RSSG) and retrieves a comprehensive four-view context, integrating both structural and similarity-based contexts. We propose a novel call chain prediction method that utilizes the repository's structural semantics to improve the identification of callees in the target function. Additionally, we present a structure-preserving serialization algorithm for prompt construction, ensuring the coherence of the context for the LLM. Notably, RepoScope relies solely on static analysis, eliminating the need for additional training or multiple LLM queries, thus ensuring both efficiency and generalizability. Evaluation on widely-used repository-level code generation benchmarks (CoderEval and DevEval) demonstrates that RepoScope outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 36.35% relative improvement in pass@1 scores. Further experiments emphasize RepoScope's potential to improve code generation across different tasks and its ability to integrate effectively with existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Autoregression: An Empirical Study of Diffusion Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11252v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have become the mainstream approaches to code generation. Existing LLMs mainly employ autoregressive generation, i.e. generating code token-by-token from left to right. However, the underlying autoregressive generation has two limitations in code generation. First, autoregressive LLMs only generate a token at each step, showing low efficiency in practice. Second, programming is a non-sequential process involving back-and-forth editing, while autoregressive LLMs only employ the left-to-right generation order. These two intrinsic limitations hinder the further development of LLMs in code generation. Recently, diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative. Diffusion LLMs address the above limitations with two advances, including multi-token prediction (i.e. generating multiple tokens at each step) and flexible generation order (i.e. flexibly determining which positions to generate tokens). However, there is no systematic study exploring diffusion LLMs in code generation. To bridge the knowledge gap, we present the first empirical study of diffusion LLMs for code generation. Our study involves 9 representative diffusion LLMs and conduct experiments on 4 widely used benchmarks. Based on the results, we summarize the following findings. (1) Existing diffusion LLMs are competitive with autoregressive LLMs with similar sizes. (2) Diffusion LLMs have a stronger length extrapolation ability than autoregressive LLMs and perform better in long code understanding. (3) We explore factors impacting the effectiveness and efficiency of diffusion LLMs, and provide practical guidance. (4) We discuss several promising further directions to improve diffusion LLMs on code generation. We open-source all source code, data, and results to facilitate the following research. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/dllm4code.</p></details> |  |

In adults, dyslexia can affect both professional and personal lives, often leading to mental challenges and difficulties acquiring and keeping work. In Software Engineering (SE), reading and writing difficulties appear to pose substantial challenges for core tasks such as programming. However, initial studies indicate that these challenges may not significantly affect their performance compared to non-dyslexic colleagues. Conversely, strengths associated with dyslexia could be particularly valuable in areas like programming and design. However, there is currently no work that explores the experiences of dyslexic software engineers, and puts their strengths into relation with their difficulties. To address this, we present a qualitative study of the experiences of dyslexic individuals in SE. We followed the basic stage of the Socio-Technical Grounded Theory method and base our findings on data collected through 10 interviews with dyslexic software engineers, 3 blog posts and 153 posts on the social media platform Reddit. We find that dyslexic software engineers especially struggle at the programming learning stage, but can succeed and indeed excel at many SE tasks once they master this step. Common SE-specific support tools, such as code completion and linters are especially useful to these individuals and mitigate many of the experienced difficulties. Finally, dyslexic software engineers exhibit strengths in areas such as visual thinking and creativity. Our findings have implications to SE practice and motivate several areas of future research in SE, such as investigating what makes code less/more understandable to dyslexic individuals.</p></details> |  |

Manually repairing these RLFs involves tedious trial-and-error adjustments of HTML elements and CSS properties. In this study, an automated repair approach, leveraging LLM combined with domain-specific knowledge is proposed. The approach is named ReDeFix, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based solution that utilizes Stack Overflow (SO) discussions to guide LLM on CSS repairs. By augmenting relevant SO knowledge with RLF-specific contexts, ReDeFix creates a prompt that is sent to the LLM to generate CSS patches. Evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves an 88\% accuracy in repairing RLFs. Furthermore, a study from software engineers reveals that generated repairs produce visually correct layouts while maintaining aesthetics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025 (ICSME'25)</p></details> |

Software Engineering (SE) is no exception and stands to benefit from these new technologies, enhancing productivity and quality in its software development processes. However, although the use of Generative AI in SE practices is still in its early stages, considering the lack of conclusive results from ongoing research and the limited technological maturity, we have chosen to incorporate these technologies in the development of a web-based software system to be used in clinical trials by a thoracic diseases research group at our university. For this reason, we decided to share this experience report documenting our development team's learning journey in using Generative AI during the software development process. Project management, requirements specification, design, development, and quality assurance activities form the scope of observation.

However, many current MAS frameworks struggle with reliability and scalability, especially on complex tasks. We present AgentGit, a framework that brings Git-like rollback and branching to MAS workflows. Built as an infrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit, revert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore multiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an experiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts. We ran a multi-step A/B test against three baselines -- LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno -- on a real-world task: retrieving and analyzing paper abstracts. Results show that AgentGit significantly reduces redundant computation, lowers runtime and token usage, and supports parallel exploration across multiple branches, enhancing both reliability and scalability in MAS development. This work offers a practical path to more robust MAS design and enables error recovery, safe exploration, iterative debugging, and A/B testing in collaborative AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Detect Real-World Android Software Compliance Violations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00624v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed software engineering, showing promise in tasks like code generation, bug detection, and compliance checking. However, current models struggle to detect compliance violations in Android applications across diverse legal frameworks. We propose \emph{CompliBench}, a novel evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' ability to detect compliance violations under regulations like LGPD, PDPA, and PIPEDA. The framework defines two tasks: Task 1 evaluates \emph{retrieval and localization} at file, module, and line granularities, and Task 2 assesses \emph{multi-label judgment} for code snippets. These tasks mirror the audit process, where auditors locate problematic code and determine implicated provisions. Traditional metrics fail to capture important aspects like cross-granularity stability and jurisdictional consistency. Thus, we introduce stability-aware composites (SGS, RCS, CRGS, and OCS) for a more comprehensive assessment. Experiments with six models, including GPT-4O and Claude-3.5, show \emph{CompliBench} improves compliance detection, with Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 achieving the highest OCS score (0.3295), and Gemini-2.5-pro the lowest (0.0538). This work demonstrates \emph{CompliBench}'s potential for improving LLM performance in compliance tasks and provides a foundation for future tools aligned with data protection standards.

We introduce \textbf{GDPR-Bench-Android}, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating diverse automated methods for GDPR compliance detection in Android applications. It contains \textbf{1951} manually annotated violation instances from \textbf{15} open-source repositories, covering 23 GDPR articles at file-, module-, and line-level granularities. To enable a multi-paradigm evaluation, we contribute \textbf{Formal-AST}, a novel, source-code-native formal method that serves as a deterministic baseline. We define two tasks: (1) \emph{multi-granularity violation localization}, evaluated via Accuracy@\textit{k}; and (2) \emph{snippet-level multi-label classification}, assessed by macro-F1 and other classification metrics. We benchmark 11 methods, including eight state-of-the-art LLMs, our Formal-AST analyzer, a retrieval-augmented (RAG) method, and an agentic (ReAct) method. Our findings reveal that no single paradigm excels across all tasks. For Task 1, the ReAct agent achieves the highest file-level Accuracy@1 (17.38%), while the Qwen2.5-72B LLM leads at the line level (61.60%), in stark contrast to the Formal-AST method's 1.86%. For the difficult multi-label Task 2, the Claude-Sonnet-4.5 LLM achieves the best Macro-F1 (5.75%), while the RAG method yields the highest Macro-Precision (7.10%). These results highlight the task-dependent strengths of different automated approaches and underscore the value of our benchmark in diagnosing their capabilities.

| **[Employee Performance when Implementing Agile Practices in an IT Workforce](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00528v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adoption of agile practices has increased in IT workforces. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies in the African context on employee performance when implementing agile practices. This study addresses this gap by exploring employee performance in agile environments for IT workforces in South Africa. An interpretivist mono-method qualitative approach was used, with the use of interviews as a research strategy. Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with agile practitioners from various roles. Our results indicated that agile practices influence employee performance significantly, with participants reporting on aspects which included planning, communication, employee development and well-being, collaboration, team culture and progress. Additionally, our results reported obstacles when using agile practices that included adoption, team engagement, leadership and instilling an agile mindset. Agile practices influence employee performance in IT workforces by fostering improved team dynamics, enhanced collaboration, improved efficiencies, risk management, planning, continuous improvement, learning, personal development and well-being. Conclusively, our findings suggest that if agile challenges are addressed and additional support is provided, employee performance can be significantly improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, 7th World Symposium on Software Engineering (WSSE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[HIP-LLM: A Hierarchical Imprecise Probability Approach to Reliability Assessment of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00527v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, raising the need for rigorous reliability assessment methods. Existing benchmark-based evaluations primarily offer descriptive statistics of model accuracy over datasets, providing limited insight into the probabilistic behavior of LLMs under real operational conditions. This paper introduces HIP-LLM, a Hierarchical Imprecise Probability framework for modeling and inferring LLM reliability. Building upon the foundations of software reliability engineering, HIP-LLM defines LLM reliability as the probability of failure-free operation over a specified number of future tasks under a given Operational Profile (OP). HIP-LLM represents dependencies across (sub-)domains hierarchically, enabling multi-level inference from subdomain to system-level reliability. HIP-LLM embeds imprecise priors to capture epistemic uncertainty and incorporates OPs to reflect usage contexts. It derives posterior reliability envelopes that quantify uncertainty across priors and data. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIP-LLM offers a more accurate and standardized reliability characterization than existing benchmark and state-of-the-art approaches. A publicly accessible repository of HIP-LLM is provided.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Issue-Oriented Agent-Based Framework for Automated Review Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00517v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review (CR) is a crucial practice for ensuring software quality. Various automated review comment generation techniques have been proposed to streamline the labor-intensive process. However, existing approaches heavily rely on a single model to identify various issues within the code, limiting the model's ability to handle the diverse, issue-specific nature of code changes and leading to non-informative comments, especially in complex scenarios such as bug fixes. To address these limitations, we propose RevAgent, a novel agent-based issue-oriented framework, decomposes the task into three stages: (1) Generation Stage, where five category-specific commentator agents analyze code changes from distinct issue perspectives and generate candidate comments; (2) Discrimination Stage, where a critic agent selects the most appropriate issue-comment pair; and (3) Training Stage, where all agents are fine-tuned on curated, category-specific data to enhance task specialization. Evaluation results show that RevAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PLM- and LLM-based baselines, with improvements of 12.90\%, 10.87\%, 6.32\%, and 8.57\% on BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and SBERT, respectively. It also achieves relatively higher accuracy in issue-category identification, particularly for challenging scenarios. Human evaluations further validate the practicality of RevAgent in generating accurate, readable, and context-aware review comments. Moreover, RevAgent delivers a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Big Step Forward? A User-Centric Examination of iOS App Privacy Report and Enhancements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00467v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalent engagement with mobile apps underscores the importance of understanding their data practices. Transparency plays a crucial role in this context, ensuring users to be informed and give consent before any data access occurs. Apple introduced a new feature since iOS 15.2, App Privacy Report, to inform users about detailed insights into apps' data access and sharing. This feature continues Apple's trend of privacy-focused innovations (following Privacy Nutrition Labels), and has been marketed as a big step forward in user privacy. However, its real-world impacts on user privacy and control remain unexamined. We thus proposed an end-to-end study involving systematic assessment of the App Privacy Report's real-world benefits and limitations, LLM-enabled and multi-technique synthesized enhancements, and comprehensive evaluation from both system and user perspectives. Through a structured focus group study with twelve everyday iOS users, we explored their experiences, understanding, and perceptions of the feature, suggesting its limited practical impact resulting from missing important details. We identified two primary user concerns: the clarity of data access purpose and domain description. In response, we proposed enhancements including a purpose inference framework and domain clarification pipeline. We demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits of such enhancements for mobile app users. This work provides practical insights that could help enhance user privacy transparency and discusses areas for future research.</p></details> | Accepted to S&P 2025 |
| **[SmartDoc: A Context-Aware Agentic Method Comment Generation Plugin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00450v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The software maintenance phase involves many activities such as code refactoring, bug fixing, code review or testing. Program comprehension is key to all these activities, as it demands developers to grasp the knowledge (e.g., implementation details) required to modify the codebase. Methods as main building blocks in a program can offer developers this knowledge source for code comprehension. However, reading entire method statements can be challenging, which necessitates precise and up-to-date comments. Objective: We propose a solution as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin, named SmartDoc, that assists developers in generating context-aware method comments. Method: This plugin acts as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that has its own memory and is augmented by target methods' context. When a request is initiated by the end-user, the method content and all its nested method calls are used in the comment generation. At the beginning, these nested methods are visited and a call graph is generated. This graph is then traversed using depth-first search (DFS), enabling the provision of full-context to enrich Large Language Model (LLM) prompts. Result: The product is a software, as a plugin, developed for Java codebase and installable on IntelliJ IDEA. This plugin can serve concurrently for methods whose comments are being updated , and it shares memory across all flows to avoid redundant calls. o measure the accuracy of this solution, a dedicated test case is run to record SmartDoc generated comments and their corresponding ground truth. For each collected result-set, three metrics are computed, BERTScore, BLEU and ROUGE-1. These metrics will determine how accurate the generated comments are in comparison to the ground truth. Result: The obtained accuracy, in terms of the precision, recall and F1, is promising, and lies in the range of 0.80 to 0.90 for BERTScore.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Already submitted to The 3rd International Workshop on Integrated Development Environments (the IDE Workshop)</p></details> |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> | Accepted at ASE 2025 |

This dissertation optimizes human-AI programming roles through self-determination theory and personality psychology, introducing the Role Optimization Motivation Alignment (ROMA) framework. Through Design Science Research spanning five cycles, this work establishes empirically-validated connections between personality traits, programming role preferences, and collaborative outcomes, engaging 200 experimental participants and 46 interview respondents. Key findings demonstrate that personality-driven role optimization significantly enhances self-determination and team dynamics, yielding 23% average motivation increases among professionals and up to 65% among undergraduates. Five distinct personality archetypes emerge: The Explorer (high Openness/low Agreeableness), The Orchestrator (high Extraversion/Agreeableness), The Craftsperson (high Neuroticism/low Extraversion), The Architect (high Conscientiousness), and The Adapter (balanced profile). Each exhibits distinct preferences for programming roles (Co-Pilot, Co-Navigator, Agent), with assignment modes proving crucial for satisfaction. The dissertation contributes: (1) an empirically-validated framework linking personality traits to role preferences and self-determination outcomes; (2) a taxonomy of AI collaboration modalities mapped to personality profiles while preserving human agency; and (3) an ISO/IEC 29110 extension enabling Very Small Entities to implement personality-driven role optimization within established standards.

| **[Reducing students' misconceptions about video game development. A mixed-method study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00407v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines students' na\"ive mindset (misconceptions) about video game development, idealized and inaccurate beliefs that shape an unrealistic understanding of the field. The research evaluated the effectiveness of a fifteen-hour-long lecture series delivered by industry professionals, designed to challenge this mindset and expose students to the complexities and realities of game production. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining qualitative analysis with a prototype quantitative tool developed to measure levels of misconception. Participants included students (n = 91) from diverse academic backgrounds interested in game creation and professionals (n = 94) working in the video game industry. Findings show that the intervention significantly reduced students' na\"ive beliefs while enhancing their motivation to pursue careers in the industry. Exposure to professional perspectives fostered a more realistic and informed mindset, taking into account the understanding of the technical, collaborative, and business aspects of game development. The results suggest that incorporating similar expert-led interventions early in game development education can improve learning outcomes, support informed career choices, and mitigate future professional disappointment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Trajectories for Socratic Debugging of Student Code: From Misconceptions to Contradictions and Updated Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00371v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Socratic debugging, instructors guide students towards identifying and fixing a bug on their own, instead of providing the bug fix directly. Most novice programmer bugs are caused by programming misconceptions, namely false beliefs about a programming concept. In this context, Socratic debugging can be formulated as a guided Reasoning Trajectory (RT) leading to a statement about the program behavior that contradicts the bug-causing misconception. Upon reaching this statement, the ensuing cognitive dissonance leads the student to first identify and then update their false belief. In this paper, we introduce the task of reasoning trajectory generation, together with a dataset of debugging problems manually annotated with RTs. We then describe LLM-based solutions for generating RTs and Socratic conversations that are anchored on them. A large-scale LLM-as-judge evaluation shows that frontier models can generate up to 91% correct reasoning trajectories and 98.7% valid conversation turns.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 tables, 13 figures</p></details> |

However, such workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct output at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages, compounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating verifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate, or LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant latency and cost overheads. In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a workflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to select the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification with minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using counterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and selectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime, Sherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead, while verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is rolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying baseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across benchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over non-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the Monte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware verification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven Cost-Effective Requirements Change Impact Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00262v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements are inherently subject to changes throughout the software development lifecycle. Within the limited budget available to requirements engineers, manually identifying the impact of such changes on other requirements is both error-prone and effort-intensive. That might lead to overlooked impacted requirements, which, if not properly managed, can cause serious issues in the downstream tasks. Inspired by the growing potential of large language models (LLMs) across diverse domains, we propose ProReFiCIA, an LLM-driven approach for automatically identifying the impacted requirements when changes occur. We conduct an extensive evaluation of ProReFiCIA using several LLMs and prompts variants tailored to this task. Using the best combination of an LLM and a prompt variant, ProReFiCIA achieves a recall of 93.3% on a benchmark dataset and 95.8% on a newly created industry dataset, demonstrating its strong effectiveness in identifying impacted requirements. Further, the cost of applying ProReFiCIA remains small, as the engineer only needs to review the generated results, which represent between 2.1% and 8.5% of the entire set of requirements.</p></details> | 28 pages, 6 figures |

This paper introduces DocPrism, a multi-language, code-documentation inconsistency detection tool. DocPrism uses a standard large language model (LLM) to analyze and explain inconsistencies. Plain use of LLMs for this task yield unacceptably high false positive rates: LLMs identify natural gaps between high-level documentation and detailed code implementations as inconsistencies. We introduce and apply the Local Categorization, External Filtering (LCEF) methodology to reduce false positives. LCEF relies on the LLM's local completion skills rather than its long-term reasoning skills. In our ablation study, LCEF reduces DocPrism's inconsistency flag rate from 98% to 14%, and increases accuracy from 14% to 94%. On a broad evaluation across Python, TypeScript, C++, and Java, DocPrism maintains a low flag rate of 15%, and achieves a precision of 0.62 without performing any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, developers report key limitations including the accumulation of technical debt, security issues, and code churn to achieve satisfactory results. We argue that these pitfalls result from LLMs' inability to reconcile accumulating human-imposed constraints during vibe coding, with developers inadvertently failing to resolve contradictions because LLMs prioritize user commands over code consistency. Given LLMs' receptiveness to verification-based feedback, we argue that formal methods can mitigate these pitfalls, making vibe coding more reliable. However, we posit that integrating formal methods must transcend existing approaches that combine formal methods and LLMs. We advocate for a side-car system throughout the vibe coding process which: (1) \emph{Autoformalizes} specifications (2) Validates against targets, (3) Delivers \emph{actionable} feedback to the LLM, and (4) Allows intuitive developer influence on specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, In Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Language Models and Programming Languages (LMPL'25), October 12-18, 2025, Singapore, Singapore.

| **[Understanding Code Agent Behaviour: An Empirical Study of Success and Failure Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00197v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for complex software engineering tasks has created a need to understand their problem-solving behaviours beyond simple success metrics. While these agents demonstrate impressive capabilities in automated issue resolution, their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. This paper presents an empirical study of agent trajectories, namely the execution traces capturing the steps agents take when attempting to resolve software issues. We analyse trajectories from three state-of-the-art code agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and Prometheus) on the SWE-Bench benchmark, examining both successful and failed attempts. Our investigation reveals several key insights into agent behaviour. First, we identify how distinct problem-solving strategies, such as defensive programming and context gathering, enable success in different scenarios. Second, we find that failed trajectories are consistently longer and exhibit higher variance than successful ones, with failure patterns differing significantly between agents. Third, our fault localisation analysis shows that while most trajectories correctly identify problematic files (72-81\% even in failures), success depends more on achieving approximate rather than exact code modifications. These and other findings unveiled by our study, provide a foundation for understanding agent behaviour through trajectory analysis, contributing to the development of more robust and interpretable autonomous software engineering systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code migration, specifically the problem of maintaining compatibility with a dependency as it undergoes major and minor semantic version changes. We demonstrate, using metrics such as test coverage and change comparisons, that contexts containing diffs can significantly improve performance against out of the box LLMs and, in some cases, perform better than using code. We provide a dataset to assist in further development of this problem area, as well as an open-source Python package, AIMigrate, that can be used to assist with migrating code bases. In a real-world migration of TYPHOIDSIM between STARSIM versions, AIMigrate correctly identified 65% of required changes in a single run, increasing to 80% with multiple runs, with 47% of changes generated perfectly.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

However, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging task for LLMs. An effective way to improve LLM performance is in-context learning (ICL) - providing few-shot examples similar to the query, along with correct answers, can improve an LLM's ability to generate correct solutions. However, choosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model performance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot examples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first criterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a sample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about its usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity of the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples based on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations to determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under various combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, this integration introduces significant challenges for software engineering, especially in software product lines (SPLs), where managing variability and reuse becomes more complex with the inclusion of ML components. Although existing approaches have addressed variability management in SPLs and the integration of ML components in isolated systems, few have explored the intersection of both domains. Specifically, there is limited support for modeling and managing variability in SPLs that incorporate ML components. To bridge this gap, this article proposes a structured framework designed to extend Software Product Line engineering, facilitating the integration of ML components. It facilitates the design of SPLs with ML capabilities by enabling systematic modeling of variability and reuse. The proposal has been partially implemented with the VariaMos tool.</p></details> | pp. 73-94, 2 figures |

| **[From Code Changes to Quality Gains: An Empirical Study in Python ML Systems with PyQu](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02827v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS), software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners, educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering</p></details> |

In this work, we formalize the phenomenon of continuous or near-continuous regression testing using successive builds as a time-ordered chain, where each build contains the program, requirements, and the accompanying tests. We also formalize the regression test window between any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for the classical two-version case. The formalization is validated by directly representing two state-of-the-art agile regression testing algorithms in terms of build-tuple operations without requiring auxiliary assumptions, followed by proof of the soundness and completeness of our formalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the first attempt to formalize regression testing in agile context as a continuous/near-continuos activity.

Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</p></details> | Under review |

Although recent advances in language models further enhance this process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and (3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs.

These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 291 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |

However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nebius/SWE-rebench, SWE-rebench leaderboard https://swe-rebench.com NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Although RE is fundamental to software engineering, limited research has examined AI adoption in RE. We surveyed 55 software practitioners to map AI usage across four RE phases: Elicitation, Analysis, Specification, and Validation, and four approaches for decision making: human-only decisions, AI validation, Human AI Collaboration (HAIC), and full AI automation. Participants also shared their perceptions, challenges, and opportunities when applying AI for RE tasks. Our data show that 58.2% of respondents already use AI in RE, and 69.1% view its impact as positive or very positive.HAIC dominates practice, accounting for 54.4% of all RE techniques, while full AI automation remains minimal at 5.4%. Passive AI validation (4.4 to 6.2%) lags even further behind, indicating that practitioners value AI's active support over passive oversight. These findings suggest that AI is most effective when positioned as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human expertise. It also highlights the need for RE-specific HAIC frameworks along with robust and responsible AI governance as AI adoption in RE grows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Intelligent Software Engineering (ISE) 2025 Workshop at the Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

However, fully adopting CSE is often constrained by complex products, legacy systems, organizational inertia, and regulatory requirements. In this paper, we examine four industrial cases from the automation, automotive, retail, and chemical sectors to explore how such constraints shape CSE adoption in practice. Methods: We apply and extend a previously proposed CSE Industry Readiness Model to assess the current and potential levels of adoption in each case. Through expert interviews and narrative synthesis, we identify common driving forces and adoption barriers, including organizational preparedness, cross-organizational dependencies, and limited customer demand for continuous delivery. Results: Based on our findings, we propose an updated readiness model that introduces additional levels of internal and external feedback, distinguishes market- and organization-facing constraints, and better guides practitioners in setting realistic CSE adoption goals. Conclusions: Our results highlight that while full end-to-end CSE adoption may not always be feasible, meaningful internal improvements are still possible and beneficial. This study provides empirically grounded guidance for organizations navigating partial or constrained CSE transformations.</p></details> |  |

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

LLM-assisted Software Traceability with Architecture Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02434v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying architecturally relevant entities in textual artifacts is crucial for Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) between Software Architecture Documentation (SAD) and source code. While Software Architecture Models (SAMs) can bridge the semantic gap between these artifacts, their manual creation is time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new capabilities for extracting architectural entities from SAD and source code to construct SAMs automatically or establish direct trace links. This paper presents two LLM-based approaches: ExArch extracts component names as simple SAMs from SAD and source code to eliminate the need for manual SAM creation, while ArTEMiS identifies architectural entities in documentation and matches them with (manually or automatically generated) SAM entities. Our evaluation compares against state-of-the-art approaches SWATTR, TransArC and ArDoCode. TransArC achieves strong performance (F1: 0.87) but requires manually created SAMs; ExArch achieves comparable results (F1: 0.86) using only SAD and code. ArTEMiS is on par with the traditional heuristic-based SWATTR (F1: 0.81) and can successfully replace it when integrated with TransArC. The combination of ArTEMiS and ExArch outperforms ArDoCode, the best baseline without manual SAMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively identify architectural entities in textual artifacts, enabling automated SAM generation and TLR, making architecture-code traceability more practical and accessible.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines, which oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by 16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for complex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing iterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of base LLMs to better support iterative software development.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

They can be used in the specification of autonomous driving, avionics, air traffic control, and similar systems. They aim to reduce risks of harm of all kinds including human mortality, environmental damage, and financial loss. However, assurance cases often tend to be organized as extensive documents spanning hundreds of pages, making their creation, review, and maintenance error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious. Therefore, there is a growing need to leverage (semi-)automated techniques, such as those powered by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), to enhance efficiency, consistency, and accuracy across the entire assurance-case lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on assurance case review, a critical task that ensures the quality of assurance cases and therefore fosters their acceptance by regulatory authorities. We propose a novel approach that leverages the \textit{LLM-as-a-judge} paradigm to automate the review process. Specifically, we propose new predicate-based rules that formalize well-established assurance case review criteria, allowing us to craft LLM prompts tailored to the review task. Our experiments on several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) show that, while most LLMs yield relatively good review capabilities, DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 demonstrate superior performance, with DeepSeek-R1 ultimately outperforming GPT-4.1. However, our experimental results also suggest that human reviewers are still needed to refine the reviews LLMs yield.</p></details> |  |

The versatile nature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the performance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown that they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these faulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs. One obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which necessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors. Metamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this oracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define relationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty behaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This paper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We conducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We implemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments with three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests. The results shed light on the capabilities and opportunities of MT for LLMs, as well as its limitations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering - transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in language models further enhance this process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and (3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs. Both automated and human evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while still struggling on diff2sum. These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting from long code diffs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on self-consistency or simulation feedback to select the best candidate, but they miss opportunities to focus LLM reasoning on the most informative parts of the design. We propose VFocus, a three-stage framework that enhances Verilog generation by sharpening the focus of LLM reasoning onto critical decision points in the code generation process. In the \textbf{pre-ranking stage}, VFocus generates multiple code candidates through LLM prompting, retries for syntactically valid outputs, and introduces a \textit{Density-guided Filtering} to retain candidates that fall within the "reasoning sweet spot" for functional correctness. In the \textbf{ranking stage}, we simulate each code candidate using an automatically generated testbench and apply self-consistency-based clustering to identify the most consistent outputs. Finally, in the \textbf{post-ranking refinement stage}, VFocus performs inconsistency mining on top-ranked candidates and invokes reasoning-augmented LLM prompts for candidate refinement. Experiments on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark show that VFocus significantly improves the pass@1 correctness across multiple reasoning LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing Verilog generation for complex hardware design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by SOCC 2025</p></details> |

Confidence estimation serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects. This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to $0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$ over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence mechanisms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

As these systems grow in complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score.

| **[From Code Changes to Quality Gains: An Empirical Study in Python ML Systems with PyQu](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02827v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS), software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners, educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Formalizing Regression Testing for Agile and Continuous Integration Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02810v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software developed using modern agile practices delivers a stream of software versions that require continuous regression testing rather than testing once close to the delivery or maintenance phase, as assumed by classical regression-testing theory. In this work, we formalize the phenomenon of continuous or near-continuous regression testing using successive builds as a time-ordered chain, where each build contains the program, requirements, and the accompanying tests. We also formalize the regression test window between any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for the classical two-version case. The formalization is validated by directly representing two state-of-the-art agile regression testing algorithms in terms of build-tuple operations without requiring auxiliary assumptions, followed by proof of the soundness and completeness of our formalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the first attempt to formalize regression testing in agile context as a continuous/near-continuos activity. This formalization will help practitioners and researchers to answer 'when', 'what' and 'how much' question of regression testing in real world time constrained agile projects. This work is currently under review with Software Quality Journal</p></details> |
| **[1 PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Investigating the Experience of Autistic Individuals in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02736v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) leads to various issues in the everyday life of autistic individuals, often resulting in unemployment and mental health problems. To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants. We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance. Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReleaseEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in Automated Release Note Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02713v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated release note generation addresses the challenge of documenting frequent software updates, where manual efforts are time-consuming and prone to human error. Although recent advances in language models further enhance this process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and (3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs. Both automated and human evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while still struggling on diff2sum. These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting from long code diffs.</p></details> |  |

FACTS combines real-time atmospheric data collected by IoT sensors with curated resources from a Knowledge Base to dynamically generate localized learning challenges. Learner responses are analyzed by a Generative AI powered server, which delivers personalized feedback and adaptive support. Results from a user evaluation indicate that participants found the system both easy to use and effective for building knowledge related to climate resilience. These findings suggest that integrating IoT and Generative AI into atmospherically adaptive learning technologies holds significant promise for enhancing educational engagement and fostering climate awareness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not e...</summary><p>Not enough evidence to prove the effectiveness of the system in the context of learning about climate change</p></details> |
| **[Assessing and Advancing Benchmarks for Evaluating Large Language Models in Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08903v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in software engineering (SE) due to their unprecedented performance across various applications. These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 291 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDPR-Relevant Privacy Concerns in Mobile Apps Research: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19142v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is considered as the benchmark in the European Union (EU) for privacy and data protection standards. Since before its entry into force in 2018, substantial research has been conducted in the software engineering (SE) literature investigating the elicitation, representation, and verification of GDPR privacy requirements. Software systems deployed anywhere in the world must comply with GDPR as long as they handle personal data of EU residents. Mobile applications (apps) are no different in that regard. With the growing pervasiveness of mobile apps and their increasing demand for personal data, privacy concerns have acquired further interest within the SE community. Despite the extensive literature on GDPR-relevant privacy concerns in mobile apps, there is no secondary study that describes, analyzes, and categorizes the current focus. Research gaps and persistent challenges are thus left unnoticed. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing research on GDPR privacy concerns in the context of mobile apps. To do so, we conducted a systematic literature review of 60 primary studies. Our findings show that existing studies predominantly address three key GDPR-related privacy concerns: (i) the direct collection of personal data from users, (ii) the sharing of personal data with external entities (e.g., third parties) beyond the mobile apps, and (iii) the analysis of user consent as a legal basis for collecting personal data. Our study highlighted research gaps, calling for further research to better understand: (i) the indirect collection of personal data, e.g., data exposed to mobile apps through, e.g., permission requests, (ii) the impact of legal bases beyond consent and how they may affect the development of mobile apps, and (iii) the required implementation details pertinent to data subject rights.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-rebench: An Automated Pipeline for Task Collection and Decontaminated Evaluation of Software Engineering Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20411v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nebius/SWE-rebench, SWE-rebench leaderboard https://swe-rebench.com NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While ChatGPT's potential has been extensively discussed, there is limited empirical evidence exploring its real-world usage by developers. This study bridges this gap by conducting a large-scale empirical analysis of ChatGPT-assisted development activities, leveraging a curated dataset, DevChat, comprising 2,547 unique shared ChatGPT links collected from GitHub between May 2023 and June 2024. Our study examines the characteristics of ChatGPT's usage on GitHub (including the tendency, prompt turns distribution, and link descriptions) and identifies five categories of developers' purposes for sharing developer-ChatGPT conversations during software development. Additionally, we analyzed the development-related activities where developers shared ChatGPT links to facilitate their workflows. We then established a mapping framework among data sources, activities, and SE tasks associated with these shared ChatGPT links. Our study offers a comprehensive view of ChatGPT's application in real-world software development scenarios and provides a foundation for its future integration into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 images, 3 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Emotional Contagion in Code: How GitHub Emoji Reactions Shape Developer Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02515v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developer communities increasingly rely on emoji reactions to communicate, but we know little about how these emotional signals spread and influence technical discussions. We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across 50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We identified five distinct patterns, with "instant enthusiasm" affecting 45.6% of items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p<0.001) with a massive effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional signals create measurable ripple effects. Our work provides empirical evidence that emoji reactions are not mere decoration but active forces shaping collaborative outcomes in software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Lost in Code Generation: Reimagining the Role of Software Models in AI-driven Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02475v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI enables rapid ``vibe coding," where natural language prompts yield working software systems. While this lowers barriers to software creation, it also collapses the boundary between prototypes and engineered software, leading to fragile systems that lack robustness, security, and maintainability. We argue that this shift motivates a reimagining of software models. Rather than serving only as upfront blueprints, models can be recovered post-hoc from AI-generated code to restore comprehension, expose risks, and guide refinement. In this role, models serve as mediators between human intent, AI generation, and long-term system evolution, providing a path toward sustainable AI-driven software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI for Requirements Engineering: Industry adoption and Practitioner perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01324v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of AI for Requirements Engineering (RE) presents significant benefits but also poses real challenges. Although RE is fundamental to software engineering, limited research has examined AI adoption in RE. We surveyed 55 software practitioners to map AI usage across four RE phases: Elicitation, Analysis, Specification, and Validation, and four approaches for decision making: human-only decisions, AI validation, Human AI Collaboration (HAIC), and full AI automation. Participants also shared their perceptions, challenges, and opportunities when applying AI for RE tasks. Our data show that 58.2% of respondents already use AI in RE, and 69.1% view its impact as positive or very positive.HAIC dominates practice, accounting for 54.4% of all RE techniques, while full AI automation remains minimal at 5.4%. Passive AI validation (4.4 to 6.2%) lags even further behind, indicating that practitioners value AI's active support over passive oversight. These findings suggest that AI is most effective when positioned as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human expertise. It also highlights the need for RE-specific HAIC frameworks along with robust and responsible AI governance as AI adoption in RE grows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Intelligent Software Engineering (ISE) 2025 Workshop at the Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[When Continuous Delivery Is Not an Option: Practical Paths to Continuous Engineering in Complex Organizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02445v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) promises improved efficiency, quality, and responsiveness in software-intensive organizations. However, fully adopting CSE is often constrained by complex products, legacy systems, organizational inertia, and regulatory requirements. In this paper, we examine four industrial cases from the automation, automotive, retail, and chemical sectors to explore how such constraints shape CSE adoption in practice. Methods: We apply and extend a previously proposed CSE Industry Readiness Model to assess the current and potential levels of adoption in each case. Through expert interviews and narrative synthesis, we identify common driving forces and adoption barriers, including organizational preparedness, cross-organizational dependencies, and limited customer demand for continuous delivery. Results: Based on our findings, we propose an updated readiness model that introduces additional levels of internal and external feedback, distinguishes market- and organization-facing constraints, and better guides practitioners in setting realistic CSE adoption goals. Conclusions: Our results highlight that while full end-to-end CSE adoption may not always be feasible, meaningful internal improvements are still possible and beneficial. This study provides empirically grounded guidance for organizations navigating partial or constrained CSE transformations.</p></details> |  |

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

LLM-assisted Software Traceability with Architecture Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02434v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying architecturally relevant entities in textual artifacts is crucial for Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) between Software Architecture Documentation (SAD) and source code. While Software Architecture Models (SAMs) can bridge the semantic gap between these artifacts, their manual creation is time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new capabilities for extracting architectural entities from SAD and source code to construct SAMs automatically or establish direct trace links. This paper presents two LLM-based approaches: ExArch extracts component names as simple SAMs from SAD and source code to eliminate the need for manual SAM creation, while ArTEMiS identifies architectural entities in documentation and matches them with (manually or automatically generated) SAM entities. Our evaluation compares against state-of-the-art approaches SWATTR, TransArC and ArDoCode. TransArC achieves strong performance (F1: 0.87) but requires manually created SAMs; ExArch achieves comparable results (F1: 0.86) using only SAD and code. ArTEMiS is on par with the traditional heuristic-based SWATTR (F1: 0.81) and can successfully replace it when integrated with TransArC. The combination of ArTEMiS and ExArch outperforms ArDoCode, the best baseline without manual SAMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively identify architectural entities in textual artifacts, enabling automated SAM generation and TLR, making architecture-code traceability more practical and accessible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Solvers for SLOPE in R, Python, Julia, and C++](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02430v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a suite of packages in R, Python, Julia, and C++ that efficiently solve the Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) problem. The packages feature a highly efficient hybrid coordinate descent algorithm that fits generalized linear models (GLMs) and supports a variety of loss functions, including Gaussian, binomial, Poisson, and multinomial logistic regression. Our implementation is designed to be fast, memory-efficient, and flexible. The packages support a variety of data structures (dense, sparse, and out-of-memory matrices) and are designed to efficiently fit the full SLOPE path as well as handle cross-validation of SLOPE models, including the relaxed SLOPE. We present examples of how to use the packages and benchmarks that demonstrate the performance of the packages on both real and simulated data and show that our packages outperform existing implementations of SLOPE in terms of speed.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |
| **[EvoDev: An Iterative Feature-Driven Framework for End-to-End Software Development with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02399v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language model agents offer the promise of automating end-to-end software development from natural language requirements. However, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines, which oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by 16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for complex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing iterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of base LLMs to better support iterative software development.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, C# -- a prominent enterprise language ranking #5 in the TIOBE index -- remains absent from such benchmarks. We introduce SWE-Sharp-Bench, a reproducible software engineering benchmark for C\# featuring 150 instances from 17 repositories. Evaluating identical model-agent configurations across languages reveals a significant performance gap: while 70% of Python tasks in SWE-Bench Verified are solved, $only 40% of our C\# tasks are resolved. We open-source SWE-Sharp-Bench and our entire curation pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on self-consistency or simulation feedback to select the best candidate, but they miss opportunities to focus LLM reasoning on the most informative parts of the design. We propose VFocus, a three-stage framework that enhances Verilog generation by sharpening the focus of LLM reasoning onto critical decision points in the code generation process. In the \textbf{pre-ranking stage}, VFocus generates multiple code candidates through LLM prompting, retries for syntactically valid outputs, and introduces a \textit{Density-guided Filtering} to retain candidates that fall within the "reasoning sweet spot" for functional correctness. In the \textbf{ranking stage}, we simulate each code candidate using an automatically generated testbench and apply self-consistency-based clustering to identify the most consistent outputs. Finally, in the \textbf{post-ranking refinement stage}, VFocus performs inconsistency mining on top-ranked candidates and invokes reasoning-augmented LLM prompts for candidate refinement. Experiments on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark show that VFocus significantly improves the pass@1 correctness across multiple reasoning LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing Verilog generation for complex hardware design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by SOCC 2025</p></details> |

They can be used in the specification of autonomous driving, avionics, air traffic control, and similar systems. They aim to reduce risks of harm of all kinds including human mortality, environmental damage, and financial loss. However, assurance cases often tend to be organized as extensive documents spanning hundreds of pages, making their creation, review, and maintenance error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious. Therefore, there is a growing need to leverage (semi-)automated techniques, such as those powered by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), to enhance efficiency, consistency, and accuracy across the entire assurance-case lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on assurance case review, a critical task that ensures the quality of assurance cases and therefore fosters their acceptance by regulatory authorities. We propose a novel approach that leverages the \textit{LLM-as-a-judge} paradigm to automate the review process. Specifically, we propose new predicate-based rules that formalize well-established assurance case review criteria, allowing us to craft LLM prompts tailored to the review task. Our experiments on several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) show that, while most LLMs yield relatively good review capabilities, DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 demonstrate superior performance, with DeepSeek-R1 ultimately outperforming GPT-4.1. However, our experimental results also suggest that human reviewers are still needed to refine the reviews LLMs yield.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open the Oyster: Empirical Evaluation and Improvement of Code Reasoning Confidence in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02197v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of code intelligence, increasing attention has been paid to the reliability and controllability of their outputs in code reasoning tasks. Confidence estimation serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects. This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to $0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$ over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence mechanisms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Large Language Models for Natural Language Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02108v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using large language models (LLMs) to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks has become increasingly pervasive in recent times. The versatile nature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the performance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown that they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these faulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs. One obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which necessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors. Metamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this oracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define relationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty behaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This paper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We conducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We implemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments with three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests. The results shed light on the capabilities and opportunities of MT for LLMs, as well as its limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartMLOps Studio: Design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with Automated MLOps Pipelines for Model Development and Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01850v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) applications has intensified the demand for integrated environments that unify model development, deployment, and monitoring. Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering - transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Guided Decompilation: A Step Towards Re-executability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01763v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary decompilation plays an important role in software security analysis, reverse engineering, and malware understanding when source code is unavailable. However, existing decompilation techniques often fail to produce source code that can be successfully recompiled and re-executed, particularly for optimized binaries. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled neural approaches to decompilation, but the generated code is typically only semantically plausible rather than truly executable, limiting their practical reliability. These shortcomings arise from compiler optimizations and the loss of semantic cues in compiled code, which LLMs struggle to recover without contextual guidance. To address this challenge, we propose ICL4Decomp, a hybrid decompilation framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) to guide LLMs toward generating re-executable source code. We evaluate our method across multiple datasets, optimization levels, and compilers, demonstrating around 40\% improvement in re-executability over state-of-the-art decompilation methods while maintaining robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards LLM-Powered Task-Aware Retrieval of Scientific Workflows for Galaxy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01757v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) such as Galaxy have become essential infrastructure in bioinformatics, supporting the design, execution, and sharing of complex multi-step analyses. Despite hosting hundreds of reusable workflows across domains, Galaxy's current keyword-based retrieval system offers limited support for semantic query interpretation and often fails to surface relevant workflows when exact term matches are absent. To address this gap, we propose a task-aware, two-stage retrieval framework that integrates dense vector search with large language model (LLM)-based reranking. Our system first retrieves candidate workflows using state-of-the-art embedding models and then reranks them using instruction-tuned generative LLMs (GPT-4o, Mistral-7B) based on semantic task alignment. To support robust evaluation, we construct a benchmark dataset of Galaxy workflows annotated with semantic topics via BERTopic and synthesize realistic task-oriented queries using LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of lexical, dense, and reranking models using standard IR metrics, presenting the first systematic evaluation of retrieval performance in the Galaxy ecosystem. Results show that our approach significantly improves top-k accuracy and relevance, particularly for long or under-specified queries. We further integrate our system as a prototype tool within Galaxy, providing a proof-of-concept for LLM-enhanced workflow search. This work advances the usability and accessibility of scientific workflows, especially for novice users and interdisciplinary researchers.</p></details> |  |

However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track; switched to IEEE conference template</p></details> |

However, API parameters in these libraries often change during evolution, leading to compatibility issues for client applications reliant on specific versions. Python's flexible parameter-passing mechanism further complicates this, as different passing methods can result in different API compatibility. Currently, no tool can automatically detect and repair Python API parameter compatibility issues. To fill this gap, we introduce PCART, the first solution to fully automate the process of API extraction, code instrumentation, API mapping establishment, compatibility assessment, repair, and validation. PCART handles various types of Python API parameter compatibility issues, including parameter addition, removal, renaming, reordering, and the conversion of positional to keyword parameters. To evaluate PCART, we construct PCBENCH, a large-scale benchmark comprising 47,478 test cases mutated from 844 parameter-changed APIs across 33 popular Python libraries. Evaluation results demonstrate that PCART is both effective and efficient, significantly outperforming existing tools (MLCatchUp and Relancer) and the large language model ChatGPT (GPT-4o), achieving an F1-score of 96.51% in detecting API parameter compatibility issues and a repair precision of 91.97%. Further evaluation on 30 real-world Python projects from GitHub confirms PCART's practicality. We believe PCART can significantly reduce the time programmers spend maintaining Python API updates and advance the automation of Python API compatibility issue repair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing.

| **[From Code Changes to Quality Gains: An Empirical Study in Python ML Systems with PyQu](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02827v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS), software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners, educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Formalizing Regression Testing for Agile and Continuous Integration Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02810v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software developed using modern agile practices delivers a stream of software versions that require continuous regression testing rather than testing once close to the delivery or maintenance phase, as assumed by classical regression-testing theory. In this work, we formalize the phenomenon of continuous or near-continuous regression testing using successive builds as a time-ordered chain, where each build contains the program, requirements, and the accompanying tests. We also formalize the regression test window between any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for the classical two-version case. The formalization is validated by directly representing two state-of-the-art agile regression testing algorithms in terms of build-tuple operations without requiring auxiliary assumptions, followed by proof of the soundness and completeness of our formalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the first attempt to formalize regression testing in agile context as a continuous/near-continuos activity. This formalization will help practitioners and researchers to answer 'when', 'what' and 'how much' question of regression testing in real world time constrained agile projects.

| **[1 PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</p></details> | Under review |

To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants. We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance. Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in language models further enhance this process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and (3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs. Both automated and human evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while still struggling on diff2sum. These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting from long code diffs.</p></details> |  |

These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 291 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |

However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nebius/SWE-rebench, SWE-rebench leaderboard https://swe-rebench.com NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across 50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We identified five distinct patterns, with "instant enthusiasm" affecting 45.6% of items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p<0.001) with a massive effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional signals create measurable ripple effects.

While this lowers barriers to software creation, it also collapses the boundary between prototypes and engineered software, leading to fragile systems that lack robustness, security, and maintainability. We argue that this shift motivates a reimagining of software models. Rather than serving only as upfront blueprints, models can be recovered post-hoc from AI-generated code to restore comprehension, expose risks, and guide refinement. In this role, models serve as mediators between human intent, AI generation, and long-term system evolution, providing a path toward sustainable AI-driven software engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

LLM-assisted Software Traceability with Architecture Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02434v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying architecturally relevant entities in textual artifacts is crucial for Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) between Software Architecture Documentation (SAD) and source code. While Software Architecture Models (SAMs) can bridge the semantic gap between these artifacts, their manual creation is time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new capabilities for extracting architectural entities from SAD and source code to construct SAMs automatically or establish direct trace links. This paper presents two LLM-based approaches: ExArch extracts component names as simple SAMs from SAD and source code to eliminate the need for manual SAM creation, while ArTEMiS identifies architectural entities in documentation and matches them with (manually or automatically generated) SAM entities. Our evaluation compares against state-of-the-art approaches SWATTR, TransArC and ArDoCode. TransArC achieves strong performance (F1: 0.87) but requires manually created SAMs; ExArch achieves comparable results (F1: 0.86) using only SAD and code. ArTEMiS is on par with the traditional heuristic-based SWATTR (F1: 0.81) and can successfully replace it when integrated with TransArC. The combination of ArTEMiS and ExArch outperforms ArDoCode, the best baseline without manual SAMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively identify architectural entities in textual artifacts, enabling automated SAM generation and TLR, making architecture-code traceability more practical and accessible.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines, which oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by 16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for complex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing iterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of base LLMs to better support iterative software development.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

| **[VFocus: Better Verilog Generation from Large Language Model via Focused Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02285v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in generating Verilog codes, but ensuring functional correctness remains a challenge. Existing approaches often rely on self-consistency or simulation feedback to select the best candidate, but they miss opportunities to focus LLM reasoning on the most informative parts of the design. We propose VFocus, a three-stage framework that enhances Verilog generation by sharpening the focus of LLM reasoning onto critical decision points in the code generation process. In the \textbf{pre-ranking stage}, VFocus generates multiple code candidates through LLM prompting, retries for syntactically valid outputs, and introduces a \textit{Density-guided Filtering} to retain candidates that fall within the "reasoning sweet spot" for functional correctness. In the \textbf{ranking stage}, we simulate each code candidate using an automatically generated testbench and apply self-consistency-based clustering to identify the most consistent outputs. Finally, in the \textbf{post-ranking refinement stage}, VFocus performs inconsistency mining on top-ranked candidates and invokes reasoning-augmented LLM prompts for candidate refinement. Experiments on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark show that VFocus significantly improves the pass@1 correctness across multiple reasoning LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing Verilog generation for complex hardware design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by SOCC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Open the Oyster: Empirical Evaluation and Improvement of Code Reasoning Confidence in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02197v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of code intelligence, increasing attention has been paid to the reliability and controllability of their outputs in code reasoning tasks. Confidence estimation serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects. This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to $0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$ over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence mechanisms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering - transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Guided Decompilation: A Step Towards Re-executability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01763v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary decompilation plays an important role in software security analysis, reverse engineering, and malware understanding when source code is unavailable. However, existing decompilation techniques often fail to produce source code that can be successfully recompiled and re-executed, particularly for optimized binaries. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled neural approaches to decompilation, but the generated code is typically only semantically plausible rather than truly executable, limiting their practical reliability. These shortcomings arise from compiler optimizations and the loss of semantic cues in compiled code, which LLMs struggle to recover without contextual guidance. To address this challenge, we propose ICL4Decomp, a hybrid decompilation framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) to guide LLMs toward generating re-executable source code. We evaluate our method across multiple datasets, optimization levels, and compilers, demonstrating around 40\% improvement in re-executability over state-of-the-art decompilation methods while maintaining robustness.</p></details> |  |

| **[From Code Changes to Quality Gains: An Empirical Study in Python ML Systems with PyQu](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02827v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS), software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners, educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Formalizing Regression Testing for Agile and Continuous Integration Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02810v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software developed using modern agile practices delivers a stream of software versions that require continuous regression testing rather than testing once close to the delivery or maintenance phase, as assumed by classical regression-testing theory. In this work, we formalize the phenomenon of continuous or near-continuous regression testing using successive builds as a time-ordered chain, where each build contains the program, requirements, and the accompanying tests. We also formalize the regression test window between any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for the classical two-version case. The formalization is validated by directly representing two state-of-the-art agile regression testing algorithms in terms of build-tuple operations without requiring auxiliary assumptions, followed by proof of the soundness and completeness of our formalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the first attempt to formalize regression testing in agile context as a continuous/near-continuos activity. This formalization will help practitioners and researchers to answer 'when', 'what' and 'how much' question of regression testing in real world time constrained agile projects. This work is currently under review with Software Quality Journal</p></details> |
| **[1 PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</p></details> | Under review |

To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants. We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance. Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReleaseEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in Automated Release Note Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02713v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated release note generation addresses the challenge of documenting frequent software updates, where manual efforts are time-consuming and prone to human error. Although recent advances in language models further enhance this process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and (3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs. Both automated and human evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while still struggling on diff2sum. These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting from long code diffs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Assessing and Advancing Benchmarks for Evaluating Large Language Models in Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08903v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in software engineering (SE) due to their unprecedented performance across various applications. These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 291 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |
