| **[A Metamorphic Testing Perspective on Knowledge Distillation for Language Models of Code: Does the Student Deeply Mimic the Teacher?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05476v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based language models of code have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of software analytics tasks, but their practical deployment remains limited due to high computational costs, slow inference speeds, and significant environmental impact. To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |
| **[SWE-Compass: Towards Unified Evaluation of Agentic Coding Abilities for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05459v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for software engineering has been limited by narrow task coverage, language bias, and insufficient alignment with real-world developer workflows. Existing benchmarks often focus on algorithmic problems or Python-centric bug fixing, leaving critical dimensions of software engineering underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a comprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations into a structured and production-aligned framework. SWE-Compass spans 8 task types, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000 high-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined through systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear hierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover, by aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing agentic coding capabilities in large language models.</p></details> |  |

We constructed Story Arena, a multi-agent "writer's room" in which multiple AI agents, independently imbued with a position statement on the future of software engineering, converse with each other to develop a shared vision. They then use this shared vision to collaboratively construct a design fiction that depicts this vision in narrative form. We present "The Code of Trust," a short fiction that investigates themes of human comprehension, trust, content ownership, augmentation vs. replacement, and uncertain futures in human-AI co-creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

| **[Generating CodeMeta through declarative mapping rules: An open-ended approach using ShExML](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09172v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, software is one of the cornerstones when conducting research in several scientific fields which employ computer-based methodologies to answer new research questions. However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |
| **[Cleaning Maintenance Logs with LLM Agents for Improved Predictive Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05311v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically, we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise. Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Review Automation using Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05302v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but is labor-intensive. Automated code review generation offers a promising solution to this challenge. Both deep learning-based generative techniques and retrieval-based methods have demonstrated strong performance in this task. However, despite these advancements, there are still some limitations where generated reviews can be either off-point or overly general. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reviewer (RARe), which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine retrieval-based and generative methods, explicitly incorporating external domain knowledge into the code review process. RARe uses a dense retriever to select the most relevant reviews from the codebase, which then enrich the input for a neural generator, utilizing the contextual learning capacity of large language models (LLMs), to produce the final review. RARe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 12.32 and 12.96, respectively. Its effectiveness is further validated through a detailed human evaluation and a case study using an interpretability tool, demonstrating its practical utility and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Specialized Software-Assistant ChatBot with Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05297v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs) have become essential tools for helping employees navigate complex enterprise software such as CRM, ERP, or HRMS systems. Companies like LemonLearning have shown how digital guidance can reduce training costs and accelerate onboarding. However, building and maintaining these interactive guides still requires extensive manual effort. Leveraging Large Language Models as virtual assistants is an appealing alternative, yet without a structured understanding of the target software, LLMs often hallucinate and produce unreliable answers. Moreover, most production-grade LLMs are black-box APIs, making fine-tuning impractical due to the lack of access to model weights. In this work, we introduce a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that automatically converts enterprise web applications into state-action knowledge graphs, enabling LLMs to generate grounded and context-aware assistance. The framework was co-developed with the AI enterprise RAKAM, in collaboration with Lemon Learning. We detail the engineering pipeline that extracts and structures software interfaces, the design of the graph-based retrieval process, and the integration of our approach into production DAP workflows. Finally, we discuss scalability, robustness, and deployment lessons learned from industrial use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM4FaaS: No-Code Application Development using LLMs and FaaS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14450v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show great capabilities in generating code from natural language descriptions, bringing programming power closer to non-technical users. However, their lack of expertise in operating the generated code remains a key barrier to realizing customized applications. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer a high level of abstraction for code execution and deployment, allowing users to run LLM-generated code without requiring technical expertise or incurring operational overhead. In this paper, we present LLM4FaaS, a no-code application development approach that integrates LLMs and FaaS platforms to enable non-technical users to build and run customized applications using only natural language. By deploying LLM-generated code through FaaS, LLM4FaaS abstracts away infrastructure management and boilerplate code generation. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype based on an open-source FaaS platform, and evaluate it using real prompts from non-technical users. Experiments with GPT-4o show that LLM4FaaS can automatically build and deploy code in 71.47% of cases, outperforming a non-FaaS baseline at 43.48% and an existing LLM-based platform at 14.55%, narrowing the gap to human performance at 88.99%. Further analysis of code quality, programming language diversity, latency, and consistency demonstrates a balanced performance in terms of efficiency, maintainability and availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing</p></details> |
| **[CodeMapper: A Language-Agnostic Approach to Mapping Code Regions Across Commits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05205v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During software evolution, developers commonly face the problem of mapping a specific code region from one commit to another. For example, they may want to determine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a configuration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the code mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this problem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file instead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other techniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g., methods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces CodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is independent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a code region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another commit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by analyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code fragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating similarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two new hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular programming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target region in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available baselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Software Architecture Description from Source Code using Reverse Engineering and Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05165v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dependencies between modules can trigger ripple effects when changes are made, making maintenance complex and costly, so minimizing these dependencies is crucial. Consequently, understanding what drives dependencies is important. One potential factor is code smells, which are symptoms in code that indicate design issues and reduce code quality. When multiple code smells interact through static dependencies, their combined impact on quality can be even more severe. While individual code smells have been widely studied, the influence of their interactions remains underexplored. In this study, we aim to investigate whether and how the distribution of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify these interactions by comparing cases where code smell interactions exist and where they do not. Our results suggest that overall, code smell interactions are linked to a significant increase in total dependencies in 28 out of 36 cases, and that all code smells are associated with a consistent change direction (increase or decrease) in certain dependency types when interacting with other code smells. Consequently, this information can be used to support more accurate code smell detection and prioritization, as well as to develop more effective refactoring strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chasing One-day Vulnerabilities Across Open Source Forks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05097v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking vulnerabilities inherited from third-party open-source components is a well-known challenge, often addressed by tracing the threads of dependency information. However, vulnerabilities can also propagate through forking: a repository forked after the introduction of a vulnerability, but before it is patched, may remain vulnerable in the fork well after being fixed in the original project. Current approaches for vulnerability analysis lack the commit-level granularity needed to track vulnerability introductions and fixes across forks, potentially leaving one-day vulnerabilities undetected. This paper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day vulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public code, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates vulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact analysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not incorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162 repositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their development histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one vulnerable commit. Then we perform a strict filtering, allowing us to find 356 ___vulnerability, fork___ pairs impacting active and popular GitHub forks, we manually evaluate 65 pairs, finding 3 high-severity vulnerabilities, demonstrating the impact and applicability of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Is Self-admitted Code Generated by Large Language Models on GitHub?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19544v4)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has garnered significant attention from researchers evaluating the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for code generation. However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which do not adequately capture the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To address this gap, our study investigates self-admitted code generated by LLMs on GitHub, specifically focusing on instances where developers in projects with over five stars acknowledge the use of LLMs to generate code through code comments. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot dominate code generation, with minimal contributions from other LLMs. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code appears in small/medium-sized projects led by small teams, which are continuously evolving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally is a minor project portion, primarily generating short/moderate-length, low-complexity snippets (e.g., algorithms and data structures code; text processing code). (4) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally undergoes minimal modifications, with bug-related changes ranging from 4% to 12%. (5) Most code comments only state LLM use, while few include details like prompts, human edits, or code testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[UA-Code-Bench: A Competitive Programming Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Code Generation in Ukrainian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05040v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code generation, and evaluation scripts are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NLPForUA/ua-code-bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Black-box Context-free Grammar Inference for Readable & Natural Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26616v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis, reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada, and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large, complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Collaborative Agents for Automated Program Repair in Ruby](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03925v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced rapidly with Large Language Models (LLMs), but most existing methods remain computationally expensive, and focused on a small set of languages. Ruby, despite its widespread use in web development and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received little attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel lightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven, iterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that generate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a correct solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid reliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead operating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven feedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a pass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly within five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and self-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that RAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors, and runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair strategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging tools to under-studied languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartMLOps Studio: Design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with Automated MLOps Pipelines for Model Development and Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01850v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) applications has intensified the demand for integrated environments that unify model development, deployment, and monitoring. Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering - transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of LLM-Based Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01176v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various software engineering tasks, such as code generation and debugging, because of their ability to translate between programming languages and natural languages. Existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in code clone detection. However, two crucial issues remain unaddressed: the ability of LLMs to achieve comparable performance across different datasets and the consistency of LLMs' responses in code clone detection. To address these issues, we constructed seven code clone datasets and then evaluated five LLMs in four existing prompts with these datasets. The datasets were created by sampling code pairs using their Levenshtein ratio from two different code collections, CodeNet and BigCloneBench. Our evaluation revealed that although LLMs perform well in CodeNet-related datasets, with o3-mini achieving a 0.943 F1 score, their performance significantly decreased in BigCloneBench-related datasets. Most models achieved a high response consistency, with over 90\% of judgments remaining consistent across all five submissions. The fluctuations of the F1 score affected by inconsistency are also tiny; their variations are less than 0.03.</p></details> |  |
| **[HarnessLLM: Automatic Testing Harness Generation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01104v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM-based automatic test generation methods mainly produce input and expected output pairs to categorize the intended behavior of correct programs. Although straightforward, these methods have limited diversity in generated tests and cannot provide enough debugging information. We propose HarnessLLM, a two-stage training pipeline that enables LLMs to write harness code for testing. Particularly, LLMs generate code that synthesizes inputs and validates the observed outputs, allowing complex test cases and flexible output validation such as invariant checking. To achieve this, we train LLMs with SFT followed by RLVR with a customized reward design. Experiments show that HarnessLLM outperforms input-output-based testing in bug finding and testing strategy diversity. HarnessLLM further benefits the code generation performance through test-time scaling with our generated test cases as inference-phase validation. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/HarnessLLM.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentGit: A Version Control Framework for Reliable and Scalable LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00628v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) are drawing increasing interest across academia and industry. However, many current MAS frameworks struggle with reliability and scalability, especially on complex tasks. We present AgentGit, a framework that brings Git-like rollback and branching to MAS workflows. Built as an infrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit, revert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore multiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an experiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts. We ran a multi-step A/B test against three baselines -- LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno -- on a real-world task: retrieving and analyzing paper abstracts. Results show that AgentGit significantly reduces redundant computation, lowers runtime and token usage, and supports parallel exploration across multiple branches, enhancing both reliability and scalability in MAS development. This work offers a practical path to more robust MAS design and enables error recovery, safe exploration, iterative debugging, and A/B testing in collaborative AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> | Accepted at ASE 2025 |
| **[Reasoning Trajectories for Socratic Debugging of Student Code: From Misconceptions to Contradictions and Updated Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00371v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Socratic debugging, instructors guide students towards identifying and fixing a bug on their own, instead of providing the bug fix directly. Most novice programmer bugs are caused by programming misconceptions, namely false beliefs about a programming concept. In this context, Socratic debugging can be formulated as a guided Reasoning Trajectory (RT) leading to a statement about the program behavior that contradicts the bug-causing misconception. Upon reaching this statement, the ensuing cognitive dissonance leads the student to first identify and then update their false belief. In this paper, we introduce the task of reasoning trajectory generation, together with a dataset of debugging problems manually annotated with RTs. We then describe LLM-based solutions for generating RTs and Socratic conversations that are anchored on them. A large-scale LLM-as-judge evaluation shows that frontier models can generate up to 91% correct reasoning trajectories and 98.7% valid conversation turns.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 tables, 13 figures</p></details> |

While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills. We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved. We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current automated feedback generation tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online and Interactive Bayesian Inference Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26579v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement. During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Automated Program Repair Based on REST API Specifications Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25148v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many cloud services provide REST API accessible to client applications. However, developers often identify specification violations only during testing, as error messages typically lack the detail necessary for effective diagnosis. Consequently, debugging requires trial and error. This study proposes dcFix, a method for detecting and automatically repairing REST API misuses in client programs. In particular, dcFix identifies non-conforming code fragments, integrates them with the relevant API specifications into prompts, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the corrected code. Our evaluation demonstrates that dcFix accurately detects misuse and outperforms the baseline approach, in which prompts to the LLM omit any indication of code fragments non conforming to REST API specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGNET: A Multi-Graph Attentional Network for Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24241v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection is a fundamental task in software engineering that underpins refactoring, debugging, plagiarism detection, and vulnerability analysis. Existing methods often rely on singular representations such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs (CFGs), and data flow graphs (DFGs), which capture only partial aspects of code semantics. Hybrid approaches have emerged, but their fusion strategies are typically handcrafted and ineffective. In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional framework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture syntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual graph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and long-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for fine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse multi-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive experiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\% and 99.2\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZixianReid/Multigraph_match</p></details> |  |
| **[TDFlow: Agentic Workflows for Test Driven Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23761v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TDFlow, a novel test-driven agentic workflow that frames repository-scale software engineering as a test-resolution task, specifically designed to solve human-written tests. Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly proposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely engineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective sub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch revision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any individual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined sub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific sub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on SWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and 94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within SWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which were subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary obstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing successful reproduction tests. We envision a human-LLM interactive system powered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems. Together, these results indicate that modern LLMs, when embedded in a narrowly engineered, test-driven workflow, already achieve human-level test resolution -- with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the accurate generation of valid reproduction tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[SBEST: Spectrum-Based Fault Localization Without Fault-Triggering Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00565v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization is a critical step in software maintenance. Yet, many existing techniques, such as Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL), rely heavily on the availability of fault-triggering tests to be effective. In practice, especially for crash-related bugs, such tests are frequently unavailable. Meanwhile, bug reports containing stack traces often serve as the only available evidence of runtime failures and provide valuable context for debugging. This study investigates the feasibility of using stack traces from crash reports as proxies for fault-triggering tests in SBFL. Our empirical analysis of 60 crash-report bugs in Defects4J reveals that only 3.33% of these bugs have fault-triggering tests available at the time of the bug report creation. However, 98.3% of bug fixes directly address the exception observed in the stack trace, and 78.3% of buggy methods are reachable within an average of 0.34 method calls from the stack trace. These findings underscore the diagnostic value of stack traces in the absence of failing tests. Motivated by these findings, we propose SBEST, a novel approach that integrates stack trace information with test coverage data to perform fault localization when fault-triggering tests are missing. SBEST shows an improvement, with a 32.22% increase in Mean Average Precision (MAP) and a 17.43% increase in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) compared to baseline approaches under the scenario where fault-triggering tests are absent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Empir...</summary><p>Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |

Yet few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, potentially due to the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench has 111 curated and reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific out-of-order execution issue. To support reproducibility and ease of use, JunoBench offers a unified execution environment where crashes and fixes can be reliably reproduced. By providing realistic crashes and their resolutions, JunoBench facilitates bug detection, localization, diagnosis, and repair tailored to the interactive and iterative nature of notebook-based ML development.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisCoder2: Building Multi-Language Visualization Coding Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23642v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage, unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents. VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching 82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or compiler-dependent languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering: the Road Ahead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04797v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to handle the increasing complexity of software systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied to various areas of software engineering, including requirements engineering, coding, testing, and debugging. This has led to the emergence of AI for Software Engineering as a distinct research area within the field of software engineering. With the development of quantum computing, the field of Quantum AI (QAI) is arising, enhancing the performance of classical AI and holding significant potential for solving classical software engineering problems. Some initial applications of QAI in software engineering have already emerged, such as test case optimization. However, the path ahead remains open, offering ample opportunities to solve complex software engineering problems cost-effectively with QAI. To this end, this paper presents a roadmap towards the application of QAI in software engineering. Specifically, we consider two of the main categories of QAI, i.e., quantum optimization algorithms and quantum machine learning. For each software engineering phase, we discuss how these QAI approaches can address some of the tasks associated with that phase. Moreover, we provide an overview of some of the possible challenges that need to be addressed to make the application of QAI for software engineering successful.</p></details> |  |

However, fidelity issues often degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89% and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%, Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.</p></details> |  |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |

While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhyFlow: Interrogative Debugger for Sensemaking Taint Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |

Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Final Code: A Process-Oriented Error Analysis of Software Development Agents in Real-World GitHub Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICSE 2026, Research Track</p></details> |

A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon their submissions after repeated TLE failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely performance issues. Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same 1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.</p></details> |  |

Automated repair of such failures is promising, but existing techniques rely on test cases, which are not available for non-compilable code. We employ an automated repair approach for compilation errors driven by large language models (LLMs). Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000 commits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours typically required for manual debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference: 2025 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)</p></details> |
| **[Can ChatGPT support software verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |
| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69 AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95% CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90% relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1 inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus 28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%) occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points; arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven, provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis with end-to-end auditability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, link to code repo</p></details> |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

However, the reality of video games require its own set of unique debugging techniques such as On-Screen Console, Debug Draws, Debug Camera, Cheats and In-Game Menus, and Data Scrubbing. In this article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, gas 2026 conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |

We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite their importance, no existing evaluation benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework, HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting in Practice: Investigating Software Developers' Use of Generative AI Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06000v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has fundamentally transformed software development. Although prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill, existing research focuses primarily on individual techniques rather than software developers' broader workflows. This study presents a systematic investigation of how software engineers integrate GenAI tools into their professional practice through a large-scale survey examining prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across various software engineering tasks. We surveyed 91 software engineers, including 72 active GenAI users, to understand AI usage patterns throughout the development process. Our 14 key findings show that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency strongly correlates with using AI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and code review, and that developers prefer iterative multi-turn conversations to single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable, while complex code generation and debugging present sizable challenges. Our insights provide an empirical baseline of current developer practices, from simple code generation to deeper workflow integration, with actionable insights for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[RedCodeAgent: Automatic Red-teaming Agent against Diverse Code Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02609v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.</p></details> |  |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging approach should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with the tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |

Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap, this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity. Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes. Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts. Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences, necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |
| **[Vibe Coding in Practice: Motivations, Challenges, and a Future Outlook -- a Grey Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00328v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools are transforming software development, especially for novice and non-software developers, by enabling them to write code and build applications faster and with little to no human intervention. Vibe coding is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code. Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101 practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools' outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers, particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping, but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJjFfnxUx0.</p></details> |  |
| **[TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.</p></details> |  |

Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress (V2)</p></details> |

LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence-Guided Concolic Testing of Transformer Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23806v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an {influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible, pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring, compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that (i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration, and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering potential utility for debugging and model auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Specific Instruction: A Longitudinal Study on Debugging Skill Acquisition and Retention for Novice Programmers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22420v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localization is a critical skill, yet novices often lack systematic approaches. Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps; the impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week longitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract guidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that pairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4). Forty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5). Each session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element containing a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to completion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and strategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to completion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other groups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p < 0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other groups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses showed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants internalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that context-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger retention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions produced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized performance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may bridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more equitable path for novices.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (25 pages for the paper, rest pages are references and appendix). 4 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[SecureAgentBench: Benchmarking Secure Code Generation under Realistic Vulnerability Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22097v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents (SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions, (ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step toward more reliable software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |

Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Co-evolutionary Metamorphic Differential Testing for Autonomous Systems with an Interpretability Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16478v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, such as autonomous driving systems, evolve rapidly through frequent updates, risking unintended behavioral degradations. Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment. CoCoMagic offers an efficient, effective, and interpretable way for the differential testing of evolving autonomous systems across versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous systems, giving rise to a new class of software known as Agentware, where LLM-powered agents perform complex, open-ended tasks in domains such as software engineering, customer service, and data analysis. However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |

Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |

A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rethinking Technology Stack Selection with AI Coding Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11132v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now an integral part of software development workflows and are reshaping the whole process. Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Existing benchmarks often focus on algorithmic problems or Python-centric bug fixing, leaving critical dimensions of software engineering underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a comprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations into a structured and production-aligned framework. SWE-Compass spans 8 task types, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000 high-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined through systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear hierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover, by aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing agentic coding capabilities in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Is Self-admitted Code Generated by Large Language Models on GitHub?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19544v4)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has garnered significant attention from researchers evaluating the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for code generation. However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which do not adequately capture the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To address this gap, our study investigates self-admitted code generated by LLMs on GitHub, specifically focusing on instances where developers in projects with over five stars acknowledge the use of LLMs to generate code through code comments. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot dominate code generation, with minimal contributions from other LLMs. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code appears in small/medium-sized projects led by small teams, which are continuously evolving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally is a minor project portion, primarily generating short/moderate-length, low-complexity snippets (e.g., algorithms and data structures code; text processing code). (4) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally undergoes minimal modifications, with bug-related changes ranging from 4% to 12%. (5) Most code comments only state LLM use, while few include details like prompts, human edits, or code testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[What About Our Bug? A Study on the Responsiveness of NPM Package Maintainers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04986v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Widespread use of third-party libraries makes ecosystems like Node Package Manager (npm) critical to modern software development. However, this interconnected chain of dependencies also creates challenges: bugs in one library can propagate downstream, potentially impacting many other libraries that rely on it. We hypothesize that maintainers may not always decide to fix a bug, especially if the maintainer decides it falls out of their responsibility within the chain of dependencies. Aims: To confirm this hypothesis, we investigate the responsiveness of 30,340 bug reports across 500 of the most depended-upon npm packages. Method: We adopt a mixed-method approach to mine repository issue data and perform qualitative open coding to analyze reasons behind unaddressed bug reports. Results: Our findings show that maintainers are generally responsive, with a median project-level responsiveness of 70% (IQR: 55%-89%), reflecting their commitment to support downstream developers. Conclusions: We present a taxonomy of the reasons some bugs remain unresolved. The taxonomy includes contribution practices, dependency constraints, and library-specific standards as reasons for not being responsive. Understanding maintainer behavior can inform practices that promote a more robust and responsive open-source ecosystem that benefits the entire community.</p></details> |  |

| **[Agentic Refactoring: An Empirical Study of AI Coding Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04824v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic coding tools, such as OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor, are transforming the software engineering landscape. These AI-powered systems function as autonomous teammates capable of planning and executing complex development tasks. Agents have become active participants in refactoring, a cornerstone of sustainable software development aimed at improving internal code quality without altering observable behavior. Despite their increasing adoption, there is a critical lack of empirical understanding regarding how agentic refactoring is utilized in practice, how it compares to human-driven refactoring, and what impact it has on code quality. To address this empirical gap, we present a large-scale study of AI agent-generated refactorings in real-world open-source Java projects, analyzing 15,451 refactoring instances across 12,256 pull requests and 14,988 commits derived from the AIDev dataset. Our empirical analysis shows that refactoring is a common and intentional activity in this development paradigm, with agents explicitly targeting refactoring in 26.1% of commits. Analysis of refactoring types reveals that agentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as Change Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable (8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level design changes common in human refactoring. Additionally, the motivations behind agentic refactoring focus overwhelmingly on internal quality concerns, with maintainability (52.5%) and readability (28.1%). Furthermore, quantitative evaluation of code quality metrics shows that agentic refactoring yields small but statistically significant improvements in structural metrics, particularly for medium-level changes, reducing class size and complexity (e.g., Class LOC median $\Delta$ = -15.25).</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 Tables, 5 Figuress, Submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology(TOSEM)</p></details> |
| **[Testora: Using Natural Language Intent to Detect Behavioral Regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18597v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software is evolving, code changes can introduce regression bugs or affect the behavior in other unintended ways. Traditional regression test generation is impractical for detecting unintended behavioral changes, because it reports all behavioral differences as potential regressions. However, most code changes are intended to change the behavior in some way, e.g., to fix a bug or to add a new feature. This paper presents Testora, the first automated approach that detects regressions by comparing the intentions of a code change against behavioral differences caused by the code change. Given a pull request (PR), Testora queries an LLM to generate tests that exercise the modified code, compares the behavior of the original and modified code, and classifies any behavioral differences as intended or unintended. For the classification, we present an LLM-based technique that leverages the natural language information associated with the PR, such as the title, description, and commit messages -- effectively using the natural language intent to detect behavioral regressions. Applying Testora to PRs of complex and popular Python projects, we find 19 regression bugs and 11 PRs that, despite having another intention, coincidentally fix a bug. Out of 13 regressions reported to the developers, 11 have been confirmed and 9 have already been fixed. The costs of using Testora are acceptable for real-world deployment, with 12.3 minutes to check a PR and LLM costs of only $0.003 per PR. We envision our approach to be used before or shortly after a code change gets merged into a code base, providing a way to early on detect regressions that are not caught by traditional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2026</p></details> |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate secure code generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach. Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from 70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the benefits.

| **[The OpenHands Software Agent SDK: A Composable and Extensible Foundation for Production Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03690v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents are now used widely in the process of software development, but building production-ready software engineering agents is a complex task. Deploying software agents effectively requires flexibility in implementation and experimentation, reliable and secure execution, and interfaces for users to interact with agents. In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent SDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these desiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent components of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents, which has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple interface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the default case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents with features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security and reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability, integrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can connect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS Code, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing SDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native sandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and built-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow the OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for prototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably deploying agents at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAFixAgent: History-Aware Automated Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01047v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has recently shifted toward large language models and agent-based systems, yet most systems rely on local snapshot context, overlooking repository history. Prior work shows that repository history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Risk Estimation in Differential Fuzzing via Extreme Value Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02927v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing is a highly effective technique for automatically detecting software bugs and vulnerabilities when the specifications involve an analysis over multiple executions simultaneously. Differential fuzzing, in particular, operates as a guided randomized search, aiming to find (similar) inputs that lead to a maximum difference in software outputs or their behaviors. However, fuzzing, as a dynamic analysis, lacks any guarantees on the absence of bugs: from a differential fuzzing campaign that has observed no bugs (or a minimal difference), what is the risk of observing a bug (or a larger difference) if we run the fuzzer for one or more steps? This paper investigates the application of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to address the risk of missing or underestimating bugs in differential fuzzing. The key observation is that differential fuzzing as a random process resembles the maximum distribution of observed differences. Hence, EVT, a branch of statistics dealing with extreme values, is an ideal framework to analyze the tail of the differential fuzzing campaign to contain the risk. We perform experiments on a set of real-world Java libraries and use differential fuzzing to find information leaks via side channels in these libraries. We first explore the feasibility of EVT for this task and the optimal hyperparameters for EVT distributions. We then compare EVT-based extrapolation against baseline statistical methods like Markov's as well as Chebyshev's inequalities, and the Bayes factor. EVT-based extrapolations outperform the baseline techniques in 14.3% of cases and tie with the baseline in 64.2% of cases. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy and performance gains of EVT-enabled differential fuzzing in real-world Java libraries, where we reported an average saving of tens of millions of bytecode executions by an early stop.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 25), 13 Pages, 4 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

We exploit the modular structure of the plant to be controlled, given as a set of labelled transition systems (LTS), to mitigate state explosion that monolithic approaches to synthesis are prone to. Maximally permissive safe controllers are iteratively built for subsets of the plant LTSs by solving weaker control problems. Observational synthesis equivalence is used to reduce the size of the controlled subset of the plant by abstracting away local events. The result of synthesis is also compositional, a set of controllers that when run in parallel ensure the LTL goal. We implement synthesis in the MTSA tool for an expressive subset of LTL, GR(1), and show it computes solutions to that can be up to 1000 times larger than those that the monolithic approach can solve.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CAV25</p></details> |
| **[Investigating the Experience of Autistic Individuals in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02736v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) leads to various issues in the everyday life of autistic individuals, often resulting in unemployment and mental health problems. To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants. We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance. Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often focus on algorithmic problems or Python-centric bug fixing, leaving critical dimensions of software engineering underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a comprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations into a structured and production-aligned framework. SWE-Compass spans 8 task types, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000 high-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined through systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear hierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover, by aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing agentic coding capabilities in large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, their lack of expertise in operating the generated code remains a key barrier to realizing customized applications. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer a high level of abstraction for code execution and deployment, allowing users to run LLM-generated code without requiring technical expertise or incurring operational overhead. In this paper, we present LLM4FaaS, a no-code application development approach that integrates LLMs and FaaS platforms to enable non-technical users to build and run customized applications using only natural language. By deploying LLM-generated code through FaaS, LLM4FaaS abstracts away infrastructure management and boilerplate code generation. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype based on an open-source FaaS platform, and evaluate it using real prompts from non-technical users. Experiments with GPT-4o show that LLM4FaaS can automatically build and deploy code in 71.47% of cases, outperforming a non-FaaS baseline at 43.48% and an existing LLM-based platform at 14.55%, narrowing the gap to human performance at 88.99%. Further analysis of code quality, programming language diversity, latency, and consistency demonstrates a balanced performance in terms of efficiency, maintainability and availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing</p></details> |

For example, they may want to determine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a configuration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the code mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this problem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file instead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other techniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g., methods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces CodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is independent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a code region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another commit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by analyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code fragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating similarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two new hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular programming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target region in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available baselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models.

We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically, we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise. Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Review Automation using Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05302v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but is labor-intensive. Automated code review generation offers a promising solution to this challenge. Both deep learning-based generative techniques and retrieval-based methods have demonstrated strong performance in this task. However, despite these advancements, there are still some limitations where generated reviews can be either off-point or overly general. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reviewer (RARe), which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine retrieval-based and generative methods, explicitly incorporating external domain knowledge into the code review process. RARe uses a dense retriever to select the most relevant reviews from the codebase, which then enrich the input for a neural generator, utilizing the contextual learning capacity of large language models (LLMs), to produce the final review. RARe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 12.32 and 12.96, respectively. Its effectiveness is further validated through a detailed human evaluation and a case study using an interpretability tool, demonstrating its practical utility and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Specialized Software-Assistant ChatBot with Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05297v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs) have become essential tools for helping employees navigate complex enterprise software such as CRM, ERP, or HRMS systems. Companies like LemonLearning have shown how digital guidance can reduce training costs and accelerate onboarding. However, building and maintaining these interactive guides still requires extensive manual effort. Leveraging Large Language Models as virtual assistants is an appealing alternative, yet without a structured understanding of the target software, LLMs often hallucinate and produce unreliable answers. Moreover, most production-grade LLMs are black-box APIs, making fine-tuning impractical due to the lack of access to model weights. In this work, we introduce a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that automatically converts enterprise web applications into state-action knowledge graphs, enabling LLMs to generate grounded and context-aware assistance. The framework was co-developed with the AI enterprise RAKAM, in collaboration with Lemon Learning. We detail the engineering pipeline that extracts and structures software interfaces, the design of the graph-based retrieval process, and the integration of our approach into production DAP workflows. Finally, we discuss scalability, robustness, and deployment lessons learned from industrial use cases.</p></details> |  |

However, their lack of expertise in operating the generated code remains a key barrier to realizing customized applications. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer a high level of abstraction for code execution and deployment, allowing users to run LLM-generated code without requiring technical expertise or incurring operational overhead. In this paper, we present LLM4FaaS, a no-code application development approach that integrates LLMs and FaaS platforms to enable non-technical users to build and run customized applications using only natural language. By deploying LLM-generated code through FaaS, LLM4FaaS abstracts away infrastructure management and boilerplate code generation. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype based on an open-source FaaS platform, and evaluate it using real prompts from non-technical users. Experiments with GPT-4o show that LLM4FaaS can automatically build and deploy code in 71.47% of cases, outperforming a non-FaaS baseline at 43.48% and an existing LLM-based platform at 14.55%, narrowing the gap to human performance at 88.99%. Further analysis of code quality, programming language diversity, latency, and consistency demonstrates a balanced performance in terms of efficiency, maintainability and availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing</p></details> |
| **[CodeMapper: A Language-Agnostic Approach to Mapping Code Regions Across Commits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05205v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During software evolution, developers commonly face the problem of mapping a specific code region from one commit to another. For example, they may want to determine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a configuration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the code mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this problem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file instead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other techniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g., methods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces CodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is independent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a code region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another commit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by analyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code fragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating similarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two new hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular programming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target region in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available baselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Software Architecture Description from Source Code using Reverse Engineering and Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05165v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dependencies between modules can trigger ripple effects when changes are made, making maintenance complex and costly, so minimizing these dependencies is crucial. Consequently, understanding what drives dependencies is important. One potential factor is code smells, which are symptoms in code that indicate design issues and reduce code quality. When multiple code smells interact through static dependencies, their combined impact on quality can be even more severe. While individual code smells have been widely studied, the influence of their interactions remains underexplored. In this study, we aim to investigate whether and how the distribution of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify these interactions by comparing cases where code smell interactions exist and where they do not. Our results suggest that overall, code smell interactions are linked to a significant increase in total dependencies in 28 out of 36 cases, and that all code smells are associated with a consistent change direction (increase or decrease) in certain dependency types when interacting with other code smells. Consequently, this information can be used to support more accurate code smell detection and prioritization, as well as to develop more effective refactoring strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chasing One-day Vulnerabilities Across Open Source Forks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05097v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking vulnerabilities inherited from third-party open-source components is a well-known challenge, often addressed by tracing the threads of dependency information. However, vulnerabilities can also propagate through forking: a repository forked after the introduction of a vulnerability, but before it is patched, may remain vulnerable in the fork well after being fixed in the original project. Current approaches for vulnerability analysis lack the commit-level granularity needed to track vulnerability introductions and fixes across forks, potentially leaving one-day vulnerabilities undetected. This paper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day vulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public code, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates vulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact analysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not incorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162 repositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their development histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one vulnerable commit. Then we perform a strict filtering, allowing us to find 356 ___vulnerability, fork___ pairs impacting active and popular GitHub forks, we manually evaluate 65 pairs, finding 3 high-severity vulnerabilities, demonstrating the impact and applicability of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Is Self-admitted Code Generated by Large Language Models on GitHub?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19544v4)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has garnered significant attention from researchers evaluating the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for code generation. However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which do not adequately capture the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To address this gap, our study investigates self-admitted code generated by LLMs on GitHub, specifically focusing on instances where developers in projects with over five stars acknowledge the use of LLMs to generate code through code comments. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot dominate code generation, with minimal contributions from other LLMs. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code appears in small/medium-sized projects led by small teams, which are continuously evolving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally is a minor project portion, primarily generating short/moderate-length, low-complexity snippets (e.g., algorithms and data structures code; text processing code). (4) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally undergoes minimal modifications, with bug-related changes ranging from 4% to 12%. (5) Most code comments only state LLM use, while few include details like prompts, human edits, or code testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[UA-Code-Bench: A Competitive Programming Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Code Generation in Ukrainian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05040v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code generation, and evaluation scripts are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NLPForUA/ua-code-bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[What About Our Bug? A Study on the Responsiveness of NPM Package Maintainers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04986v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Widespread use of third-party libraries makes ecosystems like Node Package Manager (npm) critical to modern software development. However, this interconnected chain of dependencies also creates challenges: bugs in one library can propagate downstream, potentially impacting many other libraries that rely on it. We hypothesize that maintainers may not always decide to fix a bug, especially if the maintainer decides it falls out of their responsibility within the chain of dependencies. Aims: To confirm this hypothesis, we investigate the responsiveness of 30,340 bug reports across 500 of the most depended-upon npm packages. Method: We adopt a mixed-method approach to mine repository issue data and perform qualitative open coding to analyze reasons behind unaddressed bug reports. Results: Our findings show that maintainers are generally responsive, with a median project-level responsiveness of 70% (IQR: 55%-89%), reflecting their commitment to support downstream developers. Conclusions: We present a taxonomy of the reasons some bugs remain unresolved. The taxonomy includes contribution practices, dependency constraints, and library-specific standards as reasons for not being responsive. Understanding maintainer behavior can inform practices that promote a more robust and responsive open-source ecosystem that benefits the entire community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-box Context-free Grammar Inference for Readable & Natural Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26616v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis, reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada, and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large, complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |

While its use in coding tasks shows considerable promise, applying GenAI across the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has not yet been fully explored. Critical uncertainties in areas such as reliability, accountability, security, and data privacy demand deeper investigation and coordinated action. The GENIUS project, comprising over 30 European industrial and academic partners, aims to address these challenges by advancing AI integration across all SDLC phases. It focuses on GenAI's potential, the development of innovative tools, and emerging research challenges, actively shaping the future of software engineering. This vision paper presents a shared perspective on the future of GenAI-driven software engineering, grounded in cross-sector dialogue as well as experiences and findings within the GENIUS consortium. The paper explores four central elements: (1) a structured overview of current challenges in GenAI adoption across the SDLC; (2) a forward-looking vision outlining key technological and methodological advances expected over the next five years; (3) anticipated shifts in the roles and required skill sets of software professionals; and (4) the contribution of GENIUS in realising this transformation through practical tools and industrial validation. This paper focuses on aligning technical innovation with business relevance. It aims to inform both research agendas and industrial strategies, providing a foundation for reliable, scalable, and industry-ready GenAI solutions for software engineering teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware 2025)</p></details> |

Developing SDV-specific applications demands advanced tools to streamline code generation and improve development efficiency. In recent years, general-purpose large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across domains. Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match the expected outcomes based on quantitative metrics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Existing studies reveal that up to 70% of robotics algorithms cannot be reproduced by independent teams, while many others fail to reach deployment because creating shareable software environments remains prohibitively complex. These challenges stem from fragmented, multi-language, and hardware-software toolchains that lead to dependency hell. We present Pixi, a unified package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers. Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours to minutes and lowers technical barriers for researchers worldwide. By enabling scalable, reproducible, collaborative research infrastructure, Pixi accelerates progress in robotics and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 3 figures, 11 code snippets</p></details> |

These AI-powered systems function as autonomous teammates capable of planning and executing complex development tasks. Agents have become active participants in refactoring, a cornerstone of sustainable software development aimed at improving internal code quality without altering observable behavior. Despite their increasing adoption, there is a critical lack of empirical understanding regarding how agentic refactoring is utilized in practice, how it compares to human-driven refactoring, and what impact it has on code quality. To address this empirical gap, we present a large-scale study of AI agent-generated refactorings in real-world open-source Java projects, analyzing 15,451 refactoring instances across 12,256 pull requests and 14,988 commits derived from the AIDev dataset. Our empirical analysis shows that refactoring is a common and intentional activity in this development paradigm, with agents explicitly targeting refactoring in 26.1% of commits. Analysis of refactoring types reveals that agentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as Change Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable (8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level design changes common in human refactoring. Additionally, the motivations behind agentic refactoring focus overwhelmingly on internal quality concerns, with maintainability (52.5%) and readability (28.1%). Furthermore, quantitative evaluation of code quality metrics shows that agentic refactoring yields small but statistically significant improvements in structural metrics, particularly for medium-level changes, reducing class size and complexity (e.g., Class LOC median $\Delta$ = -15.25).</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 Tables, 5 Figuress, Submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology(TOSEM)</p></details> |

Mapping methods are widely used across disciplines to visualize relationships among objects as spatial representations, or maps. However, most existing statistical software supports only static mapping, which captures objects' relationships at a single point in time and lacks tools to analyze how these relationships evolve. evomap fills this gap by implementing the dynamic mapping framework EvoMap, originally proposed by Matthe, Ringel, and Skiera (2023), which adapts traditional static mapping methods for dynamic analyses. The package supports multiple mapping techniques, including variants of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Sammon Mapping, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). It also includes utilities for data preprocessing, exploration, and result evaluation, offering a comprehensive toolkit for dynamic mapping applications. This paper outlines the foundations of static and dynamic mapping, describes the architecture and functionality of evomap, and illustrates its application through an extensive usage example.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by the Journal of Statistical Software</p></details> |

To trace the root cause of the inter-module coupling, this paper, starting from the impact assessment approach for module changes, proposes a conceptual method for calculating module independence and utilizes this method to derive the necessary conditions for module independence. Then, a new system design philosophy and software engineering methodology is proposed, aimed at eliminating dependencies between modules. A specific pattern is employed to design a set of universal interfaces, serving as a universal boundary between modules. Subsequently, this method is used to implement a platform architecture named EIGHT, demonstrating that, as long as module independence is guaranteed, even a monolithic application within a single process can dynamically load, unload, or modify any part at runtime. Finally, the paper concludes that this architecture aims to explore a novel path for increasingly complex systems, beyond microservice and monolithic architectures.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Testora: Using Natural Language Intent to Detect Behavioral Regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18597v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software is evolving, code changes can introduce regression bugs or affect the behavior in other unintended ways. Traditional regression test generation is impractical for detecting unintended behavioral changes, because it reports all behavioral differences as potential regressions. However, most code changes are intended to change the behavior in some way, e.g., to fix a bug or to add a new feature. This paper presents Testora, the first automated approach that detects regressions by comparing the intentions of a code change against behavioral differences caused by the code change. Given a pull request (PR), Testora queries an LLM to generate tests that exercise the modified code, compares the behavior of the original and modified code, and classifies any behavioral differences as intended or unintended. For the classification, we present an LLM-based technique that leverages the natural language information associated with the PR, such as the title, description, and commit messages -- effectively using the natural language intent to detect behavioral regressions. Applying Testora to PRs of complex and popular Python projects, we find 19 regression bugs and 11 PRs that, despite having another intention, coincidentally fix a bug. Out of 13 regressions reported to the developers, 11 have been confirmed and 9 have already been fixed. The costs of using Testora are acceptable for real-world deployment, with 12.3 minutes to check a PR and LLM costs of only $0.003 per PR. We envision our approach to be used before or shortly after a code change gets merged into a code base, providing a way to early on detect regressions that are not caught by traditional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2026</p></details> |

However, few benchmarks directly evaluate this capability and current datasets often rely on artificial sources. We introduce EDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM code editing capabilities grounded in real-world usage, i.e., user instructions and code contexts collected in the wild. EDIT-Bench comprises of 545 problems, multiple natural and programming languages, and a diverse set of real-world use cases, ranging from resolving errors to adding features. EDIT-Bench introduces context-dependent problems that require the model to understand code context, highlighted code, and cursor position in addition to the user instruction. We evaluate 40 diverse LLMs and observe that EDIT-Bench is a challenging set of problems where only 5 models score over 60%. We find that model performance varies across different categories of user instructions. Further, we find that varying levels of contextual information greatly affect task success rate, with performance varying up to 11%, indicating the importance of evaluating with realistic context.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a reproducible demonstration system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI and LLM tools. Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138 repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects: repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48 hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Through machine learning models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify key predictors of viral growth. Posting timing appears as key factor--launching at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the "Show HN" tag shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. The demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware, automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations through single-file scripts. This makes our findings immediately reproducible and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures.

The Impact of LLM Agent Assistance on Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in their application to software development, with practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent assistant designers, and researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |

Synthesis-based engineering (SBE) is an approach to largely automate their design and implementation. SBE combines model-based engineering with computer-aided design, allowing engineers to focus on 'what' the system should do (the requirements) rather than 'how' it should do it (design and implementation). In the Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (ESCET) open-source project, a community of users, researchers, and tool vendors jointly develop a toolkit to support the entire SBE process, particularly through the CIF modeling language and tools. In this paper, we first provide a description of CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis algorithm, and thereby include aspects that are often omitted in the literature, but are of great practical relevance, such as the prevention of runtime errors, handling different types of requirements, and supporting input variables (to connect to external inputs). Secondly, we introduce and describe CIF's benchmark models, a collection of 23 freely available industrial and academic models of various sizes and complexities. Thirdly, we describe recent improvements between ESCET versions v0.8 (December 2022) and v4.0 (June 2024) that affect synthesis performance, evaluate them on our benchmark models, and show the current practical synthesis performance of CIF. Fourthly, we briefly look at multi-level synthesis, a non-monolithic synthesis approach, evaluate its gains, and show that while it can help to further improve synthesis performance, further performance improvements are still needed to synthesize complex models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Do LLMs Still Struggle? An In-Depth Analysis of Code Generation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04355v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code generation, and the race to improve their performance has become a central focus of AI research. Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular, offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our analysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track</p></details> |

As a result, cloud-native techniques, such as microservices and container orchestration, play an increasingly important role in their operation. However, orchestrating applications in a large-scale C-ITS poses unique challenges due to the dynamic nature of the environment and the need for efficient resource utilization. In this paper, we present a demand-driven application management approach that leverages cloud-native techniques - specifically Kubernetes - to address these challenges. Taking into account the demands originating from different entities within the C-ITS, the approach enables the automation of processes, such as deployment, reconfiguration, update, upgrade, and scaling of microservices. Executing these processes on demand can, for example, reduce computing resource consumption and network traffic. A demand may include a request for provisioning an external supporting service, such as a collective environment model. The approach handles changing and new demands by dynamically reconciling them through our proposed application management framework built on Kubernetes and the Robot Operating System (ROS 2). We demonstrate the operation of our framework in the C-ITS use case of collective environment perception and make the source code of the prototypical framework publicly available at https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/application_manager.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025), Gold Coast, Australia, November 18-21, 2025</p></details> |

Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</p></details> | Under review |

This fragmentation makes reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible research in LLM safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vibe Coding as a Reconfiguration of Intent Mediation in Software Development: Definition, Implications, and Research Agenda](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21928v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the software development process away from traditional areas such as design or technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pragmatic Reasoning improves LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15835v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in translating natural language (NL) instructions into program code. However, user instructions often contain inherent ambiguities, making it challenging for LLMs to generate code that accurately reflects the user's true intent. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed approaches that produce multiple candidates of the program code and then rerank them to identify the best solution. In this paper, we propose CodeRSA, a novel code candidate reranking mechanism built upon the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, designed to guide LLMs toward more comprehensive pragmatic reasoning about user intent. We evaluate CodeRSA using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct on two widely used code generation benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP. Our experiment results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into code candidate reranking, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tool for Benchmarking Large Language Models' Robustness in Assessing the Realism of Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04267v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, autonomous driving systems have made significant progress, yet ensuring their safety remains a key challenge. To this end, scenario-based testing offers a practical solution, and simulation-based methods have gained traction due to the high cost and risk of real-world testing. However, evaluating the realism of simulated scenarios remains difficult, creating demand for effective assessment methods. Recent advances show that Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, suggesting their potential in assessing scenario realism through scenario-related textual prompts. Motivated by this, we propose DriveRLR, a benchmark tool to assess the robustness of LLMs in evaluating the realism of driving scenarios. DriveRLR generates mutated scenario variants, constructs prompts, which are then used to assess a given LLM's ability and robustness in determining the realism of driving scenarios. We validate DriveRLR on the DeepScenario dataset using three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-5, Llama 4 Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2. Results show that DriveRLR effectively reveals differences in the robustness of various LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical value in scenario realism assessment. Beyond LLM robustness evaluation, DriveRLR can serve as a practical component in applications such as an objective function to guide scenario generation, supporting simulation-based ADS testing workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test smells in LLM-Generated Unit Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10628v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs promise to transform unit test generation from a manual burden into an automated solution. Yet, beyond metrics such as compilability or coverage, little is known about the quality of LLM-generated tests, particularly their susceptibility to test smells, design flaws that undermine readability and maintainability. This paper presents the first multi-benchmark, large-scale analysis of test smell diffusion in LLM-generated unit tests. We contrast LLM outputs with human-written suites (as the reference for real-world practices) and SBST-generated tests from EvoSuite (as the automated baseline), disentangling whether LLMs reproduce human-like flaws or artifacts of synthetic generation. Our study draws on 20,505 class-level suites from four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B), 972 method-level cases from TestBench, 14,469 EvoSuite tests, and 779,585 human-written tests from 34,635 open-source Java projects. Using two complementary detection tools (TsDetect and JNose), we analyze prevalence, co-occurrence, and correlations with software attributes and generation parameters. Results show that LLM-generated tests consistently manifest smells such as Assertion Roulette and Magic Number Test, with patterns strongly influenced by prompting strategy, context length, and model scale. Comparisons reveal overlaps with human-written tests, raising concerns of potential data leakage from training corpora while EvoSuite exhibits distinct, generator-specific flaws. These findings highlight both the promise and the risks of LLM-based test generation, and call for the design of smell-aware generation frameworks, prompt engineering strategies, and enhanced detection tools to ensure maintainable, high-quality test code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterising Global Platforms: Centralised, Decentralised, Federated, and Grassroots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03286v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global digital platforms are software systems designed to serve entire populations, with some already serving billions of people. We propose atomic transactions-based multiagent transition systems and protocols as a formal framework to study them; introduce essential agents -- minimal sets of agents the removal of which makes communication impossible; and show that the cardinality of essential agents partitions all global platforms into four classes: 1. Centralised -- one (the server) 2. Decentralised -- finite $>1$ (bootstrap nodes) 3. Federated -- infinite but not universal (all servers) 4. Grassroots -- universal (all agents) Our illustrative formal example is a global social network, for which we provide centralised, decentralised, federated, and grassroots specifications via multiagent atomic transactions, and prove they all satisfy the same basic correctness properties. We discuss informally additional global platforms -- currencies, ``sharing economy'' apps, AI, and more. While this may be the first characterisation of centralised, decentralised, and federated global platforms, grassroots platforms have been formally defined previously, but using different notions. Here, we prove that their original definition implies that all agents are essential, placing grassroots platforms in a distinct class within the broader formal context that includes all global platforms. This work provides the first mathematical framework for classifying any global platform -- existing or imagined -- by providing a multiagent atomic-transactions specification of it and determining the cardinality of the minimal set of essential agents in the ensuing multiagent protocol. It thus provides a unifying mathematical approach for the study of global digital platforms, perhaps the most important class of computer systems today.</p></details> |  |

It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty trade-offs.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach replaces traditional APIs and message brokers with a Git-based communication model built on the principles of Kubernetes Operators and Custom Resources (CRs). Each participating entity, designated as a Publisher or Consumer, interacts through a shared repository that serves as a single source of truth, where the spec field captures the desired state and the status field reflects the observed outcome. This pattern extends GitOps beyond infrastructure management to support cross-domain, inter-organizational, and air-gapped collaboration scenarios. By leveraging Git native features (versioning, commit signing, and access control) the model ensures transparency, traceability, and reproducibility while preserving loose coupling and autonomy between systems. The paper discusses architectural principles, implementation considerations, and comparisons with RESTful and broker-based integrations, highlighting both the advantages and trade-offs of adopting Git as a declarative communication substrate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining Software Vulnerabilities with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04179v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalence of security vulnerabilities has prompted companies to adopt static application security testing (SAST) tools for vulnerability detection. Nevertheless, these tools frequently exhibit usability limitations, as their generic warning messages do not sufficiently communicate important information to developers, resulting in misunderstandings or oversight of critical findings. In light of recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their text generation capabilities, our work investigates a hybrid approach that uses LLMs to tackle the SAST explainability challenges. In this paper, we present SAFE, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin that leverages GPT-4o to explain the causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies of vulnerabilities detected by SAST tools. Our expert user study findings indicate that the explanations generated by SAFE can significantly assist beginner to intermediate developers in understanding and addressing security vulnerabilities, thereby improving the overall usability of SAST tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are We Aligned? A Preliminary Investigation of the Alignment of Responsible AI Values between LLMs and Human Judgment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04157v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation, raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs' value preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3) resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4), revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Natural Language Proficiency Shapes GenAI Code for Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04115v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Foundation Model (FM)-powered tools in software engineering, the natural language prompt has become a critical interface between developers and Large Language Models (LLMs). While much research has focused on prompt structure, the natural language proficiency is an underexplored factor that can influence the quality of generated code. This paper investigates whether the English language proficiency itself independent of the prompting technique affects the proficiency and correctness of code generated by LLMs. Using the HumanEval dataset, we systematically varied the English proficiency of prompts from basic to advanced for 164 programming tasks and measured the resulting code proficiency and correctness. Our findings show that LLMs default to an intermediate (B2) natural language level. While the effect on the resulting code proficiency was model-dependent, we found that higher-proficiency prompts consistently yielded more correct code across all models. These results demonstrate that natural language proficiency is a key lever for controlling code generation, helping developers tailor AI output and improve the reliability of solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, the scientific evaluation of these systems is hampered by significant challenges, including overly simplistic benchmarks and the difficulty of conducting fair comparisons between different agent architectures due to confounding implementation variables. To address these limitations, we first construct a challenging and dynamically curated E2EDevBench to simulate realistic development scenarios. Second, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework that combines test-case-based functional assessment with fine-grained, LLM-based requirement verification. Using this framework, we conduct a controlled empirical study on three representative agent architectures implemented upon a unified foundation to isolate the impact of workflow design. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art agents can fulfill approximately 50\% of requirements on \bench{}, but their success is critically dependent on the architectural strategy for task decomposition and collaboration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the primary bottleneck is the omission of requirements and inadequate self-verification. This work provides the community with a more realistic benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and crucial insights into the current capabilities and core challenges of software development agents, guiding future research toward enhancing requirement comprehension and planning.</p></details> |  |

We present \textsc{AdaTaint}, an LLM-driven taint analysis framework that adaptively infers source/sink specifications and filters spurious alerts through neuro-symbolic reasoning. Unlike LLM-only detectors, \textsc{AdaTaint} grounds model suggestions in program facts and constraint validation, ensuring both adaptability and determinism. We evaluate \textsc{AdaTaint} on Juliet 1.3, SV-COMP-style C benchmarks, and three large real-world projects. Results show that \textsc{AdaTaint} reduces false positives by \textbf{43.7\%} on average and improves recall by \textbf{11.2\%} compared to state-of-the-art baselines (CodeQL, Joern, and LLM-only pipelines), while maintaining competitive runtime overhead. These findings demonstrate that combining LLM inference with symbolic validation offers a practical path toward more accurate and reliable static vulnerability analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specification-Guided Vulnerability Detection with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04014v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code understanding tasks. However, they demonstrate limited performance in vulnerability detection and struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from patched code. We argue that LLMs lack understanding of security specifications -- the expectations about how code should behave to remain safe. When code behavior differs from these expectations, it becomes a potential vulnerability. However, such knowledge is rarely explicit in training data, leaving models unable to reason about security flaws. We propose VulInstruct, a specification-guided approach that systematically extracts security specifications from historical vulnerabilities to detect new ones. VulInstruct constructs a specification knowledge base from two perspectives: (i) General specifications from high-quality patches across projects, capturing fundamental safe behaviors; and (ii) Domain-specific specifications from repeated violations in particular repositories relevant to the target code. VulInstruct retrieves relevant past cases and specifications, enabling LLMs to reason about expected safe behaviors rather than relying on surface patterns. We evaluate VulInstruct under strict criteria requiring both correct predictions and valid reasoning. On PrimeVul, VulInstruct achieves 45.0% F1-score (32.7% improvement) and 37.7% recall (50.8% improvement) compared to baselines, while uniquely detecting 24.3% of vulnerabilities -- 2.4x more than any baseline. In pair-wise evaluation, VulInstruct achieves 32.3% relative improvement. VulInstruct also discovered a previously unknown high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-56538) in production code, demonstrating practical value for real-world vulnerability discovery. All code and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/zhuhaopku/VulInstruct-temp.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often suffer from structural inconsistencies, asset misalignment, and limited production readiness. This paper presents PSD2Code, a novel multi-modal approach that leverages PSD file parsing and asset alignment to generate production-ready React+SCSS code. Our method introduces a ParseAlignGenerate pipeline that extracts hierarchical structures, layer properties, and metadata from PSD files, providing large language models with precise spatial relationships and semantic groupings for frontend code generation. The system employs a constraint-based alignment strategy that ensures consistency between generated elements and design resources, while a structured prompt construction enhances controllability and code quality. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods across multiple metrics including code similarity, visual fidelity, and production readiness. The method exhibits strong model independence across different large language models, validating the effectiveness of integrating structured design information with multimodal large language models for industrial-grade code generation, marking an important step toward design-driven automated frontend development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secret Breach Prevention in Software Issue Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23657v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the digital era, accidental exposure of sensitive information such as API keys, tokens, and credentials is a growing security threat. While most prior work focuses on detecting secrets in source code, leakage in software issue reports remains largely unexplored. This study fills that gap through a large-scale analysis and a practical detection pipeline for exposed secrets in GitHub issues. Our pipeline combines regular expression-based extraction with large language model (LLM) based contextual classification to detect real secrets and reduce false positives. We build a benchmark of 54,148 instances from public GitHub issues, including 5,881 manually verified true secrets. Using this dataset, we evaluate entropy-based baselines and keyword heuristics used by prior secret detection tools, classical machine learning, deep learning, and LLM-based methods. Regex and entropy based approaches achieve high recall but poor precision, while smaller models such as RoBERTa and CodeBERT greatly improve performance (F1 = 92.70%). Proprietary models like GPT-4o perform moderately in few-shot settings (F1 = 80.13%), and fine-tuned open-source larger LLMs such as Qwen and LLaMA reach up to 94.49% F1. Finally, we also validate our approach on 178 real-world GitHub repositories, achieving an F1-score of 81.6% which demonstrates our approach's strong ability to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A key feature of the proposed flow is the progressive error feedback system of agents (PEFA), a self-correcting mechanism that leverages iterative error feedback to progressively increase the complexity of the approach. The generated RTL includes checks for compilation, functional correctness, and synthesizable constructs. To validate this adaptive approach to code generation, benchmarking is performed using two opensource natural language-to-RTL datasets. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach implemented on an open source agentic framework, using both open- and closed-source LLMs, effectively bridging the performance gap between them. Compared to previously published methods, our approach sets a new benchmark, providing state-of-the-art pass rates while being efficient in token counts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in the Design Automation Conference (DAC) 2025, Workshop Poster on June 22, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Agents for Automated Program Repair in Ruby](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03925v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced rapidly with Large Language Models (LLMs), but most existing methods remain computationally expensive, and focused on a small set of languages. Ruby, despite its widespread use in web development and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received little attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel lightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven, iterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that generate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a correct solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid reliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead operating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven feedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a pass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly within five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and self-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that RAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors, and runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair strategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging tools to under-studied languages.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate secure code generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach. Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from 70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the benefits.

This is especially true for foundational libraries, which are hidden below packages visible to the users (and thus doubly hidden, since even the packages directly used in research are frequently not visible in the paper).

In this work, we use the CZ Software Mentions Dataset to map the upstream dependencies of software used in biomedical papers and find the packages critical to scientific software ecosystems. We propose centrality metrics for the network of software dependencies, analyze three ecosystems (PyPi, CRAN, Bioconductor), and determine the packages with the highest centrality.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables.

We will only achieve this betterment if we manage to transfer the knowledge acquired during research into practice. This transferal of knowledge may come in the form of tools, processes, and guidelines for software developers. However, the value of these contributions hinges on the assumption that applying them causes an improvement of the development process, user experience, or other performance metrics. Such a promise requires evidence of causal relationships between an exposure or intervention (i.e., the contributed tool, process or guideline) and an outcome (i.e., performance metrics). A straight-forward approach to obtaining this evidence is via controlled experiments in which a sample of a population is randomly divided into a group exposed to the new tool, process, or guideline, and a control group. However, such randomized control trials may not be legally, ethically, or logistically feasible. In these cases, we need a reliable process for statistical causal inference (SCI) from observational data.</p></details> |  |
| **[The OpenHands Software Agent SDK: A Composable and Extensible Foundation for Production Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03690v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents are now used widely in the process of software development, but building production-ready software engineering agents is a complex task. Deploying software agents effectively requires flexibility in implementation and experimentation, reliable and secure execution, and interfaces for users to interact with agents. In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent SDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these desiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent components of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents, which has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple interface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the default case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents with features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security and reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability, integrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can connect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS Code, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing SDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native sandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and built-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow the OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for prototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably deploying agents at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Cross-Platform Execution Engine for the Quantum Intermediate Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14299v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid languages like the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) are essential for programming systems that mix quantum and conventional computing models, while execution of these programs is often deferred to a system-specific implementation. Here, we develop the QIR Execution Engine (QIR-EE) for parsing, interpreting, and executing QIR across multiple hardware platforms. QIR-EE uses LLVM to execute hybrid instructions specifying quantum programs and, by design, presents extension points that support customized runtime and hardware environments. We demonstrate an implementation that uses the XACC quantum hardware-accelerator library to dispatch prototypical quantum programs on different commercial quantum platforms and numerical simulators, and we validate execution of QIR-EE on IonQ, Quantinuum, and IBM hardware. Our results highlight the efficiency of hybrid executable architectures for handling mixed instructions, managing mixed data, and integrating with quantum computing frameworks to realize cross-platform execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages with corresponding code freely available at https://github.com/ORNL-QCI/qiree</p></details> |
| **[HAFixAgent: History-Aware Automated Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01047v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has recently shifted toward large language models and agent-based systems, yet most systems rely on local snapshot context, overlooking repository history. Prior work shows that repository history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

While neural click models have emerged over the past decade, complex click models based on probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have not systematically adopted gradient-based optimization, preventing practitioners from leveraging modern deep learning frameworks while preserving the interpretability of classic models. CLAX addresses this gap by replacing EM-based optimization with direct gradient-based optimization in a numerically stable manner. The framework's modular design enables the integration of any component, from embeddings and deep networks to custom modules, into classic click models for end-to-end optimization. We demonstrate CLAX's efficiency by running experiments on the full Baidu-ULTR dataset comprising over a billion user sessions in $\approx$ 2 hours on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster than traditional EM approaches. CLAX implements ten classic click models, serving both industry practitioners seeking to understand user behavior and improve ranking performance at scale and researchers developing new click models.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating code explanations, they often lack grounding in the broader software engineering context. We propose a novel approach that leverages natural language artifacts from GitHub -- such as pull request descriptions, issue descriptions and discussions, and commit messages -- to enhance LLM-based code understanding. Our system consists of three components: one that extracts and structures relevant GitHub context, another that uses this context to generate high-level explanations of the code's purpose, and a third that validates the explanation. We implemented this as a standalone tool, as well as a server within the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling integration with other AI-assisted development tools. Our main use case is that of enhancing a standard LLM-based code explanation with code insights that our system generates. To evaluate explanations' quality, we conducted a small scale user study, with developers of several open projects, as well as developers of proprietary projects. Our user study indicates that when insights are generated they often are helpful and non trivial, and are free from hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in AISM 2025, see https://aism25.github.io/aism25/</p></details> |
| **[Investigating the Impact of Isolation on Synchronized Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03533v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking in cloud environments suffers from performance variability from multi-tenant resource contention. Duet benchmarking mitigates this by running two workload versions concurrently on the same VM, exposing them to identical external interference. However, intra-VM contention between synchronized workloads necessitates additional isolation mechanisms. This work evaluates three such strategies: cgroups and CPU pinning, Docker containers, and Firecracker MicroVMs. We compare all strategies with an unisolated baseline experiment, by running benchmarks with a duet setup alongside a noise generator. This noise generator "steals" compute resources to degrade performance measurements. All experiments showed different latency distributions while under the effects of noise generation, but results show that process isolation generally lowered false positives, except for our experiments with Docker containers. Even though Docker containers rely internally on cgroups and CPU pinning, they were more susceptible to performance degradation due to noise influence. Therefore, we recommend to use process isolation for synchronized workloads, with the exception of Docker containers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing</p></details> |

This limitation is evident in open-world software environments, where emerging challenges transcend established paradigms. We propose U2F (Unknown Unknowns to Functional solutions), a cognitive-inspired, uncertainty-embracing multi-agent framework that systematically surfaces "Unknown Unknowns" - novel solution pathways absent from initial formulations but holding innovative potential. U2F consists of two key components: (1) a Discovery-Exploration-Integration agent system for uncovering and synthesizing potential solutions, and (2) cognitive enhancement mechanisms across three dimensions: cross-domain analogical reasoning, reverse thinking, and external validation, which strategically reframe and extend conventional solution boundaries. Applied to 218 real-world software enabler stories curated from authentic engineering tasks, U2F achieved notable improvements: human experts reported a 14 percent increase in overall novelty, 51 percent improvement in semantic novelty, and stable feasibility (4.02/5.0), corroborated by an LLM-based evaluator. These results highlight the potential of embracing uncertainty as a catalyst for innovation in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROSBag MCP Server: Analyzing Robot Data with LLMs for Agentic Embodied AI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

Much existing work has relied on manual quantification, which is expensive and error-prone due to the imprecision. In this paper, we present LQPR, a highly efficient automatic approach for performance requirements quantification.LQPR relies on a new theoretical framework that converts quantification as a classification problem. Despite the prevalent applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) for requirement analytics, LQPR takes a different perspective to address the classification: we observed that performance requirements can exhibit strong patterns and are often short/concise, therefore we design a lightweight linguistically induced matching mechanism. We compare LQPR against nine state-of-the-art learning-based approaches over diverse datasets, demonstrating that it is ranked as the sole best for 75% or more cases with two orders less cost. Our work proves that, at least for performance requirement quantification, specialized methods can be more suitable than the general LLM-driven approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Realistic Project-Level Code Generation via Multi-Agent Collaboration and Semantic Architecture Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03404v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in automated code generation. In real-world software engineering, the growing demand for rapid iteration and continuous delivery underscores the importance of project-level code generation, where LLMs are expected to generate complete software projects directly from complex user requirements. Although existing studies have made initial explorations, they still face key limitations, including unrealistic datasets and unreliable evaluation metrics that fail to reflect real-world complexity, the semantic gap between human-written requirements and machine-interpretable structures, and difficulties in managing hierarchical dependencies and maintaining quality throughout the generation process. To address these limitations, we first introduce CodeProjectEval, a project-level code generation dataset built from 18 real-world repositories with 12.7 files and 2,388.6 lines of code per task on average, supplemented with documentation and executable test cases for automatic evaluation. We further propose ProjectGen, a multi-agent framework that decomposes projects into architecture design, skeleton generation, and code filling stages with iterative refinement and memory-based context management. Within this framework, we introduce the Semantic Software Architecture Tree (SSAT), a structured and semantically rich representation that effectively bridges user requirements and source code implementation. Experiments show that ProjectGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, passing 52/124 test cases on the small-scale project-level code generation dataset DevBench, a 57% improvement over the baseline approaches, and 310 test cases on CodeProjectEval, representing an improvement of roughly tenfold compared to the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrity Under Siege: A Rogue gNodeB's Manipulation of 5G Network Slice Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03312v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of 5G networks, with network slicing as a cornerstone technology, promises customized, high-performance services, but also introduces novel attack surfaces beyond traditional threats. This article investigates a critical and underexplored integrity vulnerability: the manipulation of network slice allocation to compromise Quality of Service (QoS) and resource integrity. We introduce a threat model, grounded in a risk analysis of permissible yet insecure configurations like null-ciphering (5G-EA0), demonstrating how a rogue gNodeB acting as a Man-in-the-Middle can exploit protocol weaknesses to forge slice requests and hijack a User Equipment's (UE) connection. Through a comprehensive experimental evaluation on a 5G testbed, we demonstrate the attack's versatile and severe impacts. Our findings show this integrity breach can manifest as obvious QoS degradation, such as a 95% bandwidth reduction and 150% latency increase when forcing UE to a suboptimal slice, or as stealthy slice manipulation that is indistinguishable from benign network operation and generates no core network errors. Furthermore, we validate a systemic resource contamination attack where redirecting a crowd of UE orchestrates a Denial-of-Service, causing packet loss to exceed 60% and inducing measurable CPU saturation (~80%) on core network User Plane Functions (UPFs). Based on these results, we discuss the profound implications for Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and critical infrastructure. We propose concrete, cross-layer mitigation strategies for network operators as future work, underscoring the urgent need to secure the integrity of dynamic resource management in 5G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, Elsevier journal paper layout</p></details> |

Although RE is fundamental to software engineering, limited research has examined AI adoption in RE. We surveyed 55 software practitioners to map AI usage across four RE phases: Elicitation, Analysis, Specification, and Validation, and four approaches for decision making: human-only decisions, AI validation, Human AI Collaboration (HAIC), and full AI automation. Participants also shared their perceptions, challenges, and opportunities when applying AI for RE tasks. Our data show that 58.2% of respondents already use AI in RE, and 69.1% view its impact as positive or very positive. HAIC dominates practice, accounting for 54.4% of all RE techniques, while full AI automation remains minimal at 5.4%. Passive AI validation (4.4 to 6.2%) lags even further behind, indicating that practitioners value AI's active support over passive oversight. These findings suggest that AI is most effective when positioned as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human expertise. It also highlights the need for RE-specific HAIC frameworks along with robust and responsible AI governance as AI adoption in RE grows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Intelligent Software Engineering (ISE) 2025 Workshop at the Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

However, C# -- a prominent enterprise language ranking #5 in the TIOBE index -- remains absent from such benchmarks. We introduce SWE-Sharp-Bench, a reproducible software engineering benchmark for C# featuring 150 instances from 17 repositories. Evaluating identical model-agent configurations across languages reveals a significant performance gap: while 70% of Python tasks in SWE-Bench Verified are solved, only 40% of our C# tasks are resolved. We open-source SWE-Sharp-Bench and our entire curation pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven Collaborative Model for Untangling Commits via Explicit and Implicit Dependency Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16395v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomic commits, which address a single development concern, are a best practice in software development. In practice, however, developers often produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes, complicating code review and maintenance. Prior untangling approaches (rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based) have made progress but typically rely on shallow signals and struggle to distinguish explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) from implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture structural and contextual information, we construct Explicit and Implicit Contexts, enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 82% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Robustness of Model Editing in Code LLMs: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03182v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development. However, while LLMs remain static after pretraining, programming languages and APIs continue to evolve, leading to the generation of deprecated or incompatible code that undermines reliability. Retraining LLMs from scratch to reflect such changes is computationally expensive, making model editing a promising lightweight alternative that updates only a small subset of parameters. Despite its potential, it remains unclear whether model editing yields genuine syntactic and semantic adaptations or merely superficial fixes. In this work, we present a systematic study of five state-of-the-art model editing methods: Constrained Fine-Tuning (FT), GRACE, MEMIT, PMET, and ROME. We apply these methods to three leading open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeQwen1.5, and DeepSeek-Coder, under controlled API deprecation scenarios. Our evaluation covers both instant and sequential editing settings, using three disjoint evaluation sets designed to assess reliability, generalization, and specificity. We measure model correctness at three levels: successful compilation, partial test case pass, and full test pass. Our findings show that instant edits consistently degrade model performance, with syntactic validity dropping by up to 86 percentage points and functional correctness declining by 45 points even in the best-performing setting. Sequential edits further amplify this degradation, and in some cases, model performance collapses entirely. Across all models, most passing generations relied on workarounds rather than correctly adopting the intended changes, while faulty adoptions that result in test failures or compilation errors were significantly more frequent. Correct adoptions, where the model correctly integrates the intended change, occurred in only about 6% of cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 2 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |

We propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that generates energy-efficient parallel codes through a multi-stage, iterative approach integrating runtime power profiling, energy-aware prompting, self-correcting feedback loops, and an LLM-as-a-Judge agent for automated screening of code solutions. We introduce energy-reduction@k, a novel metric that quantifies expected energy reduction when generating k code candidates and selecting the most energy-efficient, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-attempt generation strategies. Evaluating 20 HeCBench applications and two miniApps on NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI100 GPUs, a single run (k=1) with LASSI-EE delivers refactored parallel codes with an average 29% expected energy reduction at an 81% pass rate, representing a 2.8x improvement over vanilla LLM prompting. Multiple runs (k=3) achieve an average 48% expected energy reduction at a 97% pass rate. These results are consistent across devices, demonstrating LASSI-EE's effectiveness across diverse hardware architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, version under review at a peer-reviewed conference</p></details> |
| **[RefAgent: A Multi-agent LLM-based Framework for Automatic Software Refactoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03153v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially influenced various software engineering tasks. Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional LLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code quality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for specific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving contexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and executing workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce RefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software refactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning, executing, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection and tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java projects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a search-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our assessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software quality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the contribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that RefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a median of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a median of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and the search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a median F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent approaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the median compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise of multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Dependency-Aware Code Generation from Enhanced UML Sequence Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03379v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language (NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Prompt Generation for Code Intelligence: An Empirical study and Experience in WeChat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03136v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Code Models (LCMs) show potential in code intelligence, but their effectiveness is greatly influenced by prompt quality. Current prompt design is mostly manual, which is time-consuming and highly dependent on specific LCMs and tasks. While automated prompt generation (APG) exists in NLP, it is underexplored for code intelligence. This creates a gap, as automating the prompt process is essential for developers facing diverse tasks and black-box LCMs. To mitigate this, we empirically investigate two important parts of APG: Instruction Generation (IG) and Multi-Step Reasoning (MSR). IG provides a task-related description to instruct LCMs, while MSR guides them to produce logical steps before the final answer. We evaluate widely-used APG methods for each part on four open-source LCMs and three code intelligence tasks: code translation (PL-PL), code summarization (PL-NL), and API recommendation (NL-PL).Experimental results indicate that both IG and MSR dramatically enhance performance compared to basic prompts. Based on these results, we propose a novel APG approach combining the best methods of the two parts. Experiments show our approach achieves average improvements of 28.38% in CodeBLEU (code translation), 58.11% in ROUGE-L (code summarization), and 84.53% in SuccessRate@1 (API recommendation) over basic prompts. To validate its effectiveness in an industrial scenario, we evaluate our approach on WeChat-Bench, a proprietary dataset, achieving an average MRR improvement of 148.89% for API recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

To mitigate this problem, this work proposes an adaptive approach based on machine learning for software aging detection in environments subject to dynamic workload conditions. We evaluate and compare a static model with adaptive models that incorporate adaptive detectors, specifically the Drift Detection Method (DDM) and Adaptive Windowing (ADWIN), originally developed for concept drift scenarios and applied in this work to handle workload shifts. Experiments with simulated sudden, gradual, and recurring workload transitions show that static models suffer a notable performance drop when applied to unseen workload profiles, whereas the adaptive model with ADWIN maintains high accuracy, achieving an F1-Score above 0.93 in all analyzed scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIMP\...</summary><p>SIMP\'OSIO EM SISTEMAS COMPUTACIONAIS DE ALTO DESEMPENHO (SSCAD)</p></details> |

Creating rigorous ACs is particularly challenging in the context of software product lines (SPLs), i.e, sets of software products with overlapping but distinct features and behaviours. Since SPLs can encompass very large numbers of products, developing a rigorous AC for each product individually is infeasible. Moreover, if the SPL evolves, e.g., by the modification or introduction of features, it can be infeasible to assess the impact of this change. Instead, the development and maintenance of ACs ought to be lifted such that a single AC can be developed for the entire SPL simultaneously, and be analyzed for regression in a variability-aware fashion. In this article, we describe a formal approach to lifted AC development and regression analysis. We formalize a language of variability-aware ACs for SPLs and study the lifting of template-based AC development. We also define a regression analysis to determine the effects of SPL evolutions on variability-aware ACs.

This gap between benchmark performance and practical utility raises critical questions about LLMs' readiness for production code assistance, particularly regarding their ability to generalize across familiar and novel codebases. We introduce a benchmark derived from real-world open-source repositories, comprising classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization under practical conditions. We systematically examine how input specification completeness and retrieval-augmented generation affect class-level correctness across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals a substantial performance gap: while LLMs achieve 84 to 89% correctness on synthetic benchmarks, they attain only 25 to 34% on real-world class tasks, with minimal distinction between familiar and novel codebases. Comprehensive documentation provides marginal improvements (1 to 3%), whereas retrieval augmentation yields greater gains (4 to 7%) by supplying concrete implementation patterns. Error analysis identifies AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes, with distinct patterns between synthetic and real-world scenarios. These findings provide actionable insights for enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval integration in production code assistance tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print submitted for reviwer to TOSEM</p></details> |
| **[Toward an Agricultural Operational Design Domain: A Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02937v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The agricultural sector increasingly relies on autonomous systems that operate in complex and variable environments. Unlike on-road applications, agricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which imposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring consistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a structured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However, existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique challenges of agricultural applications. Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework, which can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of autonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core elements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured method for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters using concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model derived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process layer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative verification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical scenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness and consistency. Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD Framework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Risk Estimation in Differential Fuzzing via Extreme Value Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02927v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing is a highly effective technique for automatically detecting software bugs and vulnerabilities when the specifications involve an analysis over multiple executions simultaneously. Differential fuzzing, in particular, operates as a guided randomized search, aiming to find (similar) inputs that lead to a maximum difference in software outputs or their behaviors. However, fuzzing, as a dynamic analysis, lacks any guarantees on the absence of bugs: from a differential fuzzing campaign that has observed no bugs (or a minimal difference), what is the risk of observing a bug (or a larger difference) if we run the fuzzer for one or more steps? This paper investigates the application of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to address the risk of missing or underestimating bugs in differential fuzzing. The key observation is that differential fuzzing as a random process resembles the maximum distribution of observed differences. Hence, EVT, a branch of statistics dealing with extreme values, is an ideal framework to analyze the tail of the differential fuzzing campaign to contain the risk. We perform experiments on a set of real-world Java libraries and use differential fuzzing to find information leaks via side channels in these libraries. We first explore the feasibility of EVT for this task and the optimal hyperparameters for EVT distributions. We then compare EVT-based extrapolation against baseline statistical methods like Markov's as well as Chebyshev's inequalities, and the Bayes factor. EVT-based extrapolations outperform the baseline techniques in 14.3% of cases and tie with the baseline in 64.2% of cases. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy and performance gains of EVT-enabled differential fuzzing in real-world Java libraries, where we reported an average saving of tens of millions of bytecode executions by an early stop.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 25), 13 Pages, 4 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

We exploit the modular structure of the plant to be controlled, given as a set of labelled transition systems (LTS), to mitigate state explosion that monolithic approaches to synthesis are prone to. Maximally permissive safe controllers are iteratively built for subsets of the plant LTSs by solving weaker control problems. Observational synthesis equivalence is used to reduce the size of the controlled subset of the plant by abstracting away local events. The result of synthesis is also compositional, a set of controllers that when run in parallel ensure the LTL goal. We implement synthesis in the MTSA tool for an expressive subset of LTL, GR(1), and show it computes solutions to that can be up to 1000 times larger than those that the monolithic approach can solve.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in CAV25</p></details> |

Generative AI (GenAI) coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot have been shown to improve developer productivity, but their impact on code understanding is less clear. We replicate and extend a previous study by exploring both performance and comprehension in GenAI-assisted brownfield programming tasks. In a within-subjects experimental study, 18 computer science graduate students completed feature implementation tasks with and without Copilot. Results show that Copilot significantly reduced task time and increased the number of test cases passed. However, comprehension scores did not differ across conditions, revealing a comprehension-performance gap: participants passed more test cases with Copilot, but did not demonstrate greater understanding of the legacy codebase. Moreover, we failed to find a correlation between comprehension and task performance. These findings suggest that while GenAI tools can accelerate programming progress in a legacy codebase, such progress may come without an improved understanding of that codebase. We consider the implications of these findings for programming education and GenAI tool design.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[From Code Changes to Quality Gains: An Empirical Study in Python ML Systems with PyQu](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02827v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS), software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners, educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Formalizing Regression Testing for Agile and Continuous Integration Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02810v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software developed using modern agile practices delivers a stream of software versions that require continuous regression testing rather than testing once close to the delivery or maintenance phase, as assumed by classical regression-testing theory. In this work, we formalize the phenomenon of continuous or near-continuous regression testing using successive builds as a time-ordered chain, where each build contains the program, requirements, and the accompanying tests. We also formalize the regression test window between any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for the classical two-version case. The formalization is validated by directly representing two state-of-the-art agile regression testing algorithms in terms of build-tuple operations without requiring auxiliary assumptions, followed by proof of the soundness and completeness of our formalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the first attempt to formalize regression testing in agile context as a continuous/near-continuos activity.

| **[Investigating the Experience of Autistic Individuals in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02736v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) leads to various issues in the everyday life of autistic individuals, often resulting in unemployment and mental health problems. To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants. We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance. Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReleaseEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in Automated Release Note Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02713v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated release note generation addresses the challenge of documenting frequent software updates, where manual efforts are time-consuming and prone to human error. Although recent advances in language models further enhance this process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and (3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs. Both automated and human evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while still struggling on diff2sum. These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting from long code diffs.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |
| **[Code Review Automation using Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05302v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but is labor-intensive. Automated code review generation offers a promising solution to this challenge. Both deep learning-based generative techniques and retrieval-based methods have demonstrated strong performance in this task. However, despite these advancements, there are still some limitations where generated reviews can be either off-point or overly general. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reviewer (RARe), which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine retrieval-based and generative methods, explicitly incorporating external domain knowledge into the code review process. RARe uses a dense retriever to select the most relevant reviews from the codebase, which then enrich the input for a neural generator, utilizing the contextual learning capacity of large language models (LLMs), to produce the final review. RARe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 12.32 and 12.96, respectively. Its effectiveness is further validated through a detailed human evaluation and a case study using an interpretability tool, demonstrating its practical utility and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Software Architecture Description from Source Code using Reverse Engineering and Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05165v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chasing One-day Vulnerabilities Across Open Source Forks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05097v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking vulnerabilities inherited from third-party open-source components is a well-known challenge, often addressed by tracing the threads of dependency information. However, vulnerabilities can also propagate through forking: a repository forked after the introduction of a vulnerability, but before it is patched, may remain vulnerable in the fork well after being fixed in the original project. Current approaches for vulnerability analysis lack the commit-level granularity needed to track vulnerability introductions and fixes across forks, potentially leaving one-day vulnerabilities undetected. This paper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day vulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public code, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates vulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact analysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not incorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162 repositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their development histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one vulnerable commit. Then we perform a strict filtering, allowing us to find 356 ___vulnerability, fork___ pairs impacting active and popular GitHub forks, we manually evaluate 65 pairs, finding 3 high-severity vulnerabilities, demonstrating the impact and applicability of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Is Self-admitted Code Generated by Large Language Models on GitHub?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19544v4)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has garnered significant attention from researchers evaluating the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for code generation. However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which do not adequately capture the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To address this gap, our study investigates self-admitted code generated by LLMs on GitHub, specifically focusing on instances where developers in projects with over five stars acknowledge the use of LLMs to generate code through code comments. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot dominate code generation, with minimal contributions from other LLMs. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code appears in small/medium-sized projects led by small teams, which are continuously evolving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally is a minor project portion, primarily generating short/moderate-length, low-complexity snippets (e.g., algorithms and data structures code; text processing code). (4) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally undergoes minimal modifications, with bug-related changes ranging from 4% to 12%. (5) Most code comments only state LLM use, while few include details like prompts, human edits, or code testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code generation, and evaluation scripts are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NLPForUA/ua-code-bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Testora: Using Natural Language Intent to Detect Behavioral Regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18597v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software is evolving, code changes can introduce regression bugs or affect the behavior in other unintended ways. Traditional regression test generation is impractical for detecting unintended behavioral changes, because it reports all behavioral differences as potential regressions. However, most code changes are intended to change the behavior in some way, e.g., to fix a bug or to add a new feature. This paper presents Testora, the first automated approach that detects regressions by comparing the intentions of a code change against behavioral differences caused by the code change. Given a pull request (PR), Testora queries an LLM to generate tests that exercise the modified code, compares the behavior of the original and modified code, and classifies any behavioral differences as intended or unintended. For the classification, we present an LLM-based technique that leverages the natural language information associated with the PR, such as the title, description, and commit messages -- effectively using the natural language intent to detect behavioral regressions. Applying Testora to PRs of complex and popular Python projects, we find 19 regression bugs and 11 PRs that, despite having another intention, coincidentally fix a bug. Out of 13 regressions reported to the developers, 11 have been confirmed and 9 have already been fixed. The costs of using Testora are acceptable for real-world deployment, with 12.3 minutes to check a PR and LLM costs of only $0.003 per PR. We envision our approach to be used before or shortly after a code change gets merged into a code base, providing a way to early on detect regressions that are not caught by traditional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2026</p></details> |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |

Synthesis-based engineering (SBE) is an approach to largely automate their design and implementation. SBE combines model-based engineering with computer-aided design, allowing engineers to focus on 'what' the system should do (the requirements) rather than 'how' it should do it (design and implementation). In the Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (ESCET) open-source project, a community of users, researchers, and tool vendors jointly develop a toolkit to support the entire SBE process, particularly through the CIF modeling language and tools. In this paper, we first provide a description of CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis algorithm, and thereby include aspects that are often omitted in the literature, but are of great practical relevance, such as the prevention of runtime errors, handling different types of requirements, and supporting input variables (to connect to external inputs). Secondly, we introduce and describe CIF's benchmark models, a collection of 23 freely available industrial and academic models of various sizes and complexities. Thirdly, we describe recent improvements between ESCET versions v0.8 (December 2022) and v4.0 (June 2024) that affect synthesis performance, evaluate them on our benchmark models, and show the current practical synthesis performance of CIF. Fourthly, we briefly look at multi-level synthesis, a non-monolithic synthesis approach, evaluate its gains, and show that while it can help to further improve synthesis performance, further performance improvements are still needed to synthesize complex models.</p></details> |  |

As a result, cloud-native techniques, such as microservices and container orchestration, play an increasingly important role in their operation. However, orchestrating applications in a large-scale C-ITS poses unique challenges due to the dynamic nature of the environment and the need for efficient resource utilization. In this paper, we present a demand-driven application management approach that leverages cloud-native techniques - specifically Kubernetes - to address these challenges. Taking into account the demands originating from different entities within the C-ITS, the approach enables the automation of processes, such as deployment, reconfiguration, update, upgrade, and scaling of microservices. Executing these processes on demand can, for example, reduce computing resource consumption and network traffic. A demand may include a request for provisioning an external supporting service, such as a collective environment model. The approach handles changing and new demands by dynamically reconciling them through our proposed application management framework built on Kubernetes and the Robot Operating System (ROS 2). We demonstrate the operation of our framework in the C-ITS use case of collective environment perception and make the source code of the prototypical framework publicly available at https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/application_manager.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025), Gold Coast, Australia, November 18-21, 2025</p></details> |
| **[PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A Tool for Benchmarking Large Language Models' Robustness in Assessing the Realism of Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04267v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, autonomous driving systems have made significant progress, yet ensuring their safety remains a key challenge. To this end, scenario-based testing offers a practical solution, and simulation-based methods have gained traction due to the high cost and risk of real-world testing. However, evaluating the realism of simulated scenarios remains difficult, creating demand for effective assessment methods. Recent advances show that Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, suggesting their potential in assessing scenario realism through scenario-related textual prompts. Motivated by this, we propose DriveRLR, a benchmark tool to assess the robustness of LLMs in evaluating the realism of driving scenarios. DriveRLR generates mutated scenario variants, constructs prompts, which are then used to assess a given LLM's ability and robustness in determining the realism of driving scenarios. We validate DriveRLR on the DeepScenario dataset using three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-5, Llama 4 Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2. Results show that DriveRLR effectively reveals differences in the robustness of various LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical value in scenario realism assessment. Beyond LLM robustness evaluation, DriveRLR can serve as a practical component in applications such as an objective function to guide scenario generation, supporting simulation-based ADS testing workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test smells in LLM-Generated Unit Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10628v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs promise to transform unit test generation from a manual burden into an automated solution. Yet, beyond metrics such as compilability or coverage, little is known about the quality of LLM-generated tests, particularly their susceptibility to test smells, design flaws that undermine readability and maintainability. This paper presents the first multi-benchmark, large-scale analysis of test smell diffusion in LLM-generated unit tests. We contrast LLM outputs with human-written suites (as the reference for real-world practices) and SBST-generated tests from EvoSuite (as the automated baseline), disentangling whether LLMs reproduce human-like flaws or artifacts of synthetic generation. Our study draws on 20,505 class-level suites from four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B), 972 method-level cases from TestBench, 14,469 EvoSuite tests, and 779,585 human-written tests from 34,635 open-source Java projects. Using two complementary detection tools (TsDetect and JNose), we analyze prevalence, co-occurrence, and correlations with software attributes and generation parameters. Results show that LLM-generated tests consistently manifest smells such as Assertion Roulette and Magic Number Test, with patterns strongly influenced by prompting strategy, context length, and model scale. Comparisons reveal overlaps with human-written tests, raising concerns of potential data leakage from training corpora while EvoSuite exhibits distinct, generator-specific flaws. These findings highlight both the promise and the risks of LLM-based test generation, and call for the design of smell-aware generation frameworks, prompt engineering strategies, and enhanced detection tools to ensure maintainable, high-quality test code.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically, we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise. Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Automated code review generation offers a promising solution to this challenge. Both deep learning-based generative techniques and retrieval-based methods have demonstrated strong performance in this task. However, despite these advancements, there are still some limitations where generated reviews can be either off-point or overly general. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reviewer (RARe), which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine retrieval-based and generative methods, explicitly incorporating external domain knowledge into the code review process. RARe uses a dense retriever to select the most relevant reviews from the codebase, which then enrich the input for a neural generator, utilizing the contextual learning capacity of large language models (LLMs), to produce the final review. RARe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 12.32 and 12.96, respectively. Its effectiveness is further validated through a detailed human evaluation and a case study using an interpretability tool, demonstrating its practical utility and reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, their lack of expertise in operating the generated code remains a key barrier to realizing customized applications. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer a high level of abstraction for code execution and deployment, allowing users to run LLM-generated code without requiring technical expertise or incurring operational overhead. In this paper, we present LLM4FaaS, a no-code application development approach that integrates LLMs and FaaS platforms to enable non-technical users to build and run customized applications using only natural language. By deploying LLM-generated code through FaaS, LLM4FaaS abstracts away infrastructure management and boilerplate code generation. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype based on an open-source FaaS platform, and evaluate it using real prompts from non-technical users. Experiments with GPT-4o show that LLM4FaaS can automatically build and deploy code in 71.47% of cases, outperforming a non-FaaS baseline at 43.48% and an existing LLM-based platform at 14.55%, narrowing the gap to human performance at 88.99%. Further analysis of code quality, programming language diversity, latency, and consistency demonstrates a balanced performance in terms of efficiency, maintainability and availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing</p></details> |
| **[Generating Software Architecture Description from Source Code using Reverse Engineering and Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05165v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Is Self-admitted Code Generated by Large Language Models on GitHub?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19544v4)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has garnered significant attention from researchers evaluating the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for code generation. However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which do not adequately capture the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To address this gap, our study investigates self-admitted code generated by LLMs on GitHub, specifically focusing on instances where developers in projects with over five stars acknowledge the use of LLMs to generate code through code comments. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot dominate code generation, with minimal contributions from other LLMs. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code appears in small/medium-sized projects led by small teams, which are continuously evolving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally is a minor project portion, primarily generating short/moderate-length, low-complexity snippets (e.g., algorithms and data structures code; text processing code). (4) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally undergoes minimal modifications, with bug-related changes ranging from 4% to 12%. (5) Most code comments only state LLM use, while few include details like prompts, human edits, or code testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[UA-Code-Bench: A Competitive Programming Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Code Generation in Ukrainian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05040v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models.

| **[Black-box Context-free Grammar Inference for Readable & Natural Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26616v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis, reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada, and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large, complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Software Defined Vehicle Code Generation: A Few-Shot Prompting Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04849v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) marks a paradigm shift in the automotive industry, where software now plays a pivotal role in defining vehicle functionality, enabling rapid innovation of modern vehicles. Developing SDV-specific applications demands advanced tools to streamline code generation and improve development efficiency. In recent years, general-purpose large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across domains. Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match the expected outcomes based on quantitative metrics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Testora: Using Natural Language Intent to Detect Behavioral Regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18597v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software is evolving, code changes can introduce regression bugs or affect the behavior in other unintended ways. Traditional regression test generation is impractical for detecting unintended behavioral changes, because it reports all behavioral differences as potential regressions. However, most code changes are intended to change the behavior in some way, e.g., to fix a bug or to add a new feature. This paper presents Testora, the first automated approach that detects regressions by comparing the intentions of a code change against behavioral differences caused by the code change. Given a pull request (PR), Testora queries an LLM to generate tests that exercise the modified code, compares the behavior of the original and modified code, and classifies any behavioral differences as intended or unintended. For the classification, we present an LLM-based technique that leverages the natural language information associated with the PR, such as the title, description, and commit messages -- effectively using the natural language intent to detect behavioral regressions. Applying Testora to PRs of complex and popular Python projects, we find 19 regression bugs and 11 PRs that, despite having another intention, coincidentally fix a bug. Out of 13 regressions reported to the developers, 11 have been confirmed and 9 have already been fixed. The costs of using Testora are acceptable for real-world deployment, with 12.3 minutes to check a PR and LLM costs of only $0.003 per PR. We envision our approach to be used before or shortly after a code change gets merged into a code base, providing a way to early on detect regressions that are not caught by traditional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2026</p></details> |

However, few benchmarks directly evaluate this capability and current datasets often rely on artificial sources. We introduce EDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM code editing capabilities grounded in real-world usage, i.e., user instructions and code contexts collected in the wild. EDIT-Bench comprises of 545 problems, multiple natural and programming languages, and a diverse set of real-world use cases, ranging from resolving errors to adding features. EDIT-Bench introduces context-dependent problems that require the model to understand code context, highlighted code, and cursor position in addition to the user instruction. We evaluate 40 diverse LLMs and observe that EDIT-Bench is a challenging set of problems where only 5 models score over 60%. We find that model performance varies across different categories of user instructions. Further, we find that varying levels of contextual information greatly affect task success rate, with performance varying up to 11%, indicating the importance of evaluating with realistic context.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a reproducible demonstration system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI and LLM tools. Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138 repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects: repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48 hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Through machine learning models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify key predictors of viral growth. Posting timing appears as key factor--launching at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the "Show HN" tag shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. The demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware, automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations through single-file scripts. This makes our findings immediately reproducible and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures.

The Impact of LLM Agent Assistance on Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in their application to software development, with practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent assistant designers, and researchers.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |

In this paper, we present LLM4FaaS, a no-code application development approach that integrates LLMs and FaaS platforms to enable non-technical users to build and run customized applications using only natural language. By deploying LLM-generated code through FaaS, LLM4FaaS abstracts away infrastructure management and boilerplate code generation. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype based on an open-source FaaS platform, and evaluate it using real prompts from non-technical users. Experiments with GPT-4o show that LLM4FaaS can automatically build and deploy code in 71.47% of cases, outperforming a non-FaaS baseline at 43.48% and an existing LLM-based platform at 14.55%, narrowing the gap to human performance at 88.99%. Further analysis of code quality, programming language diversity, latency, and consistency demonstrates a balanced performance in terms of efficiency, maintainability and availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing</p></details> |
| **[CodeMapper: A Language-Agnostic Approach to Mapping Code Regions Across Commits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05205v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During software evolution, developers commonly face the problem of mapping a specific code region from one commit to another. For example, they may want to determine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a configuration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the code mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this problem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file instead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other techniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g., methods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces CodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is independent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a code region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another commit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by analyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code fragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating similarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two new hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular programming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target region in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available baselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Software Architecture Description from Source Code using Reverse Engineering and Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05165v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks often focus on algorithmic problems or Python-centric bug fixing, leaving critical dimensions of software engineering underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a comprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations into a structured and production-aligned framework. SWE-Compass spans 8 task types, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000 high-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined through systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear hierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover, by aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing agentic coding capabilities in large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically, we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise. Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Review Automation using Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05302v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but is labor-intensive. Automated code review generation offers a promising solution to this challenge. Both deep learning-based generative techniques and retrieval-based methods have demonstrated strong performance in this task. However, despite these advancements, there are still some limitations where generated reviews can be either off-point or overly general. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reviewer (RARe), which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine retrieval-based and generative methods, explicitly incorporating external domain knowledge into the code review process. RARe uses a dense retriever to select the most relevant reviews from the codebase, which then enrich the input for a neural generator, utilizing the contextual learning capacity of large language models (LLMs), to produce the final review. RARe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 12.32 and 12.96, respectively. Its effectiveness is further validated through a detailed human evaluation and a case study using an interpretability tool, demonstrating its practical utility and reliability.</p></details> |  |

Companies like LemonLearning have shown how digital guidance can reduce training costs and accelerate onboarding. However, building and maintaining these interactive guides still requires extensive manual effort. Leveraging Large Language Models as virtual assistants is an appealing alternative, yet without a structured understanding of the target software, LLMs often hallucinate and produce unreliable answers. Moreover, most production-grade LLMs are black-box APIs, making fine-tuning impractical due to the lack of access to model weights. In this work, we introduce a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that automatically converts enterprise web applications into state-action knowledge graphs, enabling LLMs to generate grounded and context-aware assistance. The framework was co-developed with the AI enterprise RAKAM, in collaboration with Lemon Learning. We detail the engineering pipeline that extracts and structures software interfaces, the design of the graph-based retrieval process, and the integration of our approach into production DAP workflows. Finally, we discuss scalability, robustness, and deployment lessons learned from industrial use cases.</p></details> |  |

| **[Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dependencies between modules can trigger ripple effects when changes are made, making maintenance complex and costly, so minimizing these dependencies is crucial. Consequently, understanding what drives dependencies is important. One potential factor is code smells, which are symptoms in code that indicate design issues and reduce code quality. When multiple code smells interact through static dependencies, their combined impact on quality can be even more severe. While individual code smells have been widely studied, the influence of their interactions remains underexplored. In this study, we aim to investigate whether and how the distribution of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify these interactions by comparing cases where code smell interactions exist and where they do not. Our results suggest that overall, code smell interactions are linked to a significant increase in total dependencies in 28 out of 36 cases, and that all code smells are associated with a consistent change direction (increase or decrease) in certain dependency types when interacting with other code smells. Consequently, this information can be used to support more accurate code smell detection and prioritization, as well as to develop more effective refactoring strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chasing One-day Vulnerabilities Across Open Source Forks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05097v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking vulnerabilities inherited from third-party open-source components is a well-known challenge, often addressed by tracing the threads of dependency information. However, vulnerabilities can also propagate through forking: a repository forked after the introduction of a vulnerability, but before it is patched, may remain vulnerable in the fork well after being fixed in the original project. Current approaches for vulnerability analysis lack the commit-level granularity needed to track vulnerability introductions and fixes across forks, potentially leaving one-day vulnerabilities undetected. This paper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day vulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public code, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates vulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact analysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not incorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162 repositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their development histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one vulnerable commit. Then we perform a strict filtering, allowing us to find 356 ___vulnerability, fork___ pairs impacting active and popular GitHub forks, we manually evaluate 65 pairs, finding 3 high-severity vulnerabilities, demonstrating the impact and applicability of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Is Self-admitted Code Generated by Large Language Models on GitHub?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19544v4)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has garnered significant attention from researchers evaluating the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for code generation. However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which do not adequately capture the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To address this gap, our study investigates self-admitted code generated by LLMs on GitHub, specifically focusing on instances where developers in projects with over five stars acknowledge the use of LLMs to generate code through code comments. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot dominate code generation, with minimal contributions from other LLMs. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code appears in small/medium-sized projects led by small teams, which are continuously evolving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally is a minor project portion, primarily generating short/moderate-length, low-complexity snippets (e.g., algorithms and data structures code; text processing code). (4) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally undergoes minimal modifications, with bug-related changes ranging from 4% to 12%. (5) Most code comments only state LLM use, while few include details like prompts, human edits, or code testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code generation, and evaluation scripts are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NLPForUA/ua-code-bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

A Study on the Responsiveness of NPM Package Maintainers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04986v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Widespread use of third-party libraries makes ecosystems like Node Package Manager (npm) critical to modern software development. However, this interconnected chain of dependencies also creates challenges: bugs in one library can propagate downstream, potentially impacting many other libraries that rely on it. We hypothesize that maintainers may not always decide to fix a bug, especially if the maintainer decides it falls out of their responsibility within the chain of dependencies. Aims: To confirm this hypothesis, we investigate the responsiveness of 30,340 bug reports across 500 of the most depended-upon npm packages. Method: We adopt a mixed-method approach to mine repository issue data and perform qualitative open coding to analyze reasons behind unaddressed bug reports. Results: Our findings show that maintainers are generally responsive, with a median project-level responsiveness of 70% (IQR: 55%-89%), reflecting their commitment to support downstream developers. Conclusions: We present a taxonomy of the reasons some bugs remain unresolved. The taxonomy includes contribution practices, dependency constraints, and library-specific standards as reasons for not being responsive. Understanding maintainer behavior can inform practices that promote a more robust and responsive open-source ecosystem that benefits the entire community.</p></details> |  |

We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |

While its use in coding tasks shows considerable promise, applying GenAI across the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has not yet been fully explored. Critical uncertainties in areas such as reliability, accountability, security, and data privacy demand deeper investigation and coordinated action. The GENIUS project, comprising over 30 European industrial and academic partners, aims to address these challenges by advancing AI integration across all SDLC phases. It focuses on GenAI's potential, the development of innovative tools, and emerging research challenges, actively shaping the future of software engineering. This vision paper presents a shared perspective on the future of GenAI-driven software engineering, grounded in cross-sector dialogue as well as experiences and findings within the GENIUS consortium. The paper explores four central elements: (1) a structured overview of current challenges in GenAI adoption across the SDLC; (2) a forward-looking vision outlining key technological and methodological advances expected over the next five years; (3) anticipated shifts in the roles and required skill sets of software professionals; and (4) the contribution of GENIUS in realising this transformation through practical tools and industrial validation.

Developing SDV-specific applications demands advanced tools to streamline code generation and improve development efficiency. In recent years, general-purpose large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across domains. Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match the expected outcomes based on quantitative metrics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

We present Pixi, a unified package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers. Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours to minutes and lowers technical barriers for researchers worldwide.

These AI-powered systems function as autonomous teammates capable of planning and executing complex development tasks. Agents have become active participants in refactoring, a cornerstone of sustainable software development aimed at improving internal code quality without altering observable behavior. Despite their increasing adoption, there is a critical lack of empirical understanding regarding how agentic refactoring is utilized in practice, how it compares to human-driven refactoring, and what impact it has on code quality. To address this empirical gap, we present a large-scale study of AI agent-generated refactorings in real-world open-source Java projects, analyzing 15,451 refactoring instances across 12,256 pull requests and 14,988 commits derived from the AIDev dataset. Our empirical analysis shows that refactoring is a common and intentional activity in this development paradigm, with agents explicitly targeting refactoring in 26.1% of commits. Analysis of refactoring types reveals that agentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as Change Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable (8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level design changes common in human refactoring. Additionally, the motivations behind agentic refactoring focus overwhelmingly on internal quality concerns, with maintainability (52.5%) and readability (28.1%). Furthermore, quantitative evaluation of code quality metrics shows that agentic refactoring yields small but statistically significant improvements in structural metrics, particularly for medium-level changes, reducing class size and complexity (e.g., Class LOC median $\Delta$ = -15.25).</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 Tables, 5 Figuress, Submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology(TOSEM)</p></details> |

Mapping methods are widely used across disciplines to visualize relationships among objects as spatial representations, or maps. However, most existing statistical software supports only static mapping, which captures objects' relationships at a single point in time and lacks tools to analyze how these relationships evolve. evomap fills this gap by implementing the dynamic mapping framework EvoMap, originally proposed by Matthe, Ringel, and Skiera (2023), which adapts traditional static mapping methods for dynamic analyses. The package supports multiple mapping techniques, including variants of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Sammon Mapping, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). It also includes utilities for data preprocessing, exploration, and result evaluation, offering a comprehensive toolkit for dynamic mapping applications. This paper outlines the foundations of static and dynamic mapping, describes the architecture and functionality of evomap, and illustrates its application through an extensive usage example.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by the Journal of Statistical Software</p></details> |

To trace the root cause of the inter-module coupling, this paper, starting from the impact assessment approach for module changes, proposes a conceptual method for calculating module independence and utilizes this method to derive the necessary conditions for module independence. Then, a new system design philosophy and software engineering methodology is proposed, aimed at eliminating dependencies between modules. A specific pattern is employed to design a set of universal interfaces, serving as a universal boundary between modules. Subsequently, this method is used to implement a platform architecture named EIGHT, demonstrating that, as long as module independence is guaranteed, even a monolithic application within a single process can dynamically load, unload, or modify any part at runtime. Finally, the paper concludes that this architecture aims to explore a novel path for increasingly complex systems, beyond microservice and monolithic architectures.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Testora: Using Natural Language Intent to Detect Behavioral Regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18597v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software is evolving, code changes can introduce regression bugs or affect the behavior in other unintended ways. Traditional regression test generation is impractical for detecting unintended behavioral changes, because it reports all behavioral differences as potential regressions. However, most code changes are intended to change the behavior in some way, e.g., to fix a bug or to add a new feature. This paper presents Testora, the first automated approach that detects regressions by comparing the intentions of a code change against behavioral differences caused by the code change. Given a pull request (PR), Testora queries an LLM to generate tests that exercise the modified code, compares the behavior of the original and modified code, and classifies any behavioral differences as intended or unintended. For the classification, we present an LLM-based technique that leverages the natural language information associated with the PR, such as the title, description, and commit messages -- effectively using the natural language intent to detect behavioral regressions. Applying Testora to PRs of complex and popular Python projects, we find 19 regression bugs and 11 PRs that, despite having another intention, coincidentally fix a bug. Out of 13 regressions reported to the developers, 11 have been confirmed and 9 have already been fixed. The costs of using Testora are acceptable for real-world deployment, with 12.3 minutes to check a PR and LLM costs of only $0.003 per PR. We envision our approach to be used before or shortly after a code change gets merged into a code base, providing a way to early on detect regressions that are not caught by traditional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2026</p></details> |

However, few benchmarks directly evaluate this capability and current datasets often rely on artificial sources. We introduce EDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM code editing capabilities grounded in real-world usage, i.e., user instructions and code contexts collected in the wild. EDIT-Bench comprises of 545 problems, multiple natural and programming languages, and a diverse set of real-world use cases, ranging from resolving errors to adding features. EDIT-Bench introduces context-dependent problems that require the model to understand code context, highlighted code, and cursor position in addition to the user instruction. We evaluate 40 diverse LLMs and observe that EDIT-Bench is a challenging set of problems where only 5 models score over 60%. We find that model performance varies across different categories of user instructions. Further, we find that varying levels of contextual information greatly affect task success rate, with performance varying up to 11%, indicating the importance of evaluating with realistic context.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a reproducible demonstration system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI and LLM tools. Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138 repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects: repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48 hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Through machine learning models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify key predictors of viral growth. Posting timing appears as key factor--launching at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the "Show HN" tag shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. The demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware, automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations through single-file scripts. This makes our findings immediately reproducible and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures.

The Impact of LLM Agent Assistance on Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in their application to software development, with practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent assistant designers, and researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overview and Performance Evaluation of Supervisory Controller Synthesis with Eclipse ESCET v4.0](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04370v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervisory controllers control cyber-physical systems to ensure their correct and safe operation. Synthesis-based engineering (SBE) is an approach to largely automate their design and implementation. SBE combines model-based engineering with computer-aided design, allowing engineers to focus on 'what' the system should do (the requirements) rather than 'how' it should do it (design and implementation). In the Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (ESCET) open-source project, a community of users, researchers, and tool vendors jointly develop a toolkit to support the entire SBE process, particularly through the CIF modeling language and tools. In this paper, we first provide a description of CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis algorithm, and thereby include aspects that are often omitted in the literature, but are of great practical relevance, such as the prevention of runtime errors, handling different types of requirements, and supporting input variables (to connect to external inputs). Secondly, we introduce and describe CIF's benchmark models, a collection of 23 freely available industrial and academic models of various sizes and complexities. Thirdly, we describe recent improvements between ESCET versions v0.8 (December 2022) and v4.0 (June 2024) that affect synthesis performance, evaluate them on our benchmark models, and show the current practical synthesis performance of CIF. Fourthly, we briefly look at multi-level synthesis, a non-monolithic synthesis approach, evaluate its gains, and show that while it can help to further improve synthesis performance, further performance improvements are still needed to synthesize complex models.</p></details> |  |

An In-Depth Analysis of Code Generation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04355v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code generation, and the race to improve their performance has become a central focus of AI research. Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular, offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our analysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track</p></details> |

As a result, cloud-native techniques, such as microservices and container orchestration, play an increasingly important role in their operation. However, orchestrating applications in a large-scale C-ITS poses unique challenges due to the dynamic nature of the environment and the need for efficient resource utilization. In this paper, we present a demand-driven application management approach that leverages cloud-native techniques - specifically Kubernetes - to address these challenges. Taking into account the demands originating from different entities within the C-ITS, the approach enables the automation of processes, such as deployment, reconfiguration, update, upgrade, and scaling of microservices. Executing these processes on demand can, for example, reduce computing resource consumption and network traffic. A demand may include a request for provisioning an external supporting service, such as a collective environment model. The approach handles changing and new demands by dynamically reconciling them through our proposed application management framework built on Kubernetes and the Robot Operating System (ROS 2). We demonstrate the operation of our framework in the C-ITS use case of collective environment perception and make the source code of the prototypical framework publicly available at https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/application_manager.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025), Gold Coast, Australia, November 18-21, 2025</p></details> |
| **[PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</p></details> | Under review |

This fragmentation makes reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible research in LLM safety.</p></details> |  |

The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the software development process away from traditional areas such as design or technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pragmatic Reasoning improves LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15835v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in translating natural language (NL) instructions into program code. However, user instructions often contain inherent ambiguities, making it challenging for LLMs to generate code that accurately reflects the user's true intent. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed approaches that produce multiple candidates of the program code and then rerank them to identify the best solution. In this paper, we propose CodeRSA, a novel code candidate reranking mechanism built upon the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, designed to guide LLMs toward more comprehensive pragmatic reasoning about user intent. We evaluate CodeRSA using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct on two widely used code generation benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP. Our experiment results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into code candidate reranking, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tool for Benchmarking Large Language Models' Robustness in Assessing the Realism of Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04267v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, autonomous driving systems have made significant progress, yet ensuring their safety remains a key challenge. To this end, scenario-based testing offers a practical solution, and simulation-based methods have gained traction due to the high cost and risk of real-world testing. However, evaluating the realism of simulated scenarios remains difficult, creating demand for effective assessment methods. Recent advances show that Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, suggesting their potential in assessing scenario realism through scenario-related textual prompts. Motivated by this, we propose DriveRLR, a benchmark tool to assess the robustness of LLMs in evaluating the realism of driving scenarios. DriveRLR generates mutated scenario variants, constructs prompts, which are then used to assess a given LLM's ability and robustness in determining the realism of driving scenarios. We validate DriveRLR on the DeepScenario dataset using three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-5, Llama 4 Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2. Results show that DriveRLR effectively reveals differences in the robustness of various LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical value in scenario realism assessment. Beyond LLM robustness evaluation, DriveRLR can serve as a practical component in applications such as an objective function to guide scenario generation, supporting simulation-based ADS testing workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test smells in LLM-Generated Unit Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10628v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs promise to transform unit test generation from a manual burden into an automated solution. Yet, beyond metrics such as compilability or coverage, little is known about the quality of LLM-generated tests, particularly their susceptibility to test smells, design flaws that undermine readability and maintainability. This paper presents the first multi-benchmark, large-scale analysis of test smell diffusion in LLM-generated unit tests. We contrast LLM outputs with human-written suites (as the reference for real-world practices) and SBST-generated tests from EvoSuite (as the automated baseline), disentangling whether LLMs reproduce human-like flaws or artifacts of synthetic generation. Our study draws on 20,505 class-level suites from four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B), 972 method-level cases from TestBench, 14,469 EvoSuite tests, and 779,585 human-written tests from 34,635 open-source Java projects. Using two complementary detection tools (TsDetect and JNose), we analyze prevalence, co-occurrence, and correlations with software attributes and generation parameters. Results show that LLM-generated tests consistently manifest smells such as Assertion Roulette and Magic Number Test, with patterns strongly influenced by prompting strategy, context length, and model scale. Comparisons reveal overlaps with human-written tests, raising concerns of potential data leakage from training corpora while EvoSuite exhibits distinct, generator-specific flaws. These findings highlight both the promise and the risks of LLM-based test generation, and call for the design of smell-aware generation frameworks, prompt engineering strategies, and enhanced detection tools to ensure maintainable, high-quality test code.</p></details> |  |

Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing.

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks often focus on algorithmic problems or Python-centric bug fixing, leaving critical dimensions of software engineering underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a comprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations into a structured and production-aligned framework. SWE-Compass spans 8 task types, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000 high-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined through systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear hierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover, by aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing agentic coding capabilities in large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |
| **[Code Review Automation using Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05302v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but is labor-intensive. Automated code review generation offers a promising solution to this challenge. Both deep learning-based generative techniques and retrieval-based methods have demonstrated strong performance in this task. However, despite these advancements, there are still some limitations where generated reviews can be either off-point or overly general. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reviewer (RARe), which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine retrieval-based and generative methods, explicitly incorporating external domain knowledge into the code review process. RARe uses a dense retriever to select the most relevant reviews from the codebase, which then enrich the input for a neural generator, utilizing the contextual learning capacity of large language models (LLMs), to produce the final review. RARe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 12.32 and 12.96, respectively. Its effectiveness is further validated through a detailed human evaluation and a case study using an interpretability tool, demonstrating its practical utility and reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, their lack of expertise in operating the generated code remains a key barrier to realizing customized applications. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer a high level of abstraction for code execution and deployment, allowing users to run LLM-generated code without requiring technical expertise or incurring operational overhead. In this paper, we present LLM4FaaS, a no-code application development approach that integrates LLMs and FaaS platforms to enable non-technical users to build and run customized applications using only natural language. By deploying LLM-generated code through FaaS, LLM4FaaS abstracts away infrastructure management and boilerplate code generation. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype based on an open-source FaaS platform, and evaluate it using real prompts from non-technical users. Experiments with GPT-4o show that LLM4FaaS can automatically build and deploy code in 71.47% of cases, outperforming a non-FaaS baseline at 43.48% and an existing LLM-based platform at 14.55%, narrowing the gap to human performance at 88.99%. Further analysis of code quality, programming language diversity, latency, and consistency demonstrates a balanced performance in terms of efficiency, maintainability and availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing</p></details> |
| **[CodeMapper: A Language-Agnostic Approach to Mapping Code Regions Across Commits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05205v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During software evolution, developers commonly face the problem of mapping a specific code region from one commit to another. For example, they may want to determine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a configuration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the code mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this problem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file instead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other techniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g., methods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces CodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is independent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a code region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another commit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by analyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code fragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating similarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two new hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular programming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target region in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available baselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Software Architecture Description from Source Code using Reverse Engineering and Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05165v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dependencies between modules can trigger ripple effects when changes are made, making maintenance complex and costly, so minimizing these dependencies is crucial. Consequently, understanding what drives dependencies is important. One potential factor is code smells, which are symptoms in code that indicate design issues and reduce code quality. When multiple code smells interact through static dependencies, their combined impact on quality can be even more severe. While individual code smells have been widely studied, the influence of their interactions remains underexplored. In this study, we aim to investigate whether and how the distribution of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify these interactions by comparing cases where code smell interactions exist and where they do not. Our results suggest that overall, code smell interactions are linked to a significant increase in total dependencies in 28 out of 36 cases, and that all code smells are associated with a consistent change direction (increase or decrease) in certain dependency types when interacting with other code smells. Consequently, this information can be used to support more accurate code smell detection and prioritization, as well as to develop more effective refactoring strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chasing One-day Vulnerabilities Across Open Source Forks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05097v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking vulnerabilities inherited from third-party open-source components is a well-known challenge, often addressed by tracing the threads of dependency information. However, vulnerabilities can also propagate through forking: a repository forked after the introduction of a vulnerability, but before it is patched, may remain vulnerable in the fork well after being fixed in the original project. Current approaches for vulnerability analysis lack the commit-level granularity needed to track vulnerability introductions and fixes across forks, potentially leaving one-day vulnerabilities undetected. This paper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day vulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public code, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates vulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact analysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not incorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162 repositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their development histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one vulnerable commit. Then we perform a strict filtering, allowing us to find 356 ___vulnerability, fork___ pairs impacting active and popular GitHub forks, we manually evaluate 65 pairs, finding 3 high-severity vulnerabilities, demonstrating the impact and applicability of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Is Self-admitted Code Generated by Large Language Models on GitHub?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19544v4)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has garnered significant attention from researchers evaluating the capabilities and limitations of LLMs for code generation. However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which do not adequately capture the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To address this gap, our study investigates self-admitted code generated by LLMs on GitHub, specifically focusing on instances where developers in projects with over five stars acknowledge the use of LLMs to generate code through code comments. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot dominate code generation, with minimal contributions from other LLMs. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code appears in small/medium-sized projects led by small teams, which are continuously evolving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally is a minor project portion, primarily generating short/moderate-length, low-complexity snippets (e.g., algorithms and data structures code; text processing code). (4) ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code generally undergoes minimal modifications, with bug-related changes ranging from 4% to 12%. (5) Most code comments only state LLM use, while few include details like prompts, human edits, or code testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[UA-Code-Bench: A Competitive Programming Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Code Generation in Ukrainian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05040v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code generation, and evaluation scripts are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NLPForUA/ua-code-bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[What About Our Bug? A Study on the Responsiveness of NPM Package Maintainers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04986v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Widespread use of third-party libraries makes ecosystems like Node Package Manager (npm) critical to modern software development. However, this interconnected chain of dependencies also creates challenges: bugs in one library can propagate downstream, potentially impacting many other libraries that rely on it. We hypothesize that maintainers may not always decide to fix a bug, especially if the maintainer decides it falls out of their responsibility within the chain of dependencies. Aims: To confirm this hypothesis, we investigate the responsiveness of 30,340 bug reports across 500 of the most depended-upon npm packages. Method: We adopt a mixed-method approach to mine repository issue data and perform qualitative open coding to analyze reasons behind unaddressed bug reports. Results: Our findings show that maintainers are generally responsive, with a median project-level responsiveness of 70% (IQR: 55%-89%), reflecting their commitment to support downstream developers. Conclusions: We present a taxonomy of the reasons some bugs remain unresolved. The taxonomy includes contribution practices, dependency constraints, and library-specific standards as reasons for not being responsive. Understanding maintainer behavior can inform practices that promote a more robust and responsive open-source ecosystem that benefits the entire community.</p></details> |  |

While its use in coding tasks shows considerable promise, applying GenAI across the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has not yet been fully explored. Critical uncertainties in areas such as reliability, accountability, security, and data privacy demand deeper investigation and coordinated action. The GENIUS project, comprising over 30 European industrial and academic partners, aims to address these challenges by advancing AI integration across all SDLC phases. It focuses on GenAI's potential, the development of innovative tools, and emerging research challenges, actively shaping the future of software engineering. This vision paper presents a shared perspective on the future of GenAI-driven software engineering, grounded in cross-sector dialogue as well as experiences and findings within the GENIUS consortium. The paper explores four central elements: (1) a structured overview of current challenges in GenAI adoption across the SDLC; (2) a forward-looking vision outlining key technological and methodological advances expected over the next five years; (3) anticipated shifts in the roles and required skill sets of software professionals; and (4) the contribution of GENIUS in realising this transformation through practical tools and industrial validation. This paper focuses on aligning technical innovation with business relevance. It aims to inform both research agendas and industrial strategies, providing a foundation for reliable, scalable, and industry-ready GenAI solutions for software engineering teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware 2025)</p></details> |

Developing SDV-specific applications demands advanced tools to streamline code generation and improve development efficiency. In recent years, general-purpose large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across domains. Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match the expected outcomes based on quantitative metrics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Existing studies reveal that up to 70% of robotics algorithms cannot be reproduced by independent teams, while many others fail to reach deployment because creating shareable software environments remains prohibitively complex. These challenges stem from fragmented, multi-language, and hardware-software toolchains that lead to dependency hell. We present Pixi, a unified package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers. Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours to minutes and lowers technical barriers for researchers worldwide. By enabling scalable, reproducible, collaborative research infrastructure, Pixi accelerates progress in robotics and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 3 figures, 11 code snippets</p></details> |

These AI-powered systems function as autonomous teammates capable of planning and executing complex development tasks. Agents have become active participants in refactoring, a cornerstone of sustainable software development aimed at improving internal code quality without altering observable behavior. Despite their increasing adoption, there is a critical lack of empirical understanding regarding how agentic refactoring is utilized in practice, how it compares to human-driven refactoring, and what impact it has on code quality. To address this empirical gap, we present a large-scale study of AI agent-generated refactorings in real-world open-source Java projects, analyzing 15,451 refactoring instances across 12,256 pull requests and 14,988 commits derived from the AIDev dataset. Our empirical analysis shows that refactoring is a common and intentional activity in this development paradigm, with agents explicitly targeting refactoring in 26.1% of commits. Analysis of refactoring types reveals that agentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as Change Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable (8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level design changes common in human refactoring. Additionally, the motivations behind agentic refactoring focus overwhelmingly on internal quality concerns, with maintainability (52.5%) and readability (28.1%). Furthermore, quantitative evaluation of code quality metrics shows that agentic refactoring yields small but statistically significant improvements in structural metrics, particularly for medium-level changes, reducing class size and complexity (e.g., Class LOC median $\Delta$ = -15.25).</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 Tables, 5 Figuress, Submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology(TOSEM)</p></details> |

Traditional regression test generation is impractical for detecting unintended behavioral changes, because it reports all behavioral differences as potential regressions. However, most code changes are intended to change the behavior in some way, e.g., to fix a bug or to add a new feature. This paper presents Testora, the first automated approach that detects regressions by comparing the intentions of a code change against behavioral differences caused by the code change. Given a pull request (PR), Testora queries an LLM to generate tests that exercise the modified code, compares the behavior of the original and modified code, and classifies any behavioral differences as intended or unintended. For the classification, we present an LLM-based technique that leverages the natural language information associated with the PR, such as the title, description, and commit messages -- effectively using the natural language intent to detect behavioral regressions. Applying Testora to PRs of complex and popular Python projects, we find 19 regression bugs and 11 PRs that, despite having another intention, coincidentally fix a bug. Out of 13 regressions reported to the developers, 11 have been confirmed and 9 have already been fixed. The costs of using Testora are acceptable for real-world deployment, with 12.3 minutes to check a PR and LLM costs of only $0.003 per PR. We envision our approach to be used before or shortly after a code change gets merged into a code base, providing a way to early on detect regressions that are not caught by traditional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2026</p></details> |

However, few benchmarks directly evaluate this capability and current datasets often rely on artificial sources. We introduce EDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM code editing capabilities grounded in real-world usage, i.e., user instructions and code contexts collected in the wild. EDIT-Bench comprises of 545 problems, multiple natural and programming languages, and a diverse set of real-world use cases, ranging from resolving errors to adding features. EDIT-Bench introduces context-dependent problems that require the model to understand code context, highlighted code, and cursor position in addition to the user instruction. We evaluate 40 diverse LLMs and observe that EDIT-Bench is a challenging set of problems where only 5 models score over 60%. We find that model performance varies across different categories of user instructions. Further, we find that varying levels of contextual information greatly affect task success rate, with performance varying up to 11%, indicating the importance of evaluating with realistic context.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a reproducible demonstration system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI and LLM tools. Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138 repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects: repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48 hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Through machine learning models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify key predictors of viral growth. Posting timing appears as key factor--launching at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the "Show HN" tag shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. The demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware, automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations through single-file scripts. This makes our findings immediately reproducible and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures.

The Impact of LLM Agent Assistance on Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in their application to software development, with practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent assistant designers, and researchers.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |

| **[Generating CodeMeta through declarative mapping rules: An open-ended approach using ShExML](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09172v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, software is one of the cornerstones when conducting research in several scientific fields which employ computer-based methodologies to answer new research questions. However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |
