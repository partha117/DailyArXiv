However, these approaches typically rely on the context data from the current snapshot of the project, overlooking the potential of rich historical data residing in real-world software repositories. Additionally, the impact of prompt styles on LLM performance for SE tasks within a historical context remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose HAFix, which stands for History-Augmented LLMs on Bug Fixing, a novel approach that leverages seven individual historical heuristics associated with bugs and aggregates the results of these heuristics (HAFix-Agg) to enhance LLMs' bug-fixing capabilities. To empirically evaluate HAFix, we employ three Code LLMs (i.e., Code Llama, DeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite models) on 51 single-line Python bugs from BugsInPy and 116 single-line Java bugs from Defects4J. Our evaluation demonstrates that multiple HAFix heuristics achieve statistically significant improvements compared to a non-historical baseline inspired by GitHub Copilot. Furthermore, the aggregated HAFix variant HAFix-Agg achieves substantial improvements by combining the complementary strengths of individual heuristics, increasing bug-fixing rates by an average of 45.05% on BugsInPy and 49.92% on Defects4J relative to the corresponding baseline. Moreover, within the context of historical heuristics, we identify the Instruction prompt style as the most effective template compared to the InstructionLabel and InstructionMask for LLMs in bug fixing. Finally, we evaluate the cost of HAFix in terms of inference time and token usage, and provide a pragmatic trade-off analysis of the cost and bug-fixing performance, offering valuable insights for the practical deployment of our approach in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Evalu...</summary><p>Evaluated HAFix on two datasets (BugsInPy, Defects4J) and three LLMs (CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder-V2) and optimized the figures and tables for better readability</p></details> |

AI-driven Matching of Vulnerabilities and Security Unit Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03365v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities are often detected via taint analysis, penetration testing, or fuzzing. They are also found via unit tests that exercise security-sensitive behavior with specific inputs, called vulnerability-witnessing tests. Generative AI models could help developers in writing them, but they require many examples to learn from, which are currently scarce. This paper introduces VuTeCo, an AI-driven framework for collecting examples of vulnerability-witnessing tests from Java repositories. VuTeCo carries out two tasks: (1) The "Finding" task to determine whether a unit test case is security-related, and (2) the "Matching" task to relate a test case to the vulnerability it witnesses. VuTeCo addresses the Finding task with UniXcoder, achieving an F0.5 score of 0.73 and a precision of 0.83 on a test set of unit tests from Vul4J. The Matching task is addressed using DeepSeek Coder, achieving an F0.5 score of 0.65 and a precision of 0.75 on a test set of pairs of unit tests and vulnerabilities from Vul4J. VuTeCo has been used in the wild on 427 Java projects and 1,238 vulnerabilities, obtaining 224 test cases confirmed to be security-related and 35 tests correctly matched to 29 vulnerabilities. The validated tests were collected in a new dataset called Test4Vul. VuTeCo lays the foundation for large-scale retrieval of vulnerability-witnessing tests, enabling future AI models to better understand and generate security unit tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the MSR 2026 Technical Track.

The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and Generative AI (GenAI) engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding redistributes epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting expertise from technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks such as black-box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Our results show that vibe coding redistributes epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting expertise from technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks such as black-box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches typically rely on the context data from the current snapshot of the project, overlooking the potential of rich historical data residing in real-world software repositories. Additionally, the impact of prompt styles on LLM performance for SE tasks within a historical context remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose HAFix, which stands for History-Augmented LLMs on Bug Fixing, a novel approach that leverages seven individual historical heuristics associated with bugs and aggregates the results of these heuristics (HAFix-Agg) to enhance LLMs' bug-fixing capabilities. To empirically evaluate HAFix, we employ three Code LLMs (i.e., Code Llama, DeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite models) on 51 single-line Python bugs from BugsInPy and 116 single-line Java bugs from Defects4J. Our evaluation demonstrates that multiple HAFix heuristics achieve statistically significant improvements compared to a non-historical baseline inspired by GitHub Copilot. Furthermore, the aggregated HAFix variant HAFix-Agg achieves substantial improvements by combining the complementary strengths of individual heuristics, increasing bug-fixing rates by an average of 45.05% on BugsInPy and 49.92% on Defects4J relative to the corresponding baseline. Moreover, within the context of historical heuristics, we identify the Instruction prompt style as the most effective template compared to the InstructionLabel and InstructionMask for LLMs in bug fixing.

| **[HAFix: History-Augmented Large Language Models for Bug Fixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09135v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have explored the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various Software Engineering (SE) tasks, such as code generation and bug fixing. However, these approaches typically rely on the context data from the current snapshot of the project, overlooking the potential of rich historical data residing in real-world software repositories. Additionally, the impact of prompt styles on LLM performance for SE tasks within a historical context remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose HAFix, which stands for History-Augmented LLMs on Bug Fixing, a novel approach that leverages seven individual historical heuristics associated with bugs and aggregates the results of these heuristics (HAFix-Agg) to enhance LLMs' bug-fixing capabilities. To empirically evaluate HAFix, we employ three Code LLMs (i.e., Code Llama, DeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite models) on 51 single-line Python bugs from BugsInPy and 116 single-line Java bugs from Defects4J. Our evaluation demonstrates that multiple HAFix heuristics achieve statistically significant improvements compared to a non-historical baseline inspired by GitHub Copilot. Furthermore, the aggregated HAFix variant HAFix-Agg achieves substantial improvements by combining the complementary strengths of individual heuristics, increasing bug-fixing rates by an average of 45.05% on BugsInPy and 49.92% on Defects4J relative to the corresponding baseline. Moreover, within the context of historical heuristics, we identify the Instruction prompt style as the most effective template compared to the InstructionLabel and InstructionMask for LLMs in bug fixing. Finally, we evaluate the cost of HAFix in terms of inference time and token usage, and provide a pragmatic trade-off analysis of the cost and bug-fixing performance, offering valuable insights for the practical deployment of our approach in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Evalu...</summary><p>Evaluated HAFix on two datasets (BugsInPy, Defects4J) and three LLMs (CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder-V2) and optimized the figures and tables for better readability</p></details> |
| **[A Match Made in Heaven? AI-driven Matching of Vulnerabilities and Security Unit Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03365v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities are often detected via taint analysis, penetration testing, or fuzzing. They are also found via unit tests that exercise security-sensitive behavior with specific inputs, called vulnerability-witnessing tests. Generative AI models could help developers in writing them, but they require many examples to learn from, which are currently scarce. This paper introduces VuTeCo, an AI-driven framework for collecting examples of vulnerability-witnessing tests from Java repositories. VuTeCo carries out two tasks: (1) The "Finding" task to determine whether a unit test case is security-related, and (2) the "Matching" task to relate a test case to the vulnerability it witnesses. VuTeCo addresses the Finding task with UniXcoder, achieving an F0.5 score of 0.73 and a precision of 0.83 on a test set of unit tests from Vul4J. The Matching task is addressed using DeepSeek Coder, achieving an F0.5 score of 0.65 and a precision of 0.75 on a test set of pairs of unit tests and vulnerabilities from Vul4J. VuTeCo has been used in the wild on 427 Java projects and 1,238 vulnerabilities, obtaining 224 test cases confirmed to be security-related and 35 tests correctly matched to 29 vulnerabilities. The validated tests were collected in a new dataset called Test4Vul. VuTeCo lays the foundation for large-scale retrieval of vulnerability-witnessing tests, enabling future AI models to better understand and generate security unit tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the MSR 2026 Technical Track.
