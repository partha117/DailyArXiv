| **[Towards AI-Native Software Engineering (SE 3.0): A Vision and a Challenge Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06107v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI-assisted software engineering (SE 2.0), powered by Foundation Models (FMs) and FM-powered coding assistants, has shown promise in improving developer productivity. However, it has also exposed inherent limitations, such as cognitive overload on developers and inefficiencies. We propose a shift towards Software Engineering 3.0 (SE 3.0), an AI-native approach characterized by intent-centric, conversation-oriented development between human developers and AI teammates. SE 3.0 envisions AI systems evolving beyond task-driven copilots into intelligent collaborators, capable of deeply understanding and reasoning about software engineering principles and intents. We outline the key components of the SE 3.0 technology stack, which includes Teammate.next for adaptive and personalized AI partnership, IDE.next for intent-centric conversation-oriented development, Compiler.next for multi-objective code synthesis, and Runtime.next for SLA-aware execution with edge-computing support. Our vision addresses the inefficiencies and cognitive strain of SE 2.0 by fostering a symbiotic relationship between human developers and AI, maximizing their complementary strengths. We also present a roadmap of challenges that must be overcome to realize our vision of SE 3.0. This paper lays the foundation for future discussions on the role of AI in the next era of software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19153v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs aid in assessing the validity of arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic empirical evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs - although lacking soundness guarantees - can be surprisingly effective at predicting the (in)validity of complex properties, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSR: Safeguarding Staking Rewards by Defining and Detecting Logical Defects in DeFi Staking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05827v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) staking is one of the most prominent applications within the DeFi ecosystem, where DeFi projects enable users to stake tokens on the platform and reward participants with additional tokens. However, logical defects in DeFi staking could enable attackers to claim unwarranted rewards by manipulating reward amounts, repeatedly claiming rewards, or engaging in other malicious actions. To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR. The results indicate that SSR achieves an overall precision of 92.31%, a recall of 87.92%, and an F1-score of 88.85%. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of logical defects in real-world smart contracts, we compiled a large-scale dataset of 15,992 DeFi staking contracts. SSR detected that 3,557 (22.24%) of these contracts contained at least one logical defect.</p></details> |  |
| **[EET: Experience-Driven Early Termination for Cost-Efficient Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05777v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineering (SE) agents powered by large language models are increasingly adopted in practice, yet they often incur substantial monetary cost. We introduce EET, an experience-driven early termination approach that reduces the cost of SE agents while preserving task performance. EET extracts structured experience from prior issue-resolution executions and leverages it to guide early termination during patch generation and selection, reducing unproductive iterations. We evaluate EET on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark across three representative SE agents. EET consistently reduces total cost by 19%-55% (32% on average), with negligible loss in resolution rate (at most 0.2%). These efficiency gains are achieved, on average, by identifying early-termination opportunities for 11% of issues and reducing API calls, input tokens, and output tokens by 21%, 30%, and 25%, respectively. We release the code, prompts, and data at https://github.com/EffiSEAgent/EET.</p></details> |  |
| **[StriderSPD: Structure-Guided Joint Representation Learning for Binary Security Patch Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05772v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerabilities severely threaten software systems, making the timely application of security patches crucial for mitigating attacks. However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \underline{Str}ucture-gu\underline{ide}d joint \underline{r}epresentation \underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoMonitor-Bench: Evaluating the Reliability of LLM-Based Misbehavior Monitor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05752v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutoMonitor-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of LLM-based misbehavior monitors across diverse tasks and failure modes. AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.</p></details> |  |

However, logical defects in DeFi staking could enable attackers to claim unwarranted rewards by manipulating reward amounts, repeatedly claiming rewards, or engaging in other malicious actions. To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR. The results indicate that SSR achieves an overall precision of 92.31%, a recall of 87.92%, and an F1-score of 88.85%. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of logical defects in real-world smart contracts, we compiled a large-scale dataset of 15,992 DeFi staking contracts. SSR detected that 3,557 (22.24%) of these contracts contained at least one logical defect.</p></details> |  |

We introduce EET, an experience-driven early termination approach that reduces the cost of SE agents while preserving task performance. EET extracts structured experience from prior issue-resolution executions and leverages it to guide early termination during patch generation and selection, reducing unproductive iterations. We evaluate EET on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark across three representative SE agents. EET consistently reduces total cost by 19%-55% (32% on average), with negligible loss in resolution rate (at most 0.2%). These efficiency gains are achieved, on average, by identifying early-termination opportunities for 11% of issues and reducing API calls, input tokens, and output tokens by 21%, 30%, and 25%, respectively. We release the code, prompts, and data at https://github.com/EffiSEAgent/EET.</p></details> |  |

However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \underline{Str}ucture-gu\underline{ide}d joint \underline{r}epresentation \underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.</p></details> |  |

AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.</p></details> |  |

However, it has also exposed inherent limitations, such as cognitive overload on developers and inefficiencies. We propose a shift towards Software Engineering 3.0 (SE 3.0), an AI-native approach characterized by intent-centric, conversation-oriented development between human developers and AI teammates. SE 3.0 envisions AI systems evolving beyond task-driven copilots into intelligent collaborators, capable of deeply understanding and reasoning about software engineering principles and intents. We outline the key components of the SE 3.0 technology stack, which includes Teammate.next for adaptive and personalized AI partnership, IDE.next for intent-centric conversation-oriented development, Compiler.next for multi-objective code synthesis, and Runtime.next for SLA-aware execution with edge-computing support. Our vision addresses the inefficiencies and cognitive strain of SE 2.0 by fostering a symbiotic relationship between human developers and AI, maximizing their complementary strengths. We also present a roadmap of challenges that must be overcome to realize our vision of SE 3.0. This paper lays the foundation for future discussions on the role of AI in the next era of software engineering.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR. The results indicate that SSR achieves an overall precision of 92.31%, a recall of 87.92%, and an F1-score of 88.85%. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of logical defects in real-world smart contracts, we compiled a large-scale dataset of 15,992 DeFi staking contracts. SSR detected that 3,557 (22.24%) of these contracts contained at least one logical defect.</p></details> |  |

We introduce EET, an experience-driven early termination approach that reduces the cost of SE agents while preserving task performance. EET extracts structured experience from prior issue-resolution executions and leverages it to guide early termination during patch generation and selection, reducing unproductive iterations. We evaluate EET on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark across three representative SE agents. EET consistently reduces total cost by 19%-55% (32% on average), with negligible loss in resolution rate (at most 0.2%). These efficiency gains are achieved, on average, by identifying early-termination opportunities for 11% of issues and reducing API calls, input tokens, and output tokens by 21%, 30%, and 25%, respectively. We release the code, prompts, and data at https://github.com/EffiSEAgent/EET.</p></details> |  |

However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \underline{Str}ucture-gu\underline{ide}d joint \underline{r}epresentation \underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.</p></details> |  |

AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.</p></details> |  |

However, it has also exposed inherent limitations, such as cognitive overload on developers and inefficiencies. We propose a shift towards Software Engineering 3.0 (SE 3.0), an AI-native approach characterized by intent-centric, conversation-oriented development between human developers and AI teammates. SE 3.0 envisions AI systems evolving beyond task-driven copilots into intelligent collaborators, capable of deeply understanding and reasoning about software engineering principles and intents. We outline the key components of the SE 3.0 technology stack, which includes Teammate.next for adaptive and personalized AI partnership, IDE.next for intent-centric conversation-oriented development, Compiler.next for multi-objective code synthesis, and Runtime.next for SLA-aware execution with edge-computing support. Our vision addresses the inefficiencies and cognitive strain of SE 2.0 by fostering a symbiotic relationship between human developers and AI, maximizing their complementary strengths. We also present a roadmap of challenges that must be overcome to realize our vision of SE 3.0. This paper lays the foundation for future discussions on the role of AI in the next era of software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.</p></details> |  |

While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs aid in assessing the validity of arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic empirical evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs - although lacking soundness guarantees - can be surprisingly effective at predicting the (in)validity of complex properties, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.</p></details> |  |

However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \underline{Str}ucture-gu\underline{ide}d joint \underline{r}epresentation \underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.</p></details> |  |

AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.</p></details> |  |

However, it has also exposed inherent limitations, such as cognitive overload on developers and inefficiencies. We propose a shift towards Software Engineering 3.0 (SE 3.0), an AI-native approach characterized by intent-centric, conversation-oriented development between human developers and AI teammates. SE 3.0 envisions AI systems evolving beyond task-driven copilots into intelligent collaborators, capable of deeply understanding and reasoning about software engineering principles and intents. We outline the key components of the SE 3.0 technology stack, which includes Teammate.next for adaptive and personalized AI partnership, IDE.next for intent-centric conversation-oriented development, Compiler.next for multi-objective code synthesis, and Runtime.next for SLA-aware execution with edge-computing support. Our vision addresses the inefficiencies and cognitive strain of SE 2.0 by fostering a symbiotic relationship between human developers and AI, maximizing their complementary strengths. We also present a roadmap of challenges that must be overcome to realize our vision of SE 3.0. This paper lays the foundation for future discussions on the role of AI in the next era of software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.</p></details> |  |

While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs aid in assessing the validity of arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic empirical evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs - although lacking soundness guarantees - can be surprisingly effective at predicting the (in)validity of complex properties, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.</p></details> |  |

However, logical defects in DeFi staking could enable attackers to claim unwarranted rewards by manipulating reward amounts, repeatedly claiming rewards, or engaging in other malicious actions. To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR. The results indicate that SSR achieves an overall precision of 92.31%, a recall of 87.92%, and an F1-score of 88.85%. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of logical defects in real-world smart contracts, we compiled a large-scale dataset of 15,992 DeFi staking contracts. SSR detected that 3,557 (22.24%) of these contracts contained at least one logical defect.</p></details> |  |

AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.</p></details> |  |
