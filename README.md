| **[Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |
| **[Multi-objective optimisation via the R2 utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11774v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of multi-objective optimisation is to identify a collection of points which describe the best possible trade-offs between the multiple objectives. In order to solve this vector-valued optimisation problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarisation functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarised problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimisation techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimisation problem into a single-objective optimisation problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem are the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarised optimisation problems. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimisation algorithms. We then analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimisation, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Review 2025. 47 pages.

| **[EcoAgent: An Efficient Edge-Cloud Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Mobile Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05440v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated detection of underdiagnosed medical conditions via opportunistic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11686v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artifact Sharing for Information Retrieval Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05434v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharing artifacts -- such as trained models, pre-built indexes, and the code to use them -- aids in reproducibility efforts by allowing researchers to validate intermediate steps and improves the sustainability of research by allowing multiple groups to build off one another's prior computational work. Although there are de facto consensuses on how to share research code (through a git repository linked to from publications) and trained models (via HuggingFace Hub), there is no consensus for other types of artifacts, such as built indexes. Given the practical utility of using shared indexes, researchers have resorted to self-hosting these resources or performing ad hoc file transfers upon request, ultimately limiting the artifacts' discoverability and reuse. This demonstration introduces a flexible and interoperable way to share artifacts for Information Retrieval research, improving both their accessibility and usability.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 (demo) |
| **[TokLIP: Marry Visual Tokens to CLIP for Multimodal Comprehension and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05422v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Uncertainty Comes for Free: Human-in-the-Loop Policies with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01876v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-in-the-loop (HitL) robot deployment has gained significant attention in both academia and industry as a semi-autonomous paradigm that enables human operators to intervene and adjust robot behaviors at deployment time, improving success rates. However, continuous human monitoring and intervention can be highly labor-intensive and impractical when deploying a large number of robots. To address this limitation, we propose a method that allows diffusion policies to actively seek human assistance only when necessary, reducing reliance on constant human oversight. To achieve this, we leverage the generative process of diffusion policies to compute an uncertainty-based metric based on which the autonomous agent can decide to request operator assistance at deployment time, without requiring any operator interaction during training. Additionally, we show that the same method can be used for efficient data collection for fine-tuning diffusion policies in order to improve their autonomous performance. Experimental results from simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our approach enhances policy performance during deployment for a variety of scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 30 figures.

| **[Hide & Seek: Transformer Symmetries Obscure Sharpness & Riemannian Geometry Finds It](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05409v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of sharpness has been successfully applied to traditional architectures like MLPs and CNNs to predict their generalization. For transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities. Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crosslingual Reasoning through Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05408v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representing spherical tensors with scalar-based machine-learning models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05404v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors. The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to implement, and accurate in practical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Pain Assessment Framework based on multimodal data and Deep Machine Learning methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05396v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From the original abstract: This thesis initially aims to study the pain assessment process from a clinical-theoretical perspective while exploring and examining existing automatic approaches. Building on this foundation, the primary objective of this Ph.D. project is to develop innovative computational methods for automatic pain assessment that achieve high performance and are applicable in real clinical settings. A primary goal is to thoroughly investigate and assess significant factors, including demographic elements that impact pain perception, as recognized in pain research, through a computational standpoint. Within the limits of the available data in this research area, our goal was to design, develop, propose, and offer automatic pain assessment pipelines for unimodal and multimodal configurations that are applicable to the specific requirements of different scenarios. The studies published in this Ph.D. thesis showcased the effectiveness of the proposed methods, achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, they paved the way for exploring new approaches in artificial intelligence, foundation models, and generative artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiC-LM: A Web-Scale Benchmark for Time-Continual LLM Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02107v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on historical web data inevitably become outdated. We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |
| **[Threshold Modulation for Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05375v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025. \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages) and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16381v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update 08.05.2025: Added some intermediate steps in the derivation of the loss to add clarity.

| **[Enhancing Differential Testing With LLMs For Testing Deep Learning Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07944v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by ACM TOSEM.

| **[Rethinking Video Super-Resolution: Towards Diffusion-Based Methods without Motion Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03355v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we rethink the approach to video super-resolution by introducing a method based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework, combined with an unconditional video diffusion transformer operating in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards the Worst-case Robustness of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19040v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial attacks, where adversaries craft specific input sequences to induce harmful, violent, private, or incorrect outputs. In this work, we study their worst-case robustness, i.e., whether an adversarial example exists that leads to such undesirable outputs. We upper bound the worst-case robustness using stronger white-box attacks, indicating that most current deterministic defenses achieve nearly 0\% worst-case robustness. We propose a general tight lower bound for randomized smoothing using fractional knapsack solvers or 0-1 knapsack solvers, and using them to bound the worst-case robustness of all stochastic defenses. Based on these solvers, we provide theoretical lower bounds for several previous empirical defenses. For example, we certify the robustness of a specific case, smoothing using a uniform kernel, against \textit{any possible attack} with an average $\ell_0$ perturbation of 2.02 or an average suffix length of 6.41.</p></details> |  |

The absence of comprehensive best practices for feature toggle usage often results in improper implementation, causing code quality issues. Although certain feature toggle usage patterns are prone to toggle smells, there is no tool as of today for software engineers to detect toggle usage patterns from the source code. This paper presents a tool TS-Detector to detect five different toggle usage patterns across ten open-source software projects in six different programming languages. We conducted a manual evaluation and results show that the true positive rates of detecting Spread, Nested, and Dead toggles are 80%, 86.4%, and 66.6% respectively, and the true negative rate of Mixed and Enum usages was 100%.

| **[Scalable Chain of Thoughts via Elastic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05315v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoUni: A Unified Model for Generating Geometry Diagrams, Problems and Problem Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10146v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GeoUni, the first unified geometry expert model capable of generating problem solutions and diagrams within a single framework in a way that enables the creation of unique and individualized geometry problems. Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Ophthalmology Foundation Models for Clinically Significant Age Macular Degeneration Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05291v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Morphologically Symmetric Reinforcement Learning for Ambidextrous Bimanual Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05287v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation skills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands. Bimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and coordination.

Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly. Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5 MTL task-weighting strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Connection Between Learning to Reject and Bhattacharyya Divergences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05273v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to abstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an ideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a hypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal distribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that rejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Two-Sample Test of Text Generation Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05269v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in digitized text data requires reliable inferential methods on observed textual patterns. This article proposes a novel two-sample text test for comparing similarity between two groups of documents. The hypothesis is whether the probabilistic mapping generating the textual data is identical across two groups of documents. The proposed test aims to assess text similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set. We showed theoretically that under mild conditions, the test statistic asymptotically follows a normal distribution. A multiple data-splitting strategy is proposed to enhance test power, which combines p-values into a unified decision. Various simulation studies and a real data example demonstrated that the proposed two-sample text test maintains the nominal Type one error rate while offering greater power compared to existing methods. The proposed method provides a novel solution to assert differences in document classes, particularly in fields where large-scale textual information is crucial.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on latent variables for generation. For experimental design or creative applications that require more control over the generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g. interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Linear combinations of Latent variables (LOL) as a general-purpose method to form linear combinations of latent variables that adhere to the assumptions of the generative model. As LOL is easy to implement and naturally addresses the broader task of forming any linear combinations, e.g. the construction of subspaces of the latent space, LOL dramatically simplifies the creation of expressive low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

To that aim, we generated a database with 996 entries, which includes up to 7 variables regarding both the manufacturing process and environmental conditions for more than 180 days. Then, we relied on a software framework that brings together a conglomeration of automated ML protocols that execute sequentially against our database by simply command-line interface. This easily permits hyper-optimizing and randomizing seeds of the ML models through exhaustive benchmarking so that optimal models are obtained. The accuracy achieved reaches values of the coefficient determination (R2) widely exceeding 0.90, whereas the root mean squared error (RMSE), sum of squared error (SSE), and mean absolute error (MAE)>1% of the target value, the PCE. Additionally, we contribute with validated models able to screen the behavior of OSCs never seen in the database. In that case, R2~0.96-0.97 and RMSE~1%, thus confirming the reliability of the proposal to predict. For comparative purposes, classical Bayesian regression fitting based on non-linear mean squares (LMS) are also presented, which only perform sufficiently for univariate cases of single OSCs. Hence they fail to outperform the breadth of the capabilities shown by the ML models. Finally, thanks to the standardized results offered by the ML framework, we study the dependencies between the variables of the dataset and their implications for the optimal performance and stability of the OSCs. Reproducibility is ensured by a standardized report altogether with the dataset, which are publicly available at Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Symbolic World Models via Test-time Scaling of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04728v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving complex planning problems requires Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly model the state transition to avoid rule violations, comply with constraints, and ensure optimality-a task hindered by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50\% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR2025 (32 pages, 6 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Treatment Effect Estimation via Active Learning: A Counterfactual Covering Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05242v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although numerous complex algorithms for treatment effect estimation have been developed in recent years, their effectiveness remains limited when handling insufficiently labeled training sets due to the high cost of labeling the effect after treatment, e.g., expensive tumor imaging or biopsy procedures needed to evaluate treatment effects. Therefore, it becomes essential to actively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a constrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect estimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis within the active learning context, where the derived key measures -- \textit{factual} and \textit{counterfactual covering radius} determine the risk upper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction algorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To generalize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which transforms the optimization objective into the \textit{Factual} and \textit{Counterfactual Coverage Maximization} to ensure effective radius reduction during data acquisition. Furthermore, benchmarking FCCM against other baselines demonstrates its superiority across both fully synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML'25 |
| **[Jailbreaking and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15236v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by advancing natural language understanding and generation, enabling applications across fields beyond healthcare, software engineering, and conversational systems. Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latte: Transfering LLMs` Latent-level Knowledge for Few-shot Tabular Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05237v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot tabular learning, in which machine learning models are trained with a limited amount of labeled data, provides a cost-effective approach to addressing real-world challenges. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer-based assignment decision network for multiple object tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03571v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/psaltaath/tadn-mot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

To support advancements in chemistry-focused natural language processing (NLP), we present ChemRxivQuest, a curated dataset of 970 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs derived from 155 ChemRxiv preprints across 17 subfields of chemistry. Each QA pair is explicitly linked to its source text segment to ensure traceability and contextual accuracy. ChemRxivQuest was constructed using an automated pipeline that combines optical character recognition (OCR), GPT-4o-based QA generation, and a fuzzy matching technique for answer verification. The dataset emphasizes conceptual, mechanistic, applied, and experimental questions, enabling applications in retrieval-based QA systems, search engine development, and fine-tuning of domain-adapted large language models. We analyze the dataset's structure, coverage, and limitations, and outline future directions for expansion and expert validation.

We design suitable resource management techniques that can simultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale appropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such models are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their training reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such, GFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that update the surrogate model and swiftly discover suitable solutions. We provide simulation results showing that our method can allocate radio resources achieving 20% performance gains against benchmarks, while requiring less than half of the number of acquisition rounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAPSO: A Unified Optimization View for Learning-Augmented Power System Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05203v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the lack of large-scale, diverse, and standardized datasets tailored to physics-based simulations. While existing initiatives provide valuable contributions, many are limited in scope-focusing on specific physics domains, relying on fragmented tooling, or adhering to overly simplistic datamodels that restrict generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce PLAID (Physics-Learning AI Datamodel), a flexible and extensible framework for representing and sharing datasets of physics simulations. PLAID defines a unified standard for describing simulation data and is accompanied by a library for creating, reading, and manipulating complex datasets across a wide range of physical use cases (gitlab.com/drti/plaid). We release six carefully crafted datasets under the PLAID standard, covering structural mechanics and computational fluid dynamics, and provide baseline benchmarks using representative learning methods. Benchmarking tools are made available on Hugging Face, enabling direct participation by the community and contribution to ongoing evaluation efforts (huggingface.co/PLAIDcompetitions).</p></details> |  |

This assumption often fails under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization. To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

These physical constraints cannot be fully addressed through advancements in control algorithms alone. Drawing inspiration from the winged flying squirrel, this paper proposes a highly maneuverable drone equipped with agility-enhancing foldable wings. By leveraging collaborative control between the conventional propeller system and the foldable wings-coordinated through the Thrust-Wing Coordination Control (TWCC) framework-the controllable acceleration set is expanded, enabling the generation of abrupt vertical forces that are unachievable with traditional wingless drones. The complex aerodynamics of the foldable wings are modeled using a physics-assisted recurrent neural network (paRNN), which calibrates the angle of attack (AOA) to align with the real aerodynamic behavior of the wings. The additional air resistance generated by appropriately deploying these wings significantly improves the tracking performance of the proposed "flying squirrel" drone. The model is trained on real flight data and incorporates flat-plate aerodynamic principles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed flying squirrel drone achieves a 13.1% improvement in tracking performance, as measured by root mean square error (RMSE), compared to a conventional wingless drone.

The agent under consideration is a price taker who has access only to the stock and factor value processes and the instantaneous volatility. We propose an auxiliary problem in which the agent can invoke policy randomization according to a specific class of Gaussian distributions, and prove that the mean of its optimal Gaussian policy solves the original Merton problem. With randomized policies, we are in the realm of continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) recently developed in Wang et al. (2020) and Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2022b, 2023), enabling us to solve the auxiliary problem in a data-driven way without having to estimate the model primitives. Specifically, we establish a policy improvement theorem based on which we design both online and offline actor-critic RL algorithms for learning Merton's strategies. A key insight from this study is that RL in general and policy randomization in particular are useful beyond the purpose for exploration -- they can be employed as a technical tool to solve a problem that cannot be otherwise solved by mere deterministic policies. At last, we carry out both simulation and empirical studies in a stochastic volatility environment to demonstrate the decisive outperformance of the devised RL algorithms in comparison to the conventional model-based, plug-in method.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Factors like multipath interference and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations, which also results in reduced execution time and smaller model size. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a single-layer perceptron. This enables seamless transitions between specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing accuracy and computational complexity. We design three low-complex models tailored for distinct scenarios, and a router that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station and compared to more general models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p></details> |  |

The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Accpeted |

However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively.

In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2). What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics.

Domain knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid') and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory: Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role: Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension; LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory, detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy. Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference; Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets; Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dukawalla: Voice Interfaces for Small Businesses in Africa](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05170v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small and medium sized businesses often struggle with data driven decision making do to a lack of advanced analytics tools, especially in African countries where they make up a majority of the workforce. Though many tools exist they are not designed to fit into the ways of working of SMB workers who are mobile first, have limited time to learn new workflows, and for whom social and business are tightly coupled. To address this, the Dukawalla prototype was created. This intelligent assistant bridges the gap between raw business data, and actionable insights by leveraging voice interaction and the power of generative AI. Dukawalla provides an intuitive way for business owners to interact with their data, aiding in informed decision making. This paper examines Dukawalla's deployment across SMBs in Nairobi, focusing on their experiences using this voice based assistant to streamline data collection and provide business insights</p></details> |  |

| **[Benchmarking Open-Source Large Language Models on Healthcare Text Classification Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15169v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of large language models (LLMs) to healthcare information extraction has emerged as a promising approach. This study evaluates the classification performance of five open-source LLMs: GEMMA-3-27B-IT, LLAMA3-70B, LLAMA4-109B, DEEPSEEK-R1-DISTILL-LLAMA-70B, and DEEPSEEK-V3-0324-UD-Q2_K_XL, across six healthcare-related classification tasks involving both social media data (breast cancer, changes in medication regimen, adverse pregnancy outcomes, potential COVID-19 cases) and clinical data (stigma labeling, medication change discussion). We report precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals for all model-task combinations. Our findings reveal significant performance variability between LLMs, with DeepSeekV3 emerging as the strongest overall performer, achieving the highest F1 scores in four tasks. Notably, models generally performed better on social media tasks compared to clinical data tasks, suggesting potential domain-specific challenges. GEMMA-3-27B-IT demonstrated exceptionally high recall despite its smaller parameter count, while LLAMA4-109B showed surprisingly underwhelming performance compared to its predecessor LLAMA3-70B, indicating that larger parameter counts do not guarantee improved classification results. We observed distinct precision-recall trade-offs across models, with some favoring sensitivity over specificity and vice versa. These findings highlight the importance of task-specific model selection for healthcare applications, considering the particular data domain and precision-recall requirements rather than model size alone. As healthcare increasingly integrates AI-driven text classification tools, this comprehensive benchmarking provides valuable guidance for model selection and implementation while underscoring the need for continued evaluation and domain adaptation of LLMs in healthcare contexts.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, recent research highlights that deterministic embeddings from standard VLMs often struggle to capture the uncertainties arising from the ambiguities in visual and textual descriptions and the multiple possible correspondences between images and texts. Existing approaches tackle this by learning probabilistic embeddings during VLM training, which demands large datasets and does not leverage the powerful representations already learned by large-scale VLMs like CLIP. In this paper, we propose GroVE, a post-hoc approach to obtaining probabilistic embeddings from frozen VLMs. GroVE builds on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) to learn a shared low-dimensional latent space where image and text inputs are mapped to a unified representation, optimized through single-modal embedding reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. Once trained, the Gaussian Process model generates uncertainty-aware probabilistic embeddings. Evaluation shows that GroVE achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty calibration across multiple downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and active learning.</p></details> | UAI 2025, 22 pages |
| **[Overcoming Dimensional Factorization Limits in Discrete Diffusion Models through Quantum Joint Distribution Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05151v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |

We demonstrate, via real data analysis, that common differentially private multivariate mean estimators may not perform well as the aggregator, even in large datasets, motivating our developments.We show that the modified winsorized mean is minimax optimal for several, large classes of distributions, even under adversarial contamination. We also demonstrate that, empirically, the private modified winsorized mean performs well compared to other private mean estimates. We consider the modified winsorized mean as the aggregator in subsample-and-aggregate, deriving a finite sample deviations bound for a subsample-and-aggregate estimate generated with the new aggregator. This result yields two important insights: (i) the optimal choice of subsamples depends on the bias of the estimator computed on the subsamples, and (ii) the rate of convergence of the subsample-and-aggregate estimator depends on the robustness of the estimator computed on the subsamples.</p></details> | 45 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Recursive Inference Scaling: A Winning Path to Scalable Inference in Language and Multimodal Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07503v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time in language and multimodal systems. RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Training from Random Initialization: Aligning Lottery Ticket Masks using Weight Symmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05143v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests there exists a sparse LTH mask and weights that achieve the same generalization performance as the dense model while using significantly fewer parameters. However, finding a LTH solution is computationally expensive, and a LTH sparsity mask does not generalize to other random weight initializations. Recent work has suggested that neural networks trained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo permutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss basin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks do not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH mask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training from a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in generalization when sparse training from random initialization with the permuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and ResNet50).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Here we introduce "Not Another Imputation Method" (NAIM), a novel transformer-based model specifically designed to address this issue without the need for traditional imputation techniques. NAIM's ability to avoid the necessity of imputing missing values and to effectively learn from available data relies on two main techniques: the use of feature-specific embeddings to encode both categorical and numerical features also handling missing inputs; the modification of the masked self-attention mechanism to completely mask out the contributions of missing data. Additionally, a novel regularization technique is introduced to enhance the model's generalization capability from incomplete data. We extensively evaluated NAIM on 5 publicly available tabular datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over 6 state-of-the-art machine learning models and 5 deep learning models, each paired with 3 different imputation techniques when necessary. The results highlight the efficacy of NAIM in improving predictive performance and resilience in the presence of missing data. To facilitate further research and practical application in handling missing data without traditional imputation methods, we made the code for NAIM available at https://github.com/cosbidev/NAIM.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Role of Search Budgets in Model-Based Software Refactoring Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15179v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software model optimization is a process that automatically generates design alternatives aimed at improving quantifiable non-functional properties of software systems, such as performance and reliability. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms effectively help designers identify trade-offs among the desired non-functional properties. To reduce the use of computational resources, this work examines the impact of implementing a search budget to limit the search for design alternatives. In particular, we analyze how time budgets affect the quality of Pareto fronts by utilizing quality indicators and exploring the structural features of the generated design alternatives. This study identifies distinct behavioral differences among evolutionary algorithms when a search budget is implemented. It further reveals that design alternatives generated under a budget are structurally different from those produced without one. Additionally, we offer recommendations for designers on selecting algorithms in relation to time constraints, thereby facilitating the effective application of automated refactoring to improve non-functional properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.08385</p></details> |
| **[Pairwise Markov Chains for Volatility Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11838v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Pairwise Markov Chain (PMC) is a probabilistic graphical model extending the well-known Hidden Markov Model. This model, although highly effective for many tasks, has been scarcely utilized for continuous value prediction. This is mainly due to the issue of modeling observations inherent in generative probabilistic models. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for prediction with the PMC. On the one hand, this algorithm allows circumventing the feature problem, thus fully exploiting the capabilities of the PMC. On the other hand, it enables the PMC to extend any predictive model by introducing hidden states, updated at each time step, and allowing the introduction of non-stationarity for any model. We apply the PMC with its new algorithm for volatility forecasting, which we compare to the highly popular GARCH(1,1) and feedforward neural models across numerous pairs. This is particularly relevant given the regime changes that we can observe in volatility. For each scenario, our algorithm enhances the performance of the extended model, demonstrating the value of our approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming OOD Actions for Offline Reinforcement Learning: An Advantage-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05126v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function. Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear margins on the more challenging tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combating Confirmation Bias: A Unified Pseudo-Labeling Framework for Entity Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02075v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity. To circumvent the shortage of seed alignments provided for training, recent EA models utilize pseudo-labeling strategies to iteratively add unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence to the seed alignments for model training. However, the adverse impact of confirmation bias during pseudo-labeling has been largely overlooked, thus hindering entity alignment performance. To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to determine entity correspondences and reduce erroneous matches across two KGs. An effective criterion is derived to infer pseudo-labeled alignments that satisfy one-to-one correspondences; (2) Parallel pseudo-label ensembling refines pseudo-labeled alignments by combining predictions over multiple models independently trained in parallel. The ensembled pseudo-labeled alignments are thereafter used to augment seed alignments to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. Our extensive results and in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of UPL-EA over 15 competitive baselines and its utility as a general pseudo-labeling framework for entity alignment.</p></details> |  |

While recent reinforcement learning (RL) solvers have shown promise, they require retraining for each new profile distribution, suffer from poor representation ability, and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution instances. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing USPR (Unified Solver for Profiled Routing), a novel framework that natively handles arbitrary profile types. USPR introduces three key innovations: (i) Profile Embeddings (PE) to encode any combination of profile types; (ii) Multi-Head Profiled Attention (MHPA), an attention mechanism that models rich interactions between vehicles and clients; (iii) Profile-aware Score Reshaping (PSR), which dynamically adjusts decoder logits using profile scores to improve generalization. Empirical results on diverse PVRP benchmarks demonstrate that USPR achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based methods while offering significant gains in flexibility and computational efficiency. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/uspr.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Text2Cypher with Schema Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05118v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs represent complex data using nodes, relationships, and properties. Cypher, a powerful query language for graph databases, enables efficient modeling and querying. Recent advancements in large language models allow translation of natural language questions into Cypher queries - Text2Cypher. A common approach is incorporating database schema into prompts. However, complex schemas can introduce noise, increase hallucinations, and raise computational costs. Schema filtering addresses these challenges by including only relevant schema elements, improving query generation while reducing token costs. This work explores various schema filtering methods for Text2Cypher task and analyzes their impact on token length, performance, and cost. Results show that schema filtering effectively optimizes Text2Cypher, especially for smaller models. Consistent with prior research, we find that larger models benefit less from schema filtering due to their longer context capabilities. However, schema filtering remains valuable for both larger and smaller models in cost reduction.</p></details> |  |

(2025), I show that within their suite of research-engineering tasks the performance of AI agents on longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical model -- a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do the task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length of the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life. This empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent at different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the data is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that they involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails the task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is unknown and an important subject for further work.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

The scarcity of labeled ECG data coupled with the diverse nature of clinical inquiries presents a significant challenge for developing robust and adaptable ECG diagnostic systems. This work introduces a novel multimodal meta-learning method for few-shot ECG question answering, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data while leveraging the rich knowledge encoded within large language models (LLMs). Our LLM-agnostic approach integrates a pre-trained ECG encoder with a frozen LLM (e.g., LLaMA and Gemma) via a trainable fusion module, enabling the language model to reason about ECG data and generate clinically meaningful answers. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior generalization to unseen diagnostic tasks compared to supervised baselines, achieving notable performance even with limited ECG leads. For instance, in a 5-way 5-shot setting, our method using LLaMA-3.1-8B achieves an accuracy of 84.6%, 77.3%, and 69.6% on single verify, choose and query question types, respectively. These results highlight the potential of our method to enhance clinical ECG interpretation by combining signal processing with the nuanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs, particularly in data-constrained scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AHLI CHIL 2025</p></details> |

Early identification is necessary to prompt intervention, but it remains a challenging task. This study aims to address this challenge by combining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this discovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework that: a) constructs two networks based on disease coding, including the patient network and the disease difference network. Three comorbidity network features were generated based on the basic difference network to capture the potential relationship between comorbidities and risk diseases; b) incorporates computational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL was developed to predict the risks of diabetes and coronary heart disease in patients; and c) analysis the comorbidity patterns and exploring the pathways of disease progression, the pathological pathogenesis of diabetes and coronary heart disease may be revealed. The results show that the network features extracted based on the difference network are important, and the framework we proposed provides more accurate predictions than other strong models in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |

One such task is disparity estimation, estimating the disparity between matching pixels in stereo image pairs, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like medical surgeries and autonomous navigation. However, DL-based disparity estimation methods are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their reliability and generalization. Despite these concerns, a standardized benchmark for evaluating the robustness of disparity estimation methods remains absent, hindering progress in the field. To address this gap, we introduce DispBench, a comprehensive benchmarking tool for systematically assessing the reliability of disparity estimation methods. DispBench evaluates robustness against synthetic image corruptions such as adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution shifts caused by 2D Common Corruptions across multiple datasets and diverse corruption scenarios. We conduct the most extensive performance and robustness analysis of disparity estimation methods to date, uncovering key correlations between accuracy, reliability, and generalization.

| **[Type-Constrained Code Generation with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09246v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code generation. However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because their next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code. Although constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue, it has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or syntactic features of general-purpose programming languages. However, LLMs frequently generate code with typing errors, which are beyond the domain of syntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge, we introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems to guide code generation. For this purpose, we develop novel prefix automata and a search over inhabitable types, forming a sound approach to enforce well-typedness on LLM-generated code. We formalize our approach on a foundational simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate practicality. Our evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP datasets shows that our approach reduces compilation errors by more than half and significantly increases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair tasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including state-of-the-art open-weight models with more than 30B parameters. The results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach in constraining LLM code generation with formal rules of type systems.</p></details> |  |

The spectrum of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal, locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

These approaches typically fail to account for the cognitive processes that shape user preferences and decision-making. In this vision paper, we propose a hybrid user modeling framework based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R that integrates symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of human memory. Our goal is to combine ACT-R's declarative memory, which is responsible for storing symbolic chunks along sub-symbolic activations, with its procedural memory, which contains symbolic production rules. This integration will help simulate how users retrieve past experiences and apply decision-making strategies. With this approach, we aim to provide more transparent recommendations, enable rule-based explanations, and facilitate the modeling of cognitive biases. We argue that our approach has the potential to inform the design of a new generation of human-centered, psychology-informed recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the HyPer workshop, co-located with ACM UMAP 2025</p></details> |
| **[ItDPDM: Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05082v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while also achieving faster convergence.</p></details> | Pre-print |

However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed the uncertain reward models to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, and thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that can directly learn the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the uncertainty of the reward distribution. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final performance compared with existing methods. We also find that PURM genuinely produce sound reward and uncertainty estimations.

Compared to traditional IoT fields, CIoT differs notably in target users, product types, and design approaches. While offering convenience to users, it also raises new security and privacy concerns. Network traffic analysis, a widely used technique in the security community, has been extensively applied to investigate these concerns about CIoT. Compared to traditional network traffic analysis in fields like mobile apps and websites, CIoT introduces unique characteristics that pose new challenges and research opportunities. Researchers have made significant contributions in this area. To aid researchers in understanding the application of traffic analysis tools for assessing CIoT security and privacy risks, this survey reviews 310 publications on traffic analysis within the CIoT security and privacy domain from January 2018 to June 2024, focusing on three research questions. Our work: 1) outlines the CIoT traffic analysis process and highlights its differences from general network traffic analysis. 2) summarizes and classifies existing research into four categories according to its application objectives: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious traffic detection, and measurement. 3) explores emerging challenges and potential future research directions based on each step of the CIoT traffic analysis process. This will provide new insights to the community and guide the industry towards safer product designs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research predominantly concentrates on the security of general large language models, lacking specialized methodologies for establishing safety benchmarks and input moderation tailored to embodied agents. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel input moderation framework, meticulously designed to safeguard embodied agents. This framework encompasses the entire pipeline, including taxonomy definition, dataset curation, moderator architecture, model training, and rigorous evaluation. Notably, we introduce EAsafetyBench, a meticulously crafted safety benchmark engineered to facilitate both the training and stringent assessment of moderators specifically designed for embodied agents. Furthermore, we propose Pinpoint, an innovative prompt-decoupled input moderation scheme that harnesses a masked attention mechanism to effectively isolate and mitigate the influence of functional prompts on moderation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets and models validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve an impressive average detection accuracy of 94.58%, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques, alongside an exceptional moderation processing time of merely 0.002 seconds per instance.</p></details> | 9 pages |

To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance.

In this study, we propose WaveSleepNet, an interpretable neural network for sleep staging that reasons in a similar way to sleep experts. In this network, we utilize the latent space representations generated during training to identify characteristic wave prototypes corresponding to different sleep stages. The feature representation of an input signal is segmented into patches within the latent space, each of which is compared against the learned wave prototypes. The proximity between these patches and the wave prototypes is quantified through scores, indicating the prototypes' presence and relative proportion within the signal. The scores are served as the decision-making criteria for final sleep staging. During training, an ensemble of loss functions is employed for the prototypes' diversity and robustness. Furthermore, the learned wave prototypes are visualized by analysing occlusion sensitivity. The efficacy of WaveSleepNet is validated across three public datasets, achieving sleep staging performance that are on par with the state-of-the-art models when several WaveSleepNets are combine into a larger network. A detailed case study examined the decision-making process of the WaveSleepNet which aligns closely with American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual guidelines. Another case study systematically explained the misidentified reason behind each sleep stage. WaveSleepNet's transparent process provides specialists with direct access to the physiological significance of its criteria, allowing for future adaptation or enrichment by sleep experts.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

Despite their versatility, existing open-source unified models exhibit performance gaps against domain-specific architectures. To bridge this gap, we present Nexus-Gen, a unified model that synergizes the language reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the image synthesis power of diffusion models. To align the embedding space of the LLM and diffusion model, we conduct a dual-phase alignment training process. (1) The autoregressive LLM learns to predict image embeddings conditioned on multimodal inputs, while (2) the vision decoder is trained to reconstruct high-fidelity images from these embeddings. During training the LLM, we identified a critical discrepancy between the autoregressive paradigm's training and inference phases, where error accumulation in continuous embedding space severely degrades generation quality. To avoid this issue, we introduce a prefilled autoregression strategy that prefills input sequence with position-embedded special tokens instead of continuous embeddings. Through dual-phase training, Nexus-Gen has developed the integrated capability to comprehensively address the image understanding, generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and codes are published at https://github.com/modelscope/Nexus-Gen.git to facilitate further advancements across the field.</p></details> |  |

However, existing utility-centric unlearning metrics (based on model utility) may fail to accurately evaluate the extent of unlearning in realistic settings such as when (a) the forget and retain set have semantically similar content, (b) retraining the model from scratch on the retain set is impractical, and/or (c) the model owner can improve the unlearning metric without directly performing unlearning on the LLM. This paper presents the first data-centric unlearning metric for LLMs called WaterDrum that exploits robust text watermarking for overcoming these limitations. We also introduce new benchmark datasets for LLM unlearning that contain varying levels of similar data points and can be used to rigorously evaluate unlearning algorithms using WaterDrum. Our code is available at https://github.com/lululu008/WaterDrum and our new benchmark datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Glow-AI/WaterDrum-Ax.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish (Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most prior work has been limited to perplexity or basic knowledge tasks and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of recent models like Llama-3.3. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models spanning 1B to 405B parameters, applying four quantization methods across 13 datasets. Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in coding and STEM tasks, though reasoning may sometimes improve.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IJCAI 2025, 21 pages, 2 figure</p></details> |

This makes full automation with learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85% improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover, performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Methods, and Applications to Circuit Design (SMACD 2025). 4 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |

This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

Despite their impressive capabilities, they still face practical deployment issues, such as high inference costs, limited accessibility of proprietary LCMs, and adaptability issues of ultra-large LCMs. These issues highlight the critical need for more accessible, lightweight yet effective LCMs. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, which transfers the programming capabilities of larger, advanced LCMs to smaller, less powerful LCMs. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Paced knOwledge DistillAtion framework, named SODA, aiming at developing lightweight yet effective student LCMs. SODA consists of three stages in one cycle: (1) Correct-and-Fault Knowledge Delivery stage aims at improving the student models capability to recognize errors while ensuring its basic programming skill during the knowledge transferring, which involves correctness-aware supervised learning and fault-aware contrastive learning methods. (2) Multi-View Feedback stage aims at measuring the quality of results generated by the student model from two views, including model-based and static tool-based measurement, for identifying the difficult questions. (3) Feedback-based Knowledge Update stage aims at updating the student model adaptively by generating new questions at different difficulty levels, in which the difficulty levels are categorized based on the feedback in the second stage. Experimental results show that SODA improves the student model by 65.96% in terms of average Pass@1, outperforming the best baseline by 29.85%. Based on the SODA framework, we develop SodaCoder, a series of lightweight yet effective LCMs, which outperform 15 LCMs with less than or equal to 16B parameters. Notably, SodaCoder-DS-6.7B, built on DeepseekCoder-6.7B, even surpasses the prominent ChatGPT on average Pass@1.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 |

Advanced bundle recommendation models usually learn bundle representations from multiple views (e.g., interaction view) at both the bundle and item levels. Consequently, the cold-start problem for bundles is more challenging than that for traditional items due to the dual-level multi-view complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Diffusion Experts (MoDiffE) framework, which employs a divide-and-conquer strategy for cold-start bundle recommendation and follows three steps:(1) Divide: The bundle cold-start problem is divided into independent but similar sub-problems sequentially by level and view, which can be summarized as the poor representation of feature-missing bundles in prior-embedding models. (2) Conquer: Beyond prior-embedding models that fundamentally provide the embedded representations, we introduce a diffusion-based method to solve all sub-problems in a unified way, which directly generates diffusion representations using diffusion models without depending on specific features. (3) Combine: A cold-aware hierarchical Mixture of Experts (MoE) is employed to combine results of the sub-problems for final recommendations, where the two models for each view serve as experts and are adaptively fused for different bundles in a multi-layer manner. Additionally, MoDiffE adopts a multi-stage decoupled training pipeline and introduces a cold-start gating augmentation method to enable the training of gating for cold bundles. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MoDiffE significantly outperforms existing solutions in handling cold-start bundle recommendation. It achieves up to a 0.1027 absolute gain in Recall@20 in cold-start scenarios and up to a 47.43\% relative improvement in all-bundle scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Multi-LLM Repeated Sampling Efficiently Scales Test-Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00762v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the scalable problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs while underutilizing the advantage of on-device SLMs in accessing and processing personalized data. This leads to two interconnected issues: 1) Limited utilization of the problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs, which fail to align with personalized user-task needs, and 2) Inadequate integration of user data into on-device SLM responses, resulting in mismatches in contextual user information. In this paper, we propose a Leader-Subordinate Retrieval framework for Privacy-preserving cloud-device collaboration (LSRP), a novel solution that bridges these gaps by: 1) enhancing on-cloud LLM guidance to on-device SLM through a dynamic selection of task-specific leader strategies named as user-to-user retrieval-augmented generation (U-U-RAG), and 2) integrating the data advantages of on-device SLMs through small model feedback Direct Preference Optimization (SMFB-DPO) for aligning the on-cloud LLM with the on-device SLM. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that LSRP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving question-answer relevance and personalization, while preserving user privacy through efficient on-device retrieval.

| **[A Reputation System for Large Language Model-based Multi-agent Systems to Avoid the Tragedy of the Commons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05029v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tragedy of the commons, where individual self-interest leads to collectively disastrous outcomes, is a pervasive challenge in human society. Recent studies have demonstrated that similar phenomena can arise in generative multi-agent systems (MASs). To address this challenge, this paper explores the use of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic, dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for future interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet effectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining cooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can give rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.</p></details> |  |

A/B testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS, a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released publicly.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Generative Models for Long Time Series: Approximately Equivariant Recurrent Network Structures for an Adjusted Training Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05020v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet effective generative model for time series data based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with recurrent layers, referred to as the Recurrent Variational Autoencoder with Subsequent Training (RVAE-ST). Our method introduces an adapted training scheme that progressively increases the sequence length, addressing the challenge recurrent layers typically face when modeling long sequences. By leveraging the recurrent architecture, the model maintains a constant number of parameters regardless of sequence length. This design encourages approximate time-shift equivariance and enables efficient modeling of long-range temporal dependencies. Rather than introducing a fundamentally new architecture, we show that a carefully composed combination of known components can match or outperform state-of-the-art generative models on several benchmark datasets. Our model performs particularly well on time series that exhibit quasi-periodic structure,while remaining competitive on datasets with more irregular or partially non-stationary behavior. We evaluate its performance using ELBO, Fr\'echet Distance, discriminative scores, and visualizations of the learned embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Reliable Synthetic Clinical Trial Data: The Role of Hyperparameter Optimization and Domain Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05019v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of synthetic clinical trial data offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns and data accessibility limitations in medical research. However, ensuring that synthetic datasets maintain high fidelity, utility, and adherence to domain-specific constraints remains a key challenge. While hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been shown to improve generative model performance, the effectiveness of different optimization strategies for synthetic clinical data remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates four HPO strategies across eight generative models, comparing single-metric optimization against compound metric optimization approaches. Our results demonstrate that HPO consistently improves synthetic data quality, with TVAE, CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN+ achieving improvements of up to 60%, 39%, and 38%, respectively. Compound metric optimization outperformed single-metric strategies, producing more balanced and generalizable synthetic datasets. Interestingly, HPO alone is insufficient to ensure clinically valid synthetic data, as all models exhibited violations of fundamental survival constraints. Preprocessing and postprocessing played a crucial role in reducing these violations, as models lacking robust processing steps produced invalid data in up to 61% of cases. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge alongside HPO to create high quality synthetic datasets. Our study provides actionable recommendations for improving synthetic data generation, with future research needed to refine metric selection and validate these findings on larger datasets to enhance clinical applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Large-scale Generative Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04180v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in information retrieval. However, generative ranking systems are still understudied, particularly with respect to their effectiveness and feasibility in large-scale industrial settings. This paper investigates this topic at the ranking stage of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed, a recommender system that serves hundreds of millions of users. Specifically, we first examine how generative ranking outperforms current industrial recommenders. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we find that the primary improvement in effectiveness stems from the generative architecture, rather than the training paradigm. To facilitate efficient deployment of generative ranking, we introduce GenRank, a novel generative architecture for ranking. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution through online A/B experiments. The results show that GenRank achieves significant improvements in user satisfaction with nearly equivalent computational resources compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Pitfalls of Growing Group Complexity: LLMs and Social Choice-Based Aggregation for Group Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05016v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems aimed at both individuals and groups. Previously, Group Recommender Systems (GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in: Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP Adjunct '25), June 16--19, 2025, New York City, NY, USA Accepted at the 4th Workshop on Group Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (GMAP), co-located at UMAP 2025</p></details> |

This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data from five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time, and error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of keyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1) keyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication, and (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing fine-grained user-specific patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

In order to solve this vector-valued optimisation problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarisation functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarised problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimisation techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimisation problem into a single-objective optimisation problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem are the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarised optimisation problems. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimisation algorithms. We then analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimisation, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Review 2025. 47 pages.

While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.</p></details> | Technical Report |

However, continuous human monitoring and intervention can be highly labor-intensive and impractical when deploying a large number of robots. To address this limitation, we propose a method that allows diffusion policies to actively seek human assistance only when necessary, reducing reliance on constant human oversight. To achieve this, we leverage the generative process of diffusion policies to compute an uncertainty-based metric based on which the autonomous agent can decide to request operator assistance at deployment time, without requiring any operator interaction during training. Additionally, we show that the same method can be used for efficient data collection for fine-tuning diffusion policies in order to improve their autonomous performance. Experimental results from simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our approach enhances policy performance during deployment for a variety of scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 30 figures.

| **[Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05410v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.</p></details> |  |

For transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities. Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish (Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> |  |

While AI copilots assist adult programmers, few tools target children in block-based environments. Building on prior research \cite{druga_how_2021,druga2023ai, druga2023scratch}, we present Cognimates Scratch Copilot: an AI-powered assistant integrated into a Scratch-like environment, providing real-time support for ideation, code generation, debugging, and asset creation. This paper details the system architecture and findings from an exploratory qualitative evaluation with 18 international children (ages 7--12). Our analysis reveals how the AI Copilot supported key creative coding processes, particularly aiding ideation and debugging. Crucially, it also highlights how children actively negotiated the use of AI, demonstrating strong agency by adapting or rejecting suggestions to maintain creative control. Interactions surfaced design tensions between providing helpful scaffolding and fostering independent problem-solving, as well as learning opportunities arising from navigating AI limitations and errors. Findings indicate Cognimates Scratch Copilot's potential to enhance creative self-efficacy and engagement. Based on these insights, we propose initial design guidelines for AI coding assistants that prioritize youth agency and critical interaction alongside supportive scaffolding.</p></details> | 5 figures, 14 pages |

Two key open standards, Google's Agent to Agent (A2A) protocol for inter-agent communication and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool access, promise to overcome the limitations of fragmented, custom integration approaches. While their potential synergy is significant, this paper argues that effectively integrating A2A and MCP presents unique, emergent challenges at their intersection, particularly concerning semantic interoperability between agent tasks and tool capabilities, the compounded security risks arising from combined discovery and execution, and the practical governance required for the envisioned "Agent Economy". This work provides a critical analysis, moving beyond a survey to evaluate the practical implications and inherent difficulties of combining these horizontal and vertical integration standards. We examine the benefits (e.g., specialization, scalability) while critically assessing their dependencies and trade-offs in an integrated context. We identify key challenges increased by the integration, including novel security vulnerabilities, privacy complexities, debugging difficulties across protocols, and the need for robust semantic negotiation mechanisms. In summary, A2A+MCP offers a vital architectural foundation, but fully realizing its potential requires substantial advancements to manage the complexities of their combined operation.</p></details> |  |

However, current modeling approaches remain labor-intensive and prone to human errors due to their dependence on manual workflows. These processes typically involve extensive literature reviews, formula tuning, and iterative testing, which often lead to inefficiencies. To address this, we propose TR-Agent, an AI-powered framework that autonomously develops and refines traffic models through a closed-loop, iterative process. We structure the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation, theory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization, and implement TR-Agent with four corresponding modules. These modules collaborate to retrieve knowledge from external sources, generate novel hypotheses, implement and debug models, and evaluate their performance on evaluation datasets. Through iteratively feedback and refinement, TR-Agent improves both modeling efficiency and effectiveness. We validate the framework on three representative traffic models: the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for car-following behavior, the MOBIL model for lane-changing, and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) speed-density relationship for macroscopic traffic flow modeling. Experimental results show substantial performance gains over the original models. To assess the robustness and generalizability of the improvements, we conduct additional evaluations across multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent performance gains beyond the original development data. Furthermore, TR-Agent produces interpretable explanations for each improvement, enabling researchers to easily verify and extend its results. This makes TR-Agent a valuable assistant for traffic modeling refinement and a promising tool for broader applications in transportation research.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |
| **[Towards Source Mapping for Zero-Knowledge Smart Contracts: Design and Preliminary Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04322v4)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and auditing zero-knowledge-compatible smart contracts remains a significant challenge due to the lack of source mapping in compilers such as zkSolc. In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLPut: Investigating Large Language Models for Bug Report-Based Input Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20578v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failure-inducing inputs play a crucial role in diagnosing and analyzing software bugs. Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the AI-Lab Intervention: Impact on Student Perception and Use of Generative AI in Early Undergraduate Computer Science Courses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00100v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering courses at Purdue University. Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as well as qualitative narratives of student experiences. While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap" between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill development. These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 17 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |

Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Unmasking the Shadows: Pinpoint the Implementations of Anti-Dynamic Analysis Techniques in Malware Using LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05982v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sandboxes and other dynamic analysis processes are prevalent in malware detection systems nowadays to enhance the capability of detecting 0-day malware. Therefore, techniques of anti-dynamic analysis (TADA) are prevalent in modern malware samples, and sandboxes can suffer from false negatives and analysis failures when analyzing the samples with TADAs. In such cases, human reverse engineers will get involved in conducting dynamic analysis manually (i.e., debugging, patching), which in turn also gets obstructed by TADAs. In this work, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) based workflow that can pinpoint the location of the TADA implementation in the code, to help reverse engineers place breakpoints used in debugging. Our evaluation shows that we successfully identified the locations of 87.80% known TADA implementations adopted from public repositories. In addition, we successfully pinpoint the locations of TADAs in 4 well-known malware samples that are documented in online malware analysis blogs.</p></details> |  |
| **[RocketPPA: Ultra-Fast LLM-Based PPA Estimator at Code-Level Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21971v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have recently transformed hardware design, yet bridging the gap between code synthesis and PPA (power, performance, and area) estimation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that leverages a 21k dataset of thoroughly cleaned and synthesizable Verilog modules, each annotated with detailed power, delay, and area metrics. By employing chain-of-thought techniques, we automatically debug and curate this dataset to ensure high fidelity in downstream applications. We then fine-tune CodeLlama using LoRA-based parameter-efficient methods, framing the task as a regression problem to accurately predict PPA metrics from Verilog code. Furthermore, we augment our approach with a mixture-of-experts architecture-integrating both LoRA and an additional MLP expert layer-to further refine predictions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: power estimation accuracy is enhanced by 5.9% at a 20% error threshold and by 7.2% at a 10% threshold, delay estimation improves by 5.1% and 3.9%, and area estimation sees gains of 4% and 7.9% for the 20% and 10% thresholds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of the mixture-of-experts module contributes an additional 3--4% improvement across these tasks. Our results establish a new benchmark for PPA-aware Verilog generation, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated dataset and modeling strategies for next-generation EDA workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can You Mimic Me? Exploring the Use of Android Record & Replay Tools in Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20237v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android User Interface (UI) testing is a critical research area due to the ubiquity of apps and the challenges faced by developers. Record and replay (R&R) tools facilitate manual and automated UI testing by recording UI actions to execute test scenarios and replay bugs. These tools typically support (i) regression testing, (ii) non-crashing functional bug reproduction, and (iii) crashing bug reproduction. However, prior work only examines these tools in fragmented settings, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across common use cases. We address this gap by conducting an empirical study on using R&R tools to record and replay non-crashing failures, crashing bugs, and feature-based user scenarios, and explore combining R&R with automated input generation (AIG) tools to replay crashing bugs. Our study involves one industrial and three academic R&R tools, 34 scenarios from 17 apps, 90 non-crashing failures from 42 apps, and 31 crashing bugs from 17 apps. Results show that 17% of scenarios, 38% of non-crashing bugs, and 44% of crashing bugs cannot be reliably recorded and replayed, mainly due to action interval resolution, API incompatibility, and Android tooling limitations. Our findings highlight key future research directions to enhance the practical application of R&R tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MobileSoft 2025</p></details> |

Put some Whamm on it!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20192v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and monitoring programs are integral to engineering and deploying software. Dynamic analyses monitor applications through source code or IR injection, machine code or bytecode rewriting, and virtual machine or direct hardware support. While these techniques are viable within their respective domains, common tooling across techniques is rare, leading to fragmentation of skills, duplicated efforts, and inconsistent feature support. We address this problem in the WebAssembly ecosystem with Whamm, a declarative instrumentation DSL for WebAssembly that abstracts above the instrumentation strategy, leveraging bytecode rewriting and engine support as available. Whamm solves three problems: 1) tooling fragmentation, 2) prohibitive instrumentation overhead of general-purpose frameworks, and 3) tedium of tailoring low-level high-performance mechanisms. Whamm provides fully-programmable instrumentation with declarative match rules, static and dynamic predication, automatic state reporting, and user library support, while achieving high performance through compiler and engine optimizations. At the back end, Whamm provides instrumentation to a Wasm engine as Wasm code, reusing existing engine optimizations and unlocking new ones, most notably intrinsification, to minimize overhead. In particular, explicitly requesting program state in match rules, rather than reflection, enables the engine to efficiently bundle arguments and even inline compiled probe logic. Whamm streamlines the tooling effort, as its bytecode-rewriting target can run instrumented programs everywhere, lowering fragmentation and advancing the state of the art for engine support. We evaluate Whamm with case studies of non-trivial monitors and show it is expressive, powerful, and efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoP2C: An LLM-Based Agent Framework for Code Repository Generation from Multimodal Content in Academic Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20115v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML) research is spread through academic papers featuring rich multimodal content, including text, diagrams, and tabular results. However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

Sojourner under Sabotage, a browser-based serious game, reimagines this learning experience by blending education with an immersive and interactive storyline. Players take on the role of a spaceship crew member, using unit testing and debugging techniques to identify and repair sabotaged components across seven progressively challenging levels. A study with 79 students demonstrates that the game is a powerful tool for enhancing motivation, engagement, and skill development. These findings underscore the transformative potential of serious games in making essential software engineering practices accessible and enjoyable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse-Transpilation: Reverse-Engineering Quantum Compiler Optimization Passes from Circuit Snapshots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19113v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circuit compilation, a crucial process for adapting quantum algorithms to hardware constraints, often operates as a ``black box,'' with limited visibility into the optimization techniques used by proprietary systems or advanced open-source frameworks. Due to fundamental differences in qubit technologies, efficient compiler design is an expensive process, further exposing these systems to various security threats. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating one such challenge affecting compiler confidentiality, specifically, reverse-engineering compilation methodologies. We propose a simple ML-based framework to infer underlying optimization techniques by leveraging structural differences observed between original and compiled circuits. The motivation is twofold: (1) enhancing transparency in circuit optimization for improved cross-platform debugging and performance tuning, and (2) identifying potential intellectual property (IP)-protected optimizations employed by commercial systems. Our extensive evaluation across thousands of quantum circuits shows that a neural network performs the best in detecting optimization passes, with individual pass F1-scores reaching as high as 0.96. Thus, our initial study demonstrates the viability of this threat to compiler confidentiality and underscores the need for active research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriDebug: A Unified LLM for Verilog Debugging via Contrastive Embedding and Guided Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19099v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in debugging for various programming languages. However, the application of LLMs to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging. Unlike existing methods, VeriDebug employs an embedding-based technique to accurately retrieve internal information, followed by bug-fixing. VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves 64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo (36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of various large language models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA, GEMINI, and GPT-4o in interpreting such visual inputs. We employ prompt engineering techniques, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot learning, to assess each model's responsiveness and accuracy. Our findings show that while GPT-4o shows promising capabilities, achieving over 60% similarity to baseline questions for 51.75% of the tested images, challenges remain in obtaining consistent and accurate interpretations for more complex images. This research advances our understanding of the feasibility of using generative AI for image-centric problem-solving in developer communities, highlighting both the potential benefits and current limitations of this approach while envisioning a future where visual-based debugging copilot tools become a reality.</p></details> |  |

Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability, especially their error rates across domains and the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o). Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025. Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error distributions. Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50% with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%. Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over 50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates (~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability (10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability. Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from biological healing - where the human body detects damage, signals the brain, and activates targeted recovery - this paper explores the concept of self-healing software driven by artificial intelligence. We propose a novel framework that mimics this biological model system observability tools serve as sensory inputs, AI models function as the cognitive core for diagnosis and repair, and healing agents apply targeted code and test modifications. By combining log analysis, static code inspection, and AI-driven generation of patches or test updates, our approach aims to reduce downtime, accelerate debugging, and enhance software resilience. We evaluate the effectiveness of this model through case studies and simulations, comparing it against traditional manual debugging and recovery workflows. This work paves the way toward intelligent, adaptive and self-reliant software systems capable of continuous healing, akin to living organisms.</p></details> |  |

By introducing a complex search process during inference, type classes can lead to wholly inscrutable or useless errors. We describe a system, Argus, for interactively visualizing type class inferences to help programmers debug inference failures, applied specifically to Rust's trait system. The core insight of Argus is to avoid the traditional model of compiler diagnostics as one-size-fits-all, instead providing the programmer with different views on the search tree corresponding to different debugging goals. Argus carefully uses defaults to improve debugging productivity, including interface design (e.g., not showing full paths of types by default) and heuristics (e.g., sorting obligations based on the expected complexity of fixing them). We evaluated Argus in a user study where $N = 25$ participants debugged type inference failures in realistic Rust programs, finding that participants using Argus correctly localized $2.2\times$ as many faults and localized $3.3\times$ faster compared to not using Argus.</p></details> |  |

These missing links and data obstruct both developers and, more recently, large language models (LLMs) working with unfamiliar code. We present Codetations, a system that helps developers contextualize documents with rich notes and tools. Unlike previous approaches, notes in Codetations stay outside the document to prevent code clutter, attaching to spans in the document using a hybrid edit-tracking/LLM-based method. Their content is dynamic, interactive, and synchronized with code changes. A worked example shows that relevant notes with interactively-collected data improve LLM performance during code repair. In our user evaluation, developers praised these properties and saw significant potential in annotation types that we generated with an LLM in just a few minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design, where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix, we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct their software goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, FSE2025</p></details> |

However, diagnosing a CI regression is a tedious process that involves the manual analysis of lengthy build logs. In this paper, we explore how textual differencing can support the debugging of CI regressions. As off-the-shelf diff algorithms produce suboptimal results, in this work we introduce a new diff algorithm specifically tailored to build logs called CiDiff. We evaluate CiDiff against several baselines on a novel dataset of 17 906 CI regressions, performing an accuracy study, a quantitative study and a user-study. Notably, our algorithm reduces the number of lines to inspect by about 60 % in the median case, with reasonable overhead compared to the state-of-practice LCS-diff. Finally, our algorithm is preferred by the majority of participants in 70 % of the regression cases, whereas LCS-diff is preferred in only 5 % of the cases.</p></details> |  |

(2) Showcases modern features, including per-app address spaces, threading, commodity filesystems, USB, DMA, multicore, self-hosted debugging, and a window manager. (3) Supports rich applications such as 2D/3D games, music and video players, and a blockchain miner. Unlike traditional instructional systems, VOS emphasizes strong motivation for building systems-supporting engaging, media-rich apps that go beyond basic terminal programs. To achieve this, we design VOS to strike a careful balance between essential OS complexity and overall simplicity. Our method, which we call inverse engineering, breaks down a full-featured OS into a set of incremental, self-contained prototypes. Each prototype introduces a minimal set of OS mechanisms, driven by the needs of specific apps. The construction process (i.e., forward engineering) then progressively enables these apps by bringing up one mechanism at a time. VOS makes it accessible for a wider audience to experience building a software system that is self-contained and usable in everyday scenarios.</p></details> |  |

General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2025 AI4EDU Workshop</p></details> |
| **[OptimAI: Optimization from Natural Language Using LLM-Powered AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16918v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization plays a vital role in scientific research and practical applications, but formulating a concrete optimization problem described in natural language into a mathematical form and selecting a suitable solver to solve the problem requires substantial domain expertise. We introduce \textbf{OptimAI}, a framework for solving \underline{Optim}ization problems described in natural language by leveraging LLM-powered \underline{AI} agents, achieving superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is built upon four key roles: (1) a \emph{formulator} that translates natural language problem descriptions into precise mathematical formulations; (2) a \emph{planner} that constructs a high-level solution strategy prior to execution; and (3) a \emph{coder} and a \emph{code critic} capable of interacting with the environment and reflecting on outcomes to refine future actions. Ablation studies confirm that all roles are essential; removing the planner or code critic results in $5.8\times$ and $3.1\times$ drops in productivity, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce UCB-based debug scheduling to dynamically switch between alternative plans, yielding an additional $3.3\times$ productivity gain. Our design emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, allowing us to conveniently explore the synergistic effect of combining diverse models within a unified system. Our approach attains 88.1\% accuracy on the NLP4LP dataset and 71.2\% on the Optibench (non-linear w/o table) subset, reducing error rates by 58\% and 50\% respectively over prior best results.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v4)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, to appear at FSE 2025</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up industrial survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 17 images, 8 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, the lack of high-quality, scalable training datasets, especially those with verifiable outputs and intermediate reasoning traces-limits progress, particularly for open-source models. In this work, we present SWE-Synth, a framework for synthesizing realistic, verifiable, and process-aware bug-fix datasets at the repository level. SWE-Synth leverages LLM agents to simulate debugging workflows, producing not only bug-fix pairs but also test cases and structured repair trajectories. Compared to manually curated datasets, our method scales with minimal human effort while preserving contextual richness and correctness. Experiments show that models trained on SWE-Synth outperform those trained on real-world datasets by 2.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic, agent-generated data to advance the state of the art in APR and software engineering automation.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the complexity inherent to AI poses new challenges. Explainable AI (XAI) may allow developers to understand better the systems they build, which, in turn, can help with tasks like debugging. In this paper, we report insights from a series of surveys with software developers that highlight that there is indeed an increased need for explanatory tools to support developers in creating AI systems. However, the feedback also indicates that existing XAI systems still fall short of this aspiration. Thus, we see an unmet need to provide developers with adequate support mechanisms to cope with this complexity so they can embed AI into high-quality software in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Engineering Interactive Systems Embedding AI Technologies at EICS 2024, Tuesday June 25th, 2024 - Cagliary, Sardinia, Italy</p></details> |

Our method allows multiple quantum states to be observed at different points within a single circuit, one at a time, and saved into classical memory without destruction. These saved states can be accessed on demand by downstream applications, introducing a dynamic and programmable notion of quantum memory that supports modular, non-destructive quantum workflows. We propose a hardware-agnostic, machine learning-driven framework to capture non-destructive estimates, or "snapshots," of quantum states at arbitrary points within a circuit, enabling classical storage and later reconstruction, similar to memory operations in classical computing. This capability is essential for debugging, introspection, and persistent memory in quantum systems, yet remains difficult due to the no-cloning theorem and destructive measurements. Our guess-and-check approach uses fidelity estimation via the SWAP test to guide state reconstruction. We explore both gradient-based deep neural networks and gradient-free evolutionary strategies to estimate quantum states using only fidelity as the learning signal. We demonstrate a key component of our framework on IBM quantum hardware, achieving high-fidelity (approximately 1.0) reconstructions for Hadamard and other known states. In simulation, our models achieve an average fidelity of 0.999 across 100 random quantum states. This provides a pathway toward non-volatile quantum memory, enabling long-term storage and reuse of quantum information, and laying groundwork for future quantum memory architectures.</p></details> | 11 Pages, 8 figures |
| **[Flowco: Rethinking Data Analysis in the Age of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14038v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conducting data analysis typically involves authoring code to transform, visualize, analyze, and interpret data. Large language models (LLMs) are now capable of generating such code for simple, routine analyses. LLMs promise to democratize data science by enabling those with limited programming expertise to conduct data analyses, including in scientific research, business, and policymaking. However, analysts in many real-world settings must often exercise fine-grained control over specific analysis steps, verify intermediate results explicitly, and iteratively refine their analytical approaches. Such tasks present barriers to building robust and reproducible analyses using LLMs alone or even in conjunction with existing authoring tools (e.g., computational notebooks). This paper introduces Flowco, a new mixed-initiative system to address these challenges. Flowco leverages a visual dataflow programming model and integrates LLMs into every phase of the authoring process. A user study suggests that Flowco supports analysts, particularly those with less programming experience, in quickly authoring, debugging, and refining data analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG Without the Lag: Interactive Debugging for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13587v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines have become the de-facto approach for building AI assistants with access to external, domain-specific knowledge. Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R) relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses. Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles. To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY, insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12 engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with developers' natural workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools implement the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose ChaosEater, a system for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines the agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for Kubernetes systems, which are managed through code (i.e., Infrastructure as Code). Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater perform software engineering tasks to complete CE cycles, including requirement definition, code generation, debugging, and testing. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on both small and large Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it stably completes reasonable single CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. The CE cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>114 p...</summary><p>114 pages (7 main), 11 figures.

| **[Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15756v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p></details> |  |

In addition, it also serves as the cornerstone of the final sign-off, determining whether the chip is ready to be sent to the semiconductor foundry for fabrication. Recently, as the technology advance relentlessly, smaller metal pitches and the increasing number of devices have led to greater challenges and longer turn-around-time for experienced human designers to debug timing issues from the Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) timing reports. As a result, an efficient and intelligent methodology is highly necessary and essential for debugging timing issues and reduce the turnaround times. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise across various tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, incorporating reasoning and actions. In this work, we propose a timing analysis agent, that is empowered by multi-LLMs task solving, and incorporates a novel hierarchical planning and solving flow to automate the analysis of timing reports from commercial tool. In addition, we build a Timing Debug Relation Graph (TDRG) that connects the reports with the relationships of debug traces from experienced timing engineers. The timing analysis agent employs the novel Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, that includes agent and coding to retrieve data accurately, on the developed TDRG. In our studies, the proposed timing analysis agent achieves an average 98% pass-rate on a single-report benchmark and a 90% pass-rate for multi-report benchmark from industrial designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

These methods are increasingly involved in model debugging, performance optimization, and gaining insights into the workings of a model. With such critical applications of these methods, it is imperative to measure the uncertainty associated with the explanations generated by these methods. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to ascertain the explanation uncertainty of neural networks by combining uncertainty estimation methods and explanation methods. We use this pipeline to produce explanation distributions for the CIFAR-10, FER+, and California Housing datasets. By computing the coefficient of variation of these distributions, we evaluate the confidence in the explanation and determine that the explanations generated using Guided Backpropagation have low uncertainty associated with them. Additionally, we compute modified pixel insertion/deletion metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, UNCV @ CVPR 2025 Camera ready</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent That Debugs: Dynamic State-Guided Vulnerability Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07634v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, more vulnerabilities have been discovered every day, while manual vulnerability repair requires specialized knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, many detected or even published vulnerabilities remain unpatched, thereby increasing the exposure of software systems to attacks. Recent advancements in agents based on Large Language Models have demonstrated their increasing capabilities in code understanding and generation, which can be promising to achieve automated vulnerability repair. However, the effectiveness of agents based on static information retrieval is still not sufficient for patch generation. To address the challenge, we propose a program repair agent called VulDebugger that fully utilizes both static and dynamic context, and it debugs programs in a manner akin to humans. The agent inspects the actual state of the program via the debugger and infers expected states via constraints that need to be satisfied. By continuously comparing the actual state with the expected state, it deeply understands the root causes of the vulnerabilities and ultimately accomplishes repairs. We experimentally evaluated VulDebugger on 50 real-life projects. With 60.00% successfully fixed, VulDebugger significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for vulnerability repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Accurately Do Large Language Models Understand Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04372v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric. Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 600,010 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs. We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 78% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently Under Review.

Recent works demonstrate that various AI-assisted research methods can largely improve research efficiency by improving data analysis, accelerating computation, and fostering novel idea generation. To further move towards the ultimate goal (i.e., automatic scientific research), in this paper, we introduce Dolphin, a closed-loop LLM-driven framework to enhance the automation level of scientific research. Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on feedback from previous experiments and relevant papers ranked by the topic and task attributes. Then, the generated ideas can be implemented using a code template refined and debugged with the designed exception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automatically analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next round of idea generation. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of different topics and a subset of MLE-bench. Results show that Dolphin can continuously improve the performance of the input topic in a loop. We highlight that Dolphin can automatically propose methods that are comparable to the state-of-the-art in some tasks such as 3D point classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 12 figures, and our homepage: https://alpha-innovator.github.io/Dolphin-project-page</p></details> |

We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations to make code amenable to safe, accurate, and efficient graph execution. We present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in specifying whether their otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL code could be reliably and efficiently executed as graphs while preserving semantics. The approach, based on a novel imperative tensor analysis, automatically determines when it is safe and potentially advantageous to migrate imperative DL code to graph execution. The approach is implemented as a PyDev Eclipse IDE plug-in that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and evaluated on 19 Python projects consisting of 132.05 KLOC. We found that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Studying the Impact of Early Test Termination Due to Assertion Failure on Code Coverage and Spectrum-based Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04557v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An assertion is commonly used to validate the expected programs behavior (e.g., if the returned value of a method equals an expected value) in software testing. Although it is a recommended practice to use only one assertion in a single test to avoid code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette), it is common to have multiple assertions in a single test. One issue with tests that have multiple assertions is that when the test fails at an early assertion (not the last one), the test will terminate at that point, and the remaining testing code will not be executed. This, in turn, can potentially reduce the code coverage and the performance of techniques that rely on code coverage information (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization). We refer to such a scenario as early test termination. Understanding the impact of early test termination on test coverage is important for software testing and debugging, particularly for the techniques that rely on coverage information obtained from the testing. We conducted the first empirical study on early test termination due to assertion failure (i.e., early test termination) by investigating 207 versions of 6 open-source projects. We found that a nonnegligible portion of the failed tests (19.1%) is early terminated due to assertion failure. Our findings indicate that early test termination harms both code coverage and the effectiveness of spectrum-based fault localization. For instance, after eliminating early test termination, the line/branch coverage is improved in 55% of the studied versions, and improves the performance of two popular SBFL techniques Ochiai and Tarantula by 15.1% and 10.7% compared to the original setting (without eliminating early test termination) in terms of MFR, respectively.</p></details> |  |

A typical multi-agent framework consists of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that are responsible for task planning, code generation, testing, debugging, etc. Studies have shown that existing multi-agent code generation frameworks perform well on ChatGPT. However, their generalizability across other foundation LLMs remains unexplored systematically. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the generalizability of four state-of-the-art multi-agent code generation frameworks across six open-source LLMs with varying parameter sizes, architectures, and performance levels. Our study reveals the unstable generalizability of existing frameworks on diverse foundation LLMs. Based on the findings obtained from the empirical study, we propose AdaCoder, a novel adaptive planning, multi-agent framework for function-level code generation. AdaCoder has two phases. Phase-1 is an initial code generation step without planning, which uses an LLM-based coding agent and a script-based testing agent to unleash LLM's native power, identify cases beyond LLM's power, and determine the errors hindering execution. Phase-2 adds a rule-based debugging agent and an LLM-based planning agent for iterative code generation with planning. Our evaluation shows that AdaCoder achieves higher generalizability on diverse LLMs. Compared to the best baseline MapCoder, AdaCoder is on average 27.69% higher in Pass@1, 16 times faster in inference, and 12 times lower in token consumption.</p></details> |  |

However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset.

| **[Productively Deploying Emerging Models on Emerging Platforms: A Top-Down Approach for Testing and Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09151v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While existing machine learning (ML) frameworks focus on established platforms, like running CUDA on server-grade GPUs, there have been growing demands to enable emerging AI applications in a broader set of scenarios, such as running Large Language Models (LLMs) within browsers and mobile phones. However, deploying emerging models on new platforms (such as Metal and WebGPU) presents significant software engineering challenges due to rapid model evolution and limited tooling and practices for these platforms. Previous practice for ML model deployment often follows a bottom-up fashion, where engineers first implement individual required operators and then put them together. However, this traditional development approach fails to meet the productivity requirements when deploying emerging ML applications, with the testing and debugging part as a bottleneck. To this end, we introduce \textsc{TapML}, a top-down approach designed to streamline model deployment on diverse platforms. While the traditional bottom-up approach requires crafting manual tests, \textsc{TapML} automatically creates high-quality, realistic test data through operator-wise test carving. Furthermore, \textsc{TapML} uses a migration-based strategy to gradually offload model implementation from the mature source platform to the target platform, minimizing the debugging scope of compound errors. \textsc{TapML} has been used as the default development method in the MLC-LLM project to deploy emerging ML models. Within 2 years, \textsc{TapML} has accelerated the deployment of 105 emerging models in 27 model architectures across 5 emerging platforms. We show that \textsc{TapML} effectively boosts developer productivity while ensuring the quality of deployed models. Furthermore, we summarize comprehensive case studies from our real-world development, offering best practices for developing emerging ML systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartFL: Semantics Based Probabilistic Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23224v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing-based fault localization has been a research focus in software engineering in the past decades. It localizes faulty program elements based on a set of passing and failing test executions. Since whether a fault could be triggered and detected by a test is related to program semantics, it is crucial to model program semantics in fault localization approaches. Existing approaches either consider the full semantics of the program (e.g., mutation-based fault localization and angelic debugging), leading to scalability issues, or ignore the semantics of the program (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization), leading to imprecise localization results. Our key idea is: by modeling only the correctness of program values but not their full semantics, a balance could be reached between effectiveness and scalability. To realize this idea, we introduce a probabilistic model by efficient approximation of program semantics and several techniques to address scalability challenges. Our approach, SmartFL(SeMantics bAsed pRobabilisTic Fault Localization), is evaluated on a real-world dataset, Defects4J 2.0. The top-1 statement-level accuracy of our approach is {14\%}, which improves 130\% over the best SBFL and MBFL methods. The average time cost is {205} seconds per fault, which is half of SBFL methods. After combining our approach with existing approaches using the CombineFL framework, the performance of the combined approach is significantly boosted by an average of 10\% on top-1, top-3, and top-5 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art combination methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering Code: https://github.com/toledosakasa/SMARTFL This update corrects the author's name</p></details> |

However, current OOD detection methods often suffer from restrictive distributional assumptions, limited scalability, and a lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose STOOD-X, a two-stage methodology that combines a Statistical nonparametric Test for OOD Detection with eXplainability enhancements. In the first stage, STOOD-X uses feature-space distances and a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to identify OOD samples without assuming a specific feature distribution. In the second stage, it generates user-friendly, concept-based visual explanations that reveal the features driving each decision, aligning with the BLUE XAI paradigm. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and multiple architectures, STOOD-X achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art post hoc OOD detectors, particularly in high-dimensional and complex settings. In addition, its explainability framework enables human oversight, bias detection, and model debugging, fostering trust and collaboration between humans and AI systems. The STOOD-X methodology therefore offers a robust, explainable, and scalable solution for real-world OOD detection tasks.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 Figures |

This paper explores the capabilities and applications of Llama-driven code generation, highlighting its ability to translate natural language prompts into executable code across multiple programming languages. Key features include contextual awareness, multi-language support, and enhanced debugging and optimization functionalities. By examining these aspects, we illustrate how Llama can serve as a versatile tool for developers of all skill levels, improving productivity and efficiency in software development. The potential implications for education, industry, and the future of coding practices are also discussed, underscoring the transformative impact of AI in programming. Experimentation shows that while Llama 3.1 405B performs well with simple algorithmic and data structure based problems, it still struggles with problems on Quantum Computing, Bioinformatics, and Artificial Intelligence.</p></details> | updated version |
| **[Are Autonomous Web Agents Good Testers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01495v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in automated testing, manual testing remains prevalent due to the high maintenance demands associated with test script fragility-scripts often break with minor changes in application structure. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential alternative by powering Autonomous Web Agents (AWAs) that can autonomously interact with applications. These agents may serve as Autonomous Test Agents (ATAs), potentially reducing the need for maintenance-heavy automated scripts by utilising natural language instructions similar to those used by human testers. This paper investigates the feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and how to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web applications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and failing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and pinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps, verifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using our benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed to a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best performing implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation, SeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA implementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement). However, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a promising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be addressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for robust, low maintenance test automation.

| **[ScienceAgentBench: Toward Rigorous Assessment of Language Agents for Data-Driven Scientific Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05080v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancements of large language models (LLMs) have piqued growing interest in developing LLM-based language agents to automate scientific discovery end-to-end, which has sparked both excitement and skepticism about their true capabilities. In this work, we call for rigorous assessment of agents on individual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims on end-to-end automation. To this end, we present ScienceAgentBench, a new benchmark for evaluating language agents for data-driven scientific discovery. To ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our benchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four disciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify the target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and employ an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs, execution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual validation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation quality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies to mitigate data contamination concerns. Using ScienceAgentBench, we evaluate five open-weight and proprietary LLMs, each with three frameworks: direct prompting, OpenHands CodeAct, and self-debug. Given three attempts for each task, the best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently and 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge. In addition, we evaluate OpenAI o1-preview with direct prompting and self-debug, which can boost the performance to 42.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of increasing inference-time compute but with more than 10 times the cost of other LLMs. Still, our results underscore the limitations of current language agents in generating code for data-driven discovery, let alone end-to-end automation for scientific research.</p></details> | ICLR 2025. 60 pages |

However, deployment remains a critical challenge due to complex environment configurations, dependency conflicts, cross-platform adaptation, and debugging difficulties, which hinder automation and adoption. This paper introduces AI2Agent, an end-to-end framework that automates AI project deployment through guideline-driven execution, self-adaptive debugging, and case \& solution accumulation. AI2Agent dynamically analyzes deployment challenges, learns from past cases, and iteratively refines its approach, significantly reducing human intervention. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments on 30 AI deployment cases, covering TTS, text-to-image generation, image editing, and other AI applications. Results show that AI2Agent significantly reduces deployment time and improves success rates. The code and demo video are now publicly accessible.</p></details> |  |

We posit that LLMs can benefit from the ability to interactively explore a codebase to gather the information relevant to their task. To achieve this, we present a textual environment, namely debug-gym, for developing LLM-based agents in an interactive coding setting. Our environment is lightweight and provides a preset of useful tools, such as a Python debugger (pdb), designed to facilitate an LLM-based agent's interactive debugging. Beyond coding and debugging tasks, this approach can be generalized to other tasks that would benefit from information-seeking behavior by an LLM agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Code Translation in Repository Context via Triple Knowledge-Augmented](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18305v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have behaved well in function-level code translation without repository-level context. However, the performance of LLMs in repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex dependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans, which leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation quality under repository context in real-world software development. First, K-Trans constructs a translation knowledge base by extracting relevant information from target-language codebases, the repository being translated, and prior translation results. Second, for each function to be translated, K-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code samples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs, serving as references to enhance LLM for translation. Third, K-Trans constructs a knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge and employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository context. It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation correctness. The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline adapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and 0.138 in CodeBLEU. It is important to note that the results also demonstrate that each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in handling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage examples making the most notable contribution. Moreover, as the self-evolution process progresses, the knowledge base continuously enhances the LLM's performance across various aspects of the repository-level code translation.</p></details> |  |

Given the English description of a programming problem and a set of unit tests, the model's goal is to synthesize the correct program that solves the problem and passes the tests. QualityFlow includes large language model (LLM) agents resembling a software development team, including code generation, testing, and self-debugging. We propose the LLM Quality Checker, which explicitly "imagines" whether the synthesized programs' execution would conform to the unit tests. The Quality Checks dynamically control the workflow, including actions to submit the final answer, clarify the problem statement, and revert previous workflow steps. Our experiments show that the Quality Checker can precisely accept any correct program, mitigate faulty synthesized tests, and prevent potential workflow deviation. QualityFlow establishes the state-of-the-art results on four program synthesis benchmarks: MBPP, HumanEval, and stricter evaluations from MBPP-EvalPlus and HumanEval-EvalPlus.</p></details> |  |

This study examined individual attention heads in vision transformers (ViTs) fine tuned on distorted 2D spectrogram images containing non relevant content (axis labels, titles, color bars). By introducing extraneous features, the study analyzed how transformer components processed unrelated information, using mechanistic interpretability to debug issues and reveal insights into transformer architectures. Attention maps assessed head contributions across layers. Heads in early layers (1 to 3) showed minimal task impact with ablation increased MSE loss slightly ({\mu}=0.11%, {\sigma}=0.09%), indicating focus on less critical low level features. In contrast, deeper heads (e.g., layer 6) caused a threefold higher loss increase ({\mu}=0.34%, {\sigma}=0.02%), demonstrating greater task importance. Intermediate layers (6 to 11) exhibited monosemantic behavior, attending exclusively to chirp regions. Some early heads (1 to 4) were monosemantic but non task relevant (e.g. text detectors, edge or corner detectors). Attention maps distinguished monosemantic heads (precise chirp localization) from polysemantic heads (multiple irrelevant regions). These findings revealed functional specialization in ViTs, showing how heads processed relevant vs. extraneous information. By decomposing transformers into interpretable components, this work enhanced model understanding, identified vulnerabilities, and advanced safer, more transparent AI.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

In this paper, we explore multi-modal Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to automatically interpret the opaque representation space of vision models using natural language. This in turn, enables a semantic analysis of model behavior using human-understandable concepts, without requiring costly human annotations. Key to our approach is the notion of semantic heatmap, that succinctly captures the statistical properties of DNNs in terms of the concepts discovered with the VLM and that are computed off-line using a held-out data set. We show the utility of semantic heatmaps for fault localization -- an essential step in debugging -- in vision models. Our proposed technique helps localize the fault in the network (encoder vs head) and also highlights the responsible high-level concepts, by leveraging novel differential heatmaps, which summarize the semantic differences between the correct and incorrect behaviour of the analyzed DNN. We further propose a lightweight runtime analysis to detect and filter-out defects at runtime, thus improving the reliability of the analyzed DNNs. The runtime analysis works by measuring and comparing the similarity between the heatmap computed for a new (unseen) input and the heatmaps computed a-priori for correct vs incorrect DNN behavior. We consider two types of defects: misclassifications and vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate the debugging and runtime analysis on a case study involving a complex ResNet-based classifier trained on the RIVAL10 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>CAIN ...</summary><p>CAIN 2025 (4th International Conference on AI Engineering -- Software Engineering for AI)</p></details> |

While cross-attention has been well-studied in text-to-image tasks, their interpretability in image-to-image (I2I) diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces Image-to-Image Attribution Maps (I2AM), a method that enhances the interpretability of I2I models by visualizing bidirectional attribution maps, from the reference image to the generated image and vice versa. I2AM aggregates cross-attention scores across time steps, attention heads, and layers, offering insights into how critical features are transferred between images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of I2AM across object detection, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our results demonstrate that I2AM successfully identifies key regions responsible for generating the output, even in complex scenes. Additionally, we introduce the Inpainting Mask Attention Consistency Score (IMACS) as a novel evaluation metric to assess the alignment between attribution maps and inpainting masks, which correlates strongly with existing performance metrics. Through extensive experiments, we show that I2AM enables model debugging and refinement, providing practical tools for improving I2I model's performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Unveiling Pitfalls: Understanding Why AI-driven Code Agents Fail at GitHub Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p></details> |  |

In software engineering, LLM-powered coding agents have garnered significant attention due to their potential to automate complex development tasks, assist in debugging, and enhance productivity. However, existing approaches often struggle with sub-optimal decision-making, requiring either extensive manual intervention or inefficient compute scaling strategies. To improve coding agent performance, we present Dynamic Action Re-Sampling (DARS), a novel inference time compute scaling approach for coding agents, that is faster and more effective at recovering from sub-optimal decisions compared to baselines. While traditional agents either follow linear trajectories or rely on random sampling for scaling compute, our approach DARS works by branching out a trajectory at certain key decision points by taking an alternative action given the history of the trajectory and execution feedback of the previous attempt from that point. We evaluate our approach on SWE-Bench Lite benchmark, demonstrating that this scaling strategy achieves a pass@k score of 55% with Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2. Our framework achieves a pass@1 rate of 47%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCCoder: Streamlining Motion Control with LLM-Assisted Code Generation and Rigorous Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15154v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code generation. However, in the factory automation sector, particularly motion control, manual programming, alongside inefficient and unsafe debugging practices, remains prevalent. This stems from the complex interplay of mechanical and electrical systems and stringent safety requirements. Moreover, most current AI-assisted motion control programming efforts focus on PLCs, with little attention given to high-level languages and function libraries. To address these challenges, we introduce MCCoder, an LLM-powered system tailored for generating motion control code, integrated with a soft-motion controller. MCCoder improves code generation through a structured workflow that combines multitask decomposition, hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and iterative self-correction, utilizing a well-established motion library. Additionally, it integrates a 3D simulator for intuitive motion validation and logs of full motion trajectories for data verification, significantly enhancing accuracy and safety. In the absence of benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for evaluating motion control code generation, we propose MCEVAL, a dataset spanning motion tasks of varying complexity. Experiments show that MCCoder outperforms baseline models using Advanced RAG, achieving an overall performance gain of 33.09% and a 131.77% improvement on complex tasks in the MCEVAL dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[KernelGPT: Enhanced Kernel Fuzzing via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00563v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs in operating system kernels can affect billions of devices and users all over the world. As a result, a large body of research has been focused on kernel fuzzing, i.e., automatically generating syscall (system call) sequences to detect potential kernel bugs or vulnerabilities. Kernel fuzzing aims to generate valid syscall sequences guided by syscall specifications that define both the syntax and semantics of syscalls. While there has been existing work trying to automate syscall specification generation, this remains largely manual work, and a large number of important syscalls are still uncovered. In this paper, we propose KernelGPT, the first approach to automatically synthesizing syscall specifications via Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced kernel fuzzing. Our key insight is that LLMs have seen massive kernel code, documentation, and use cases during pre-training, and thus can automatically distill the necessary information for making valid syscalls. More specifically, KernelGPT leverages an iterative approach to automatically infer the specifications, and further debug and repair them based on the validation feedback. Our results demonstrate that KernelGPT can generate more new and valid specifications and achieve higher coverage than state-of-the-art techniques. So far, by using newly generated specifications, KernelGPT has already detected 24 new unique bugs in Linux kernel, with 12 fixed and 11 assigned with CVE numbers. Moreover, a number of specifications generated by KernelGPT have already been merged into the kernel fuzzer Syzkaller, following the request from its development team.</p></details> | ASPLOS 2025 |
| **[Mutation Testing via Iterative Large Language Model-Driven Scientific Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08182v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible test code. Intuitively they generate this by imitating tests seen in their training data, rather than reasoning about execution semantics. However, such reasoning is important when applying mutation testing, where individual tests need to demonstrate differences in program behavior between a program and specific artificial defects (mutants). In this paper, we evaluate whether Scientific Debugging, which has been shown to help LLMs when debugging, can also help them to generate tests for mutants. In the resulting approach, LLMs form hypotheses about how to kill specific mutants, and then iteratively generate and refine tests until they succeed, all with detailed explanations for each step. We compare this method to three baselines: (1) directly asking the LLM to generate tests, (2) repeatedly querying the LLM when tests fail, and (3) search-based test generation with Pynguin. Our experiments evaluate these methods based on several factors, including mutation score, code coverage, success rate, and the ability to identify equivalent mutants. The results demonstrate that LLMs, although requiring higher computation cost, consistently outperform Pynguin in generating tests with better fault detection and coverage. Importantly, we observe that the iterative refinement of test cases is important for achieving high-quality test suites.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Bug Reproduction for Effective Automated Program Repair at Google](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01821v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reports often lack sufficient detail for developers to reproduce and fix the underlying defects. Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs), tests that fail when the bug is present and pass when it has been resolved, are crucial for debugging, but they are rarely included in bug reports, both in open-source and in industrial settings. Thus, automatically generating BRTs from bug reports has the potential to accelerate the debugging process and lower time to repair. This paper investigates automated BRT generation within an industry setting, specifically at Google, focusing on the challenges of a large-scale, proprietary codebase and considering real-world industry bugs extracted from Google's internal issue tracker. We adapt and evaluate a state-of-the-art BRT generation technique, LIBRO, and present our agent-based approach, BRT Agent, which makes use of a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for code editing. Our BRT Agent significantly outperforms LIBRO, achieving a 28% plausible BRT generation rate, compared to 10% by LIBRO, on 80 human-reported bugs from Google's internal issue tracker. We further investigate the practical value of generated BRTs by integrating them with an Automated Program Repair (APR) system at Google. Our results show that providing BRTs to the APR system results in 30% more bugs with plausible fixes. Additionally, we introduce Ensemble Pass Rate (EPR), a metric which leverages the generated BRTs to select the most promising fixes from all fixes generated by APR system. Our evaluation on EPR for Top-K and threshold-based fix selections demonstrates promising results and trade-offs. For example, EPR correctly selects a plausible fix from a pool of 20 candidates in 70% of cases, based on its top-1 ranking.</p></details> |  |
| **[IterPref: Focal Preference Learning for Code Generation via Iterative Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02783v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference learning enhances Code LLMs beyond supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. Existing methods construct preference pairs from candidates based on test case success, treating the higher pass rate sample as positive and the lower as negative. However, this approach does not pinpoint specific errors in the code, which prevents the model from learning more informative error correction patterns, as aligning failing code as a whole lacks the granularity needed to capture meaningful error-resolution relationships. To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with IterPref achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that IterPref yields fewer errors. Our code and data will be made publicaly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and data will be released soon</p></details> |
| **[Fully Autonomous Programming using Iterative Multi-Agent Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07693v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) suffers from a "near-miss syndrome": the generated code closely resembles a correct solution but fails unit tests due to minor errors. We address this with a multi-agent framework called Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, and Repair (SEIDR). Effectively applying SEIDR to instruction-tuned LLMs requires determining (a) optimal prompts for LLMs, (b) what ranking algorithm selects the best programs in debugging rounds, and (c) balancing the repair of unsuccessful programs with the generation of new ones. We empirically explore these trade-offs by comparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies. We also evaluate lexicase and tournament selection to rank candidates in each generation. On Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 (PSB2), our framework outperforms both conventional use of OpenAI Codex without a repair phase and traditional genetic programming approaches. SEIDR outperforms the use of an LLM alone, solving 18 problems in C++ and 20 in Python on PSB2 at least once across experiments. To assess generalizability, we employ GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 on the PSB2 and HumanEval-X benchmarks. Although SEIDR with these models does not surpass current state-of-the-art methods on the Python benchmarks, the results on HumanEval-C++ are promising. SEIDR with Llama 3-8B achieves an average pass@100 of 84.2%. Across all SEIDR runs, 163 of 164 problems are solved at least once with GPT-3.5 in HumanEval-C++, and 162 of 164 with the smaller Llama 3-8B. We conclude that SEIDR effectively overcomes the near-miss syndrome in program synthesis with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM Trans. Evol.

Existing LLM-based approaches largely concentrate on isolated phases, neglecting the interdependent nature of many data science tasks and limiting their capacity for comprehensive end-to-end support. We propose DatawiseAgent, a notebook-centric LLM agent framework that unifies interactions among user, agent and the computational environment through markdown and executable code cells, supporting flexible and adaptive automated data science. Built on a Finite State Transducer(FST), DatawiseAgent orchestrates four stages, including DSF-like planning, incremental execution, self-debugging, and post-filtering. Specifically, the DFS-like planning stage systematically explores the solution space, while incremental execution harnesses real-time feedback and accommodates LLM's limited capabilities to progressively complete tasks. The self-debugging and post-filtering modules further enhance reliability by diagnosing and correcting errors and pruning extraneous information. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including data analysis, visualization, and data modeling, show that DatawiseAgent consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods across multiple model settings. These results highlight its potential to generalize across data science scenarios and lay the groundwork for more efficient, fully automated workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, most research focuses on generating correct patches while ignoring the consistency between the fixed code and the original buggy code. How to conduct adaptive bug fixing and generate patches with minimal modifications have seldom been investigated. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a novel task, namely AdaPR (Adaptive Program Repair). We then propose a two-stage approach AdaPatcher (Adaptive Patch Generator) to enhance program repair while maintaining the consistency. In the first stage, we utilize a Bug Locator with self-debug learning to accurately pinpoint bug locations. In the second stage, we train a Program Modifier to ensure consistency between the post-modified fixed code and the pre-modified buggy code. The Program Modifier is enhanced with a location-aware repair learning strategy to generate patches based on identified buggy lines, a hybrid training strategy for selective reference and an adaptive preference learning to prioritize fewer changes. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our two-stage framework for the newly proposed AdaPR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI2025 Oral</p></details> |

Explanations with recommender systems are useful for developers while debugging anomalies within the system and for consumers while interpreting the model's effectiveness in capturing their true preferences towards items. However, most of the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) explainable recommenders could not retain their explanation capability under noisy circumstances and moreover are not generalizable across different datasets. The robustness of the explanations must be ensured so that certain malicious attackers do not manipulate any high-stake decision scenarios to their advantage, which could cause severe consequences affecting large groups of interest. In this work, we present a general framework for feature-aware explainable recommenders that can withstand external attacks and provide robust and generalized explanations. This paper presents a novel framework which could be utilized as an additional defense tool, preserving the global explainability when subject to model-based white box attacks. Our framework is simple to implement and supports different methods regardless of the internal model structure and intrinsic utility within any model. We experimented our framework on two architecturally different feature-based SOTA explainable algorithms by training them on three popular e-commerce datasets of increasing scales. We noticed that both the algorithms displayed an overall improvement in the quality and robustness of the global explainability under normal as well as noisy environments across all the datasets, indicating the flexibility and mutability of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not i...</summary><p>Not in the final state</p></details> |
| **[PromptPex: Automatic Test Generation for Language Model Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05070v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being used in many applications and prompts for these models are integrated into software applications as code-like artifacts. These prompts behave much like traditional software in that they take inputs, generate outputs, and perform some specific function. However, prompts differ from traditional code in many ways and require new approaches to ensure that they are robust. For example, unlike traditional software the output of a prompt depends on the AI model that interprets it. Also, while natural language prompts are easy to modify, the impact of updates is harder to predict. New approaches to testing, debugging, and modifying prompts with respect to the model running them are required. To address some of these issues, we developed PromptPex, an LLM-based tool to automatically generate and evaluate unit tests for a given prompt. PromptPex extracts input and output specifications from a prompt and uses them to generate diverse, targeted, and valid unit tests. These tests are instrumental in identifying regressions when a prompt is changed and also serve as a tool to understand how prompts are interpreted by different models. We use PromptPex to generate tests for eight benchmark prompts and evaluate the quality of the generated tests by seeing if they can cause each of four diverse models to produce invalid output. PromptPex consistently creates tests that result in more invalid model outputs than a carefully constructed baseline LLM-based test generator. Furthermore, by extracting concrete specifications from the input prompt, PromptPex allows prompt writers to clearly understand and test specific aspects of their prompts. The source code of PromptPex is available at https://github.com/microsoft/promptpex.</p></details> |  |

Despite their growing adoption, there is a notable lack of formal, qualitative assessments of how LLMs are applied in real-world software development contexts. To fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with sixteen early-adopter professional developers to explore their use of LLMs throughout various stages of the software development life cycle. Our investigation examines four dimensions: people - how LLMs affect individual developers and teams; process - how LLMs alter software engineering workflows; product - LLM impact on software quality and innovation; and society - the broader socioeconomic and ethical implications of LLM adoption. Thematic analysis of our data reveals that while LLMs have not fundamentally revolutionized the development process, they have substantially enhanced routine coding tasks, including code generation, refactoring, and debugging. Developers reported the most effective outcomes when providing LLMs with clear, well-defined problem statements, indicating that LLMs excel with decomposed problems and specific requirements. Furthermore, these early-adopters identified that LLMs offer significant value for personal and professional development, aiding in learning new languages and concepts. Early-adopters, highly skilled in software engineering and how LLMs work, identified early and persisting challenges for software engineering, such as inaccuracies in generated content and the need for careful manual review before integrating LLM outputs into production environments. Our study provides a nuanced understanding of how LLMs are shaping the landscape of software development, with their benefits, limitations, and ongoing implications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Memorization: Evaluating the True Type Inference Capabilities of LLMs for Java Code Snippets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04076v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often found on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type information such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries. Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code snippets, showing promising results. However, these results are potentially affected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public on GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023). Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs' strong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere retrieval of ground truth from training data. To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code snippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. First, utilizing Thalia, a program synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for type inference evaluation. On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped significantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall. Second, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly degraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in understanding code semantics. Third, we used delta debugging to identify the minimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference. While type inference primarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly infer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a reliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the snippets. Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from data leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code snippets. Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed benchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs for type inference tasks.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models (FMs) play an increasingly prominent role in complex software systems, such as agentic software, they introduce significant observability and debuggability challenges. Although recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate their thought processes as part of the output, in many scenarios fast-thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) are still preferred due to latency constraints. LLM-powered agents operate autonomously with opaque implicit reasoning, making it difficult to debug their unexpected behaviors or errors. In this paper, we introduce Watson, a novel framework that provides reasoning observability into the implicit reasoning processes of agents driven by fast-thinking LLMs, allowing the identification and localization of errors and guidance for corrections. We demonstrate the accuracy of the recovered implicit reasoning trace by Watson and its usefulness through debugging and improving the performance of LLM-powered agents in two scenarios: Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark and SWE-bench-lite. Using Watson, we were able to observe and identify the implicit reasoning errors, and automatically provide targeted corrections at runtime that improve the Pass@1 of agents on MMLU and SWE-bench-lite by 7.58 (13.45% relative improvement) and 7.76 (12.31% relative improvement) percentage points, respectively, without updates to models or the cognitive architecture of the agents.</p></details> |  |

Unobtrusively capturing developers' cognitive load while working on different programming tasks could help optimize developers' work experience, increase their productivity, and positively impact code quality. In this paper, we propose a study in which the IntelliJ-based IDE plugin CognitIDE is used to collect, map, and visualize software developers' physiological activity data while they are working on various software development tasks. In a feasibility study, participants completed four simulated everyday working tasks of software developers - coding, debugging, code documentation, and email writing - based on Java open source code in the IDE whilst their physiological activity was recorded. Between the tasks, the participants' perceived workload was assessed. Feasibility testing showed that CognitIDE could successfully be used for data collection sessions of one hour, which was the most extended duration tested and was well-perceived by those working with it. Furthermore, the recorded physiological activity indicated higher cognitive load during working tasks compared to baseline recordings. This suggests that cognitive load can be assessed, mapped to code positions, visualized, and discussed with participants in such study setups with CognitIDE. These promising results indicate the usefulness of the plugin for diverse study workflows in a natural IDE environment.</p></details> |  |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.</p></details> |  |

Verilog is a popular hardware description language for designing and modeling digital systems; thus, Verilog generation is one of the emerging areas of research to facilitate the design process. In this work, we propose VerilogCoder, a system of multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Verilog code generation, to autonomously write Verilog code and fix syntax and functional errors using collaborative Verilog tools (i.e., syntax checker, simulator, and waveform tracer). Firstly, we propose a task planner that utilizes a novel Task and Circuit Relation Graph retrieval method to construct a holistic plan based on module descriptions. To debug and fix functional errors, we develop a novel and efficient abstract syntax tree (AST)-based waveform tracing tool, which is integrated within the autonomous Verilog completion flow. The proposed methodology successfully generates 94.2% syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by 33.9% on the VerilogEval-Human v2 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper 7 pages, reference 1 page, it is the version that accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Various methods have been proposed for testing, diagnosing, and repairing ML systems. However, the big picture informing important research directions that really address the dire needs of developers is yet to unfold, leaving several key questions unaddressed: (1) What faults have been targeted in the ML debugging research that fulfill developers needs in practice? (2) How are these faults addressed? (3) What are the challenges in addressing the yet untargeted faults? In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of debugging techniques for machine learning systems. We first collect technical papers focusing on debugging components in machine learning software. We then map these papers to a taxonomy of faults to assess the current state of fault resolution identified in existing literature. Subsequently, we analyze which techniques are used to address specific faults based on the collected papers. This results in a comprehensive taxonomy that aligns faults with their corresponding debugging methods. Finally, we examine previously released transcripts of interviewing developers to identify the challenges in resolving unfixed faults. Our analysis reveals that only 48 percent of the identified ML debugging challenges have been explicitly addressed by researchers, while 46.9 percent remain unresolved or unmentioned. In real world applications, we found that 52.6 percent of issues reported on GitHub and 70.3% of problems discussed in interviews are still unaddressed by research in ML debugging. The study identifies 13 primary challenges in ML debugging, highlighting a significant gap between the identification of ML debugging issues and their resolution in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatically Improving LLM-based Verilog Generation using EDA Tool Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11856v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, digital hardware designs are written in the Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and debugged manually by engineers. This can be time-consuming and error-prone for complex designs. Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a potential tool to help generate fully functioning HDL code, but most works have focused on generation in the single-shot capacity: i.e., run and evaluate, a process that does not leverage debugging and, as such, does not adequately reflect a realistic development process. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to leverage feedback from electronic design automation (EDA) tools to fix mistakes in their own generated Verilog. To accomplish this, we present an open-source, highly customizable framework, AutoChip, which combines conversational LLMs with the output from Verilog compilers and simulations to iteratively generate and repair Verilog. To determine the success of these LLMs we leverage the VerilogEval benchmark set. We evaluate four state-of-the-art conversational LLMs, focusing on readily accessible commercial models. EDA tool feedback proved to be consistently more effective than zero-shot prompting only with GPT-4o, the most computationally complex model we evaluated. In the best case, we observed a 5.8% increase in the number of successful designs with a 34.2% decrease in cost over the best zero-shot results. Mixing smaller models with this larger model at the end of the feedback iterations resulted in equally as much success as with GPT-4o using feedback, but incurred 41.9% lower cost (corresponding to an overall decrease in cost over zero-shot by 89.6%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in TODAES Special Issue on Large Language Models for Electronic System Design Automation</p></details> |

NSCT follows a Model-Based Testing (MBT) approach. These approaches usually struggle to test and represent time-varying network properties. NSCT also aims to achieve more accurate and reproducible protocol testing. It is implemented using the Ivy tool and the Shadow network simulator. This enables online debugging of real protocol implementations. A case study on an implementation of QUIC (picoquic) is presented, revealing an error in its compliance with a time-varying specification. This error has subsequently been rectified, highlighting NSCT's effectiveness in uncovering and addressing real-world protocol implementation issues. The article underscores NSCT's potential in advancing protocol testing methodologies, offering a notable contribution to the field of network protocol verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Promptware Engineering: Software Engineering for LLM Prompt Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02400v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software applications, with prompts serving as the primary 'programming' interface to guide their behavior. As a result, a new software paradigm, promptware, has emerged, using natural language prompts to interact with LLMs and enabling complex tasks without traditional coding. Unlike traditional software, which relies on formal programming languages and deterministic runtime environments, promptware is based on ambiguous, unstructured, and context-dependent natural language and operates on LLMs as runtime environments, which are probabilistic and non-deterministic. These fundamental differences introduce unique challenges in prompt development. In practice, prompt development is largely ad hoc and experimental, relying on a time-consuming trial-and-error process - a challenge we term the 'promptware crisis.' To address this, we propose promptware engineering, a new methodology that adapts established software engineering principles to the process of prompt development. Building on decades of success in traditional software engineering, we envision a systematic framework that includes prompt requirements engineering, design, implementation, testing, debugging, and evolution. Unlike traditional software engineering, our framework is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of prompt development. This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap for promptware engineering, identifying key research directions and offering actionable insights to advance LLM-based software development.</p></details> |  |

LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods.

Eliminating these UBs requires a deep understanding of Rust's safety rules and strong typing. Traditional methods require depth analysis of code, which is laborious and depends on knowledge design. The powerful semantic understanding capabilities of LLM offer new opportunities to solve this problem. Although existing large model debugging frameworks excel in semantic tasks, limited by fixed processes and lack adaptive and dynamic adjustment capabilities. Inspired by the dual process theory of decision-making (Fast and Slow Thinking), we present a LLM-based framework called RustBrain that automatically and flexibly minimizes UBs in Rust projects. Fast thinking extracts features to generate solutions, while slow thinking decomposes, verifies, and generalizes them abstractly. To apply verification and generalization results to solution generation, enabling dynamic adjustments and precise outputs, RustBrain integrates two thinking through a feedback mechanism. Experimental results on Miri dataset show a 94.3% pass rate and 80.4% execution rate, improving flexibility and Rust projects safety.</p></details> |  |

What challenges do developers face when trying to build and debug these AI agent teams? In formative interviews with five AI agent developers, we identify core challenges: difficulty reviewing long agent conversations to localize errors, lack of support in current tools for interactive debugging, and the need for tool support to iterate on agent configuration. Based on these needs, we developed an interactive multi-agent debugging tool, AGDebugger, with a UI for browsing and sending messages, the ability to edit and reset prior agent messages, and an overview visualization for navigating complex message histories. In a two-part user study with 14 participants, we identify common user strategies for steering agents and highlight the importance of interactive message resets for debugging. Our studies deepen understanding of interfaces for debugging increasingly important agentic workflows.</p></details> | Published at CHI 25 |

Shortcuts are non-relevant patterns in data, such as the background color or color intensity. So, to ensure the robustness of deep learning applications, there is a need for methods to detect and remove such shortcuts. Today's model debugging methods are time consuming since they often require customization to fit for a given model architecture in a specific domain. We propose a generalized, model-agnostic framework to debug deep learning models. We focus on the domain of histopathology, which has very large images that require large models - and therefore large computation resources. It can be run on a workstation with a commodity GPU. We demonstrate that our framework can replicate non-image shortcuts that have been found in previous work for self-supervised learning models, and we also identify possible shortcuts in a foundation model. Our easy to use tests contribute to the development of more reliable, accurate, and generalizable models for WSI analysis. Our framework is available as an open-source tool available on github.</p></details> |  |

Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce HiBug2, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. HiBug2 first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, HiBug2 extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that HiBug2 not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Interactive-Guided Differential Testing Approach for FPGA Simulation Debugger Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01138v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) development tool chains are widely used in FPGA design, simulation, and verification in critical areas like communications, automotive electronics, and aerospace. Commercial FPGA tool chains such as Xilinx' Vivado aids developers in swiftly identifying and rectifying bugs and issues in FPGA designs through a robust built-in debugger, ensuring the correctness and development efficiency of the FPGA design. Hardening such FPGA chip debugger tools by testing is crucial since engineers might misinterpret code and introduce incorrect fixes, leading to security risks. However, FPGA chip debugger tools are challenging to test as they require assessing both RTL designs and a series of debugging actions, including setting breakpoints and stepping through the code. To address this issue, we propose a interactive differential testing approach called DB-Hunter to detect bugs in Vivado's FPGA chip debugger tools. Specifically, DB-Hunter consists of three components: RTL design transformation component, debug action transformation component, and interactive differential testing component. By performing RTL design and debug action transformations, DB-Hunter generates diverse and complex RTL designs and debug actions, to thoroughly test the Vivado debugger using interactive differential testing to detect bugs. In three months, DB-Hunter reported 18 issues, including 10 confirmed as bugs by Xilinx Support, 6 bugs had been fixed in last version.</p></details> |  |

In computer vision, prototypical part models (ProtoPNets) have become the dominant model type to meet this need. Users can easily identify flaws in ProtoPNets, but fixing problems in a ProtoPNet requires slow, difficult retraining that is not guaranteed to resolve the issue. This problem is called the "interaction bottleneck." We solve the interaction bottleneck for ProtoPNets by simultaneously finding many equally good ProtoPNets (i.e., a draw from a "Rashomon set"). We show that our framework - called Proto-RSet - quickly produces many accurate, diverse ProtoPNets, allowing users to correct problems in real time while maintaining performance guarantees with respect to the training set. We demonstrate the utility of this method in two settings: 1) removing synthetic bias introduced to a bird identification model and 2) debugging a skin cancer identification model. This tool empowers non-machine-learning experts, such as clinicians or domain experts, to quickly refine and correct machine learning models without repeated retraining by machine learning experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Despite this, developers still need to manually inspect each patch to confirm its correctness, which is tedious and time-consuming. This challenge is exacerbated in the presence of plausible patches, which accidentally pass test cases but may not correctly fix the bug. To address this challenge, we propose an interactive approach called iFix to facilitate patch understanding and comparison based on their runtime difference. iFix performs static analysis to identify runtime variables related to the buggy statement and captures their runtime values during execution for each patch. These values are then aligned across different patch candidates, allowing users to compare and contrast their runtime behavior. To evaluate iFix, we conducted a within-subjects user study with 28 participants. Compared with manual inspection and a state-of-the-art interactive patch filtering technique, iFix reduced participants' task completion time by 36% and 33% while also improving their confidence by 50% and 20%, respectively. Besides, quantitative experiments demonstrate that iFix improves the ranking of correct patches by at least 39% compared with other patch ranking methods and is generalizable to different APR tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

| **[LiTransProQA: an LLM-based Literary Translation evaluation metric with Professional Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05423v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LiTransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. LiTransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LiTransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments.

| **[Novel Deep Neural OFDM Receiver Architectures for LLR Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20500v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural receivers have recently become a popular topic, where the received signals can be directly decoded by data driven mechanisms such as machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Differential Testing With LLMs For Testing Deep Learning Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07944v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by ACM TOSEM.

Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

| **[T-T: Table Transformer for Tagging-based Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05271v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences. The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges: overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Attention-Based Model for 5G Radio-based Outdoor Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23810v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio-based localization in dynamic environments, such as urban and vehicular settings, requires systems that efficiently adapt to varying signal conditions and environmental changes. Factors like multipath interference and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations, which also results in reduced execution time and smaller model size. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a single-layer perceptron. This enables seamless transitions between specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing accuracy and computational complexity. We design three low-complex models tailored for distinct scenarios, and a router that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station and compared to more general models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

For this type of curve data sets, the present paper solves the problem of local linear approximation of the Fr\'echet conditional mean in an extrinsic and intrinsic way. The extrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression predictor is obtained in the time varying tangent space by projection into an orthornormal basis of the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\'echet mean approach is adopted in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is also proved. The performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and intrinsic functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\'echet curve predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. The finite-sample size properties are also tested in a real-data application via cross-validation. Specifically, functional prediction of the magnetic vector field from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft is addressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding In-context Learning of Addition via Activation Subspaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05145v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.</p></details> | 16 pages |

The spectrum of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal, locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries. Our system is the first of its kind to be deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as MAVs, leveraging vision-language information for real-world robotic tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

The dataset encodes 37,710 pairwise comparisons across 13,462 images, structured along six criteria - Accessibility, Safety, Comfort, Invitingness, Inclusivity, and Diversity - derived from 634 community-defined concepts. Using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL to reflect multi-criteria spatial preferences and evaluate the LIVS dataset and the fine-tuned model through four case studies: (1) DPO increases alignment with annotated preferences, particularly when annotation volume is high; (2) preference patterns vary across participant identities, underscoring the need for intersectional data; (3) human-authored prompts generate more distinctive visual outputs than LLM-generated ones, influencing annotation decisiveness; and (4) intersectional groups assign systematically different ratings across criteria, revealing the limitations of single-objective alignment. While DPO improves alignment under specific conditions, the prevalence of neutral ratings indicates that community values are heterogeneous and often ambiguous. LIVS provides a benchmark for developing T2I models that incorporate local, stakeholder-driven preferences, offering a foundation for context-aware alignment in spatial design.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[FedRE: Robust and Effective Federated Learning with Privacy Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04889v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Federated Learning (FL) employing gradient aggregation at the server for distributed training to prevent the privacy leakage of raw data, private information can still be divulged through the analysis of uploaded gradients from clients. Substantial efforts have been made to integrate local differential privacy (LDP) into the system to achieve a strict privacy guarantee. However, existing methods fail to take practical issues into account by merely perturbing each sample with the same mechanism while each client may have their own privacy preferences on privacy-sensitive information (PSI), which is not uniformly distributed across the raw data. In such a case, excessive privacy protection from private-insensitive information can additionally introduce unnecessary noise, which may degrade the model performance. In this work, we study the PSI within data and develop FedRE, that can simultaneously achieve robustness and effectiveness benefits with LDP protection. More specifically, we first define PSI with regard to the privacy preferences of each client. Then, we optimize the LDP by allocating less privacy budget to gradients with higher PSI in a layer-wise manner, thus providing a stricter privacy guarantee for PSI. Furthermore, to mitigate the performance degradation caused by LDP, we design a parameter aggregation mechanism based on the distribution of the perturbed information. We conducted experiments with text tamper detection on T-SROIE and DocTamper datasets, and FedRE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ValuesRAG: Enhancing Cultural Alignment Through Retrieval-Augmented Contextual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01031v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, as these models often embed Western-centric biases from their training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness concerns in cross-cultural applications. Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems. Our findings underscore the potential of dynamic retrieval-based methods to bridge the gap between global LLM capabilities and localized cultural values.</p></details> | preprint |

Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose MaskAttn-UNet, a novel segmentation framework that enhances the traditional U-Net architecture via a mask attention mechanism. Our model selectively emphasizes important regions while suppressing irrelevant backgrounds, thereby improving segmentation accuracy in cluttered and complex scenes. Unlike conventional U-Net variants, MaskAttn-UNet effectively balances local feature extraction with broader contextual awareness, making it particularly well-suited for low-resolution inputs. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets with input images rescaled to 128x128 and demonstrate competitive performance across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks. Our results show that MaskAttn-UNet achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods at significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models, making it an efficient and scalable solution for low-resolution segmentation in resource-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Yet, a detailed theoretical characterization of this phenomenon is lacking. In this paper, we theoretically analyze retraining in a linearly separable binary classification setting with randomly corrupted labels given to us and prove that retraining can improve the population accuracy obtained by initially training with the given (noisy) labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such theoretical result. Retraining finds application in improving training with local label differential privacy (DP) which involves training with noisy labels. We empirically show that retraining selectively on the samples for which the predicted label matches the given label significantly improves label DP training at no extra privacy cost; we call this consensus-based retraining. As an example, when training ResNet-18 on CIFAR-100 with $\epsilon=3$ label DP, we obtain more than 6% improvement in accuracy with consensus-based retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICML 2025</p></details> |

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Purity Law for Generalizable Neural TSP Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04558v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving generalization in neural approaches across different scales and distributions remains a significant challenge for the Traveling Salesman Problem~(TSP). A key obstacle is that neural networks often fail to learn robust principles for identifying universal patterns and deriving optimal solutions from diverse instances. In this paper, we first uncover Purity Law (PuLa), a fundamental structural principle for optimal TSP solutions, defining that edge prevalence grows exponentially with the sparsity of surrounding vertices. Statistically validated across diverse instances, PuLa reveals a consistent bias toward local sparsity in global optima. Building on this insight, we propose Purity Policy Optimization~(PUPO), a novel training paradigm that explicitly aligns characteristics of neural solutions with PuLa during the solution construction process to enhance generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUPO can be seamlessly integrated with popular neural solvers, significantly enhancing their generalization performance without incurring additional computational overhead during inference.</p></details> |  |

However, limited-capacity accelerators require hybrid analog/digital algorithms to solve real-world problems, commonly using large-neighborhood local search (LNLS) frameworks. Unlike fully digital algorithms, hybrid LNLS has no non-asymptotic convergence guarantees and no principled hyperparameter selection schemes, particularly limiting cross-device training and inference. In this work, we provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for hybrid LNLS by reducing to block Langevin Diffusion (BLD) algorithms. Adapting tools from classical sampling theory, we prove exponential KL-divergence convergence for randomized and cyclic block selection strategies using ideal DXs. With finite device variation, we provide explicit bounds on the 2-Wasserstein bias in terms of step duration, noise strength, and function parameters. Our BLD model provides a key link between established theory and novel computing platforms, and our theoretical results provide a closed-form expression linking device variation, algorithm hyperparameters, and performance.</p></details> | 33 pages, 3 figures |

Unfortunately, the ever-increasing complexity of static analyzers makes their coding error-prone. Even analysis tools based on rigorous mathematical techniques, such as abstract interpretation, are not immune to bugs. Ensuring the correctness and reliability of software analyzers is critical if they are to be inserted in production compilers and development environments. While compiler validation has seen notable success, formal validation of static analysis tools remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for testing abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Broadly, it consists in checking, over a suite of benchmarks, that the properties inferred statically are satisfied dynamically. The main advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity, which stems directly from framing it within the Ciao assertion-based validation framework, and its blended static/dynamic assertion checking approach. We demonstrate that in this setting, the analysis can be tested with little effort by combining the following components already present in the framework: 1) the static analyzer, which outputs its results as the original program source with assertions interspersed; 2) the assertion run-time checking mechanism, which instruments a program to ensure that no assertion is violated at run time; 3) the random test case generator, which generates random test cases satisfying the properties present in assertion preconditions; and 4) the unit-test framework, which executes those test cases. We have applied our approach to the CiaoPP static analyzer, resulting in the identification of many bugs with reasonable overhead. Most of these bugs have been either fixed or confirmed, helping us detect a range of errors not only related to analysis soundness but also within other aspects of the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

Considering resource-constrained devices, FL clients often suffer from restricted transmission capacity. Aiming to enhance the system performance, the communication between clients and server needs to be diminished. Current FL strategies transmit a tremendous amount of data (model weights) within the FL process, which needs a high communication bandwidth. Considering resource constraints, increasing the number of clients and, consequently, the amount of data (model weights) can lead to a bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce the Federated Black Widow Optimization (FedBWO) technique to decrease the amount of transmitted data by transmitting only a performance score rather than the local model weights from clients. FedBWO employs the BWO algorithm to improve local model updates. The conducted experiments prove that FedBWO remarkably improves the performance of the global model and the communication efficiency of the overall system. According to the experimental outcomes, FedBWO enhances the global model accuracy by an average of 21% over FedAvg, and 12% over FedGWO. Furthermore, FedBWO dramatically decreases the communication cost compared to other methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5th I...</summary><p>5th IEEE International Conference on Human-Machine Systems, Abu Dhabi, UAE, 26-28 May 2025</p></details> |
| **[Localized Diffusion Models for High Dimensional Distributions Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04417v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art tools for various generative tasks. However, estimating high-dimensional score functions makes them potentially suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). This underscores the importance of better understanding and exploiting low-dimensional structure in the target distribution. In this work, we consider locality structure, which describes sparse dependencies between model components. Under locality structure, the score function is effectively low-dimensional, so that it can be estimated by a localized neural network with significantly reduced sample complexity. This motivates the localized diffusion model, where a localized score matching loss is used to train the score function within a localized hypothesis space. We prove that such localization enables diffusion models to circumvent CoD, at the price of additional localization error. Under realistic sample size scaling, we show both theoretically and numerically that a moderate localization radius can balance the statistical and localization error, leading to a better overall performance. The localized structure also facilitates parallel training of diffusion models, making it potentially more efficient for large-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Manifold Reconstruction and Representation with Topological and Geometrical Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04412v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manifold learning aims to discover and represent low-dimensional structures underlying high-dimensional data while preserving critical topological and geometric properties. Existing methods often fail to capture local details with global topological integrity from noisy data or construct a balanced dimensionality reduction, resulting in distorted or fractured embeddings. We present an AutoEncoder-based method that integrates a manifold reconstruction layer, which uncovers latent manifold structures from noisy point clouds, and further provides regularizations on topological and geometric properties during dimensionality reduction, whereas the two components promote each other during training. Experiments on point cloud datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines like t-SNE, UMAP, and Topological AutoEncoders in discovering manifold structures from noisy data and preserving them through dimensionality reduction, as validated by visualization and quantitative metrics. This work demonstrates the significance of combining manifold reconstruction with manifold learning to achieve reliable representation of the latent manifold, particularly when dealing with noisy real-world data.

These models are essential to Knowledge Graph Completion yet criticized for their opaque, black-box nature. Despite their significant success in capturing the semantics of knowledge graphs through high-dimensional latent representations, their inherent complexity poses substantial challenges to explainability. While existing methods like Kelpie use resource-intensive perturbation to explain KGE models, our approach directly decodes the latent representations encoded by KGE models, leveraging the smoothness of the embeddings, which follows the principle that similar embeddings reflect similar behaviours within the Knowledge Graph, meaning that nodes are similarly embedded because their graph neighbourhood looks similar. This principle is commonly referred to as smoothness. By identifying symbolic structures, in the form of triples, within the subgraph neighborhoods of similarly embedded entities, our method identifies the statistical regularities on which the models rely and translates these insights into human-understandable symbolic rules and facts. This bridges the gap between the abstract representations of KGE models and their predictive outputs, offering clear, interpretable insights. Key contributions include a novel post-hoc and local explainable AI method for KGE models that provides immediate, faithful explanations without retraining, facilitating real-time application on large-scale knowledge graphs. The method's flexibility enables the generation of rule-based, instance-based, and analogy-based explanations, meeting diverse user needs. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of our approach in delivering faithful and well-localized explanations, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of KGE models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Geometric Barycenters for Bayesian Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11646v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a widely used and impactful distributed optimization framework that achieves consensus through averaging locally trained models. While effective, this approach may not align well with Bayesian inference, where the model space has the structure of a distribution space. Taking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as the problem of finding the barycenter of local posteriors using a prespecified divergence metric, minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This perspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing methods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then propose BA-BFL, an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of Federated Averaging in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically distributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical aggregation techniques, showing that BA-BFL achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning, exploring the impact of Bayesian layers on uncertainty quantification and model calibration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Location Search for Identifying Maximum Weighted Independent Sets in Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04674v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Artificial intelligence (AI), including Generative AI, are effective at generating high-quality traffic data and optimization solutions in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), these techniques often demand significant training time and computational resources, especially in large-scale and complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP) technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for 350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177 instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed, highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: Federated Active Learning with Foundation Models for Communication-efficient Sampling and Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03783v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.</p></details> |  |

Despite their impressive adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic variations. Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on the distributional differences between egocentric and exocentric videos but often neglect key characteristics of egocentric videos and the fine-grained information emphasized by question-type queries. To address these limitations, we propose OSGNet, an Object-Shot enhanced Grounding Network for egocentric video. Specifically, we extract object information from videos to enrich video representation, particularly for objects highlighted in the textual query but not directly captured in the video features. Additionally, we analyze the frequent shot movements inherent to egocentric videos, leveraging these features to extract the wearer's attention information, which enhances the model's ability to perform modality alignment. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that OSGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering. The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.</p></details> | 9 pages, 17 figures |
| **[FRAIN to Train: A Fast-and-Reliable Solution for Decentralized Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04223v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data locality. Although FedAvg pioneered synchronous rounds for global model averaging, slower devices can delay collective progress. Asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync) addresses stragglers by continuously integrating client updates, yet naive implementations risk client drift due to non-IID data and stale contributions. Some Blockchain-based FL approaches (e.g., BRAIN) employ robust weighting or scoring of updates to resist malicious or misaligned proposals. However, performance drops can still persist under severe data heterogeneity or high staleness, and synchronization overhead has emerged as a new concern due to its aggregator-free architectures. We introduce Fast-and-Reliable AI Network, FRAIN, a new asynchronous FL method that mitigates these limitations by incorporating two key ideas. First, our FastSync strategy eliminates the need to replay past model versions, enabling newcomers and infrequent participants to efficiently approximate the global model. Second, we adopt spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) when merging parameters, preserving models' directions and alleviating destructive interference from divergent local training. Experiments with a CNN image-classification model and a Transformer-based language model demonstrate that FRAIN achieves more stable and robust convergence than FedAvg, FedAsync, and BRAIN, especially under harsh environments: non-IID data distributions, networks that experience delays and require frequent re-synchronization, and the presence of malicious nodes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coverage-Guaranteed Speech Emotion Recognition via Calibrated Uncertainty-Adaptive Prediction Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22712v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road rage, often triggered by emotional suppression and sudden outbursts, significantly threatens road safety by causing collisions and aggressive behavior. Speech emotion recognition technologies can mitigate this risk by identifying negative emotions early and issuing timely alerts. However, current SER methods, such as those based on hidden markov models and Long short-term memory networks, primarily handle one-dimensional signals, frequently experience overfitting, and lack calibration, limiting their safety-critical effectiveness. We propose a novel risk-controlled prediction framework providing statistically rigorous guarantees on prediction accuracy. This approach employs a calibration set to define a binary loss function indicating whether the true label is included in the prediction set. Using a data-driven threshold $\beta$, we optimize a joint loss function to maintain an expected test loss bounded by a user-specified risk level $\alpha$. Evaluations across six baseline models and two benchmark datasets demonstrate our framework consistently achieves a minimum coverage of $1 - \alpha$, effectively controlling marginal error rates despite varying calibration-test split ratios (e.g., 0.1). The robustness and generalizability of the framework are further validated through an extension to small-batch online calibration under a local exchangeability assumption. We construct a non-negative test martingale to maintain prediction validity even in dynamic and non-exchangeable environments. Cross-dataset tests confirm our method's ability to uphold reliable statistical guarantees in realistic, evolving data scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRGCN: Capturing Asynchronous Spatio-Temporal Dependencies for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04167v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in real-world applications across many fields, where varying sensor frequencies and asynchronous measurements pose significant modeling challenges. Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[LHT: Statistically-Driven Oblique Decision Trees for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04139v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Learning Hyperplane Tree (LHT), a novel oblique decision tree model designed for expressive and interpretable classification. LHT fundamentally distinguishes itself through a non-iterative, statistically-driven approach to constructing splitting hyperplanes. Unlike methods that rely on iterative optimization or heuristics, LHT directly computes the hyperplane parameters, which are derived from feature weights based on the differences in feature expectations between classes within each node. This deterministic mechanism enables a direct and well-defined hyperplane construction process. Predictions leverage a unique piecewise linear membership function within leaf nodes, obtained via local least-squares fitting. We formally analyze the convergence of the LHT splitting process, ensuring that each split yields meaningful, non-empty partitions. Furthermore, we establish that the time complexity for building an LHT up to depth $d$ is $O(mnd)$, demonstrating the practical feasibility of constructing trees with powerful oblique splits using this methodology. The explicit feature weighting at each split provides inherent interpretability. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate LHT's competitive accuracy, positioning it as a practical, theoretically grounded, and interpretable alternative in the landscape of tree-based models. The implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/Hongyi-Li-sz/LHT_model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Risks and Regulatory Strategies of Large Language Models in Digital Advertising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04665v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model (LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing, feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.</p></details> |  |

However, the internal organizational principles underlying different abstract rules remain poorly understood. We propose a hierarchically modulated recurrent spiking neural network (HM-RSNN), inspired by astrocyte signaling. The model globally configures and locally fine-tunes intrinsic neuronal properties via a two-stage neuromodulatory mechanism. This design enhances neuronal adaptability and diversity, thus enabling fine-grained analysis of internal organizational principles. We evaluate abstract rule emergence across four cognitive task sets. To probe internal organization, we examine network-level connectivity via structural modularity analysis and neuron-level functional biases via bin-wise lesion studies based on intrinsic properties. Our experiments show that HM-RSNN successfully achieves abstract rule emergence, with rule-contingent organizational principles evident at both network and neuron levels. These findings highlight the critical role of dynamic internal organization in supporting flexible cognition.</p></details> | 31 pages, 11 figures |

Many strategies have been proposed to guide test-case generation, such as source-code-based approaches and methods based on bug reports. Requirements-based test generation (RBTG) constructs test cases based on specified requirements, aligning with user needs and expectations, without requiring access to the source code. Since its introduction in 1994, there have been many contributions to the development of RBTG, including various approaches, implementations, tools, assessment and evaluation methods, and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on RBTG, categorizing requirement types, classifying approaches, investigating types of test cases, summarizing available tools, and analyzing experimental evaluations.

| **[Identification and Optimization of Redundant Code Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04040v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Redundant code is a persistent challenge in software development that makes systems harder to maintain, scale, and update. It adds unnecessary complexity, hinders bug fixes, and increases technical debt. Despite their impact, removing redundant code manually is risky and error-prone, often introducing new bugs or missing dependencies. While studies highlight the prevalence and negative impact of redundant code, little focus has been given to Artificial Intelligence (AI) system codebases and the common patterns that cause redundancy. Additionally, the reasons behind developers unintentionally introducing redundant code remain largely unexplored. This research addresses these gaps by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and optimize redundant code in AI projects. Our research aims to identify recurring patterns of redundancy and analyze their underlying causes, such as outdated practices or insufficient awareness of best coding principles. Additionally, we plan to propose an LLM agent that will facilitate the detection and refactoring of redundancies on a large scale while preserving original functionality. This work advances the application of AI in identifying and optimizing redundant code, ultimately helping developers maintain cleaner, more readable, and scalable codebases.</p></details> |  |

It ensures equitable solutions that address the needs of diverse populations. However, gender disparity persists in research where women remain underrepresented, which might limit diversity and innovation. Many even leave scientific careers as their contributions often go unnoticed and undervalued. Therefore, understanding gender-based contributions and collaboration dynamics is crucial to addressing this gap and creating a more inclusive research environment. In this study, we analyzed 2,000 articles published over the past decade in the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS). From these, we selected 384 articles that detailed authors' contributions and contained both female and male authors to investigate gender-based contributions. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we analyzed women's engagement in software systems research. Our analysis showed that only 32.74% of the total authors are women and female-led or supervised studies were fewer than those of men. Second, we investigated female authors' contributions across 14 major roles. Interestingly, we found that women contributed comparably to men in most roles, with more contributions in conceptualization, writing, and reviewing articles. Third, we explored the areas of software systems research and found that female authors are more actively involved in human-centric research domains. Finally, we analyzed gender-based collaboration dynamics. Our findings revealed that female supervisors tended to collaborate locally more often than national-level collaborations. Our study highlights that females' contributions to software systems research are comparable to those of men. Therefore, the barriers need to be addressed to enhance female participation and ensure equity and inclusivity in research.</p></details> |  |

Deadlines are a leading cause of the emergence of TD in software systems. While multiple aspects of TD have been studied, the empirical research findings on the impact of deadlines are still inconclusive. Aims: This study investigates the impact of scheduled deadlines on TD. It analyzes how scheduled deadlines affect code quality, commit activities, and issues in issue-tracking systems. Method: We analyzed eight Open Source Software (OSS) projects with regular release schedules using SonarQube. We analyzed 12.3k commits and 371 releases across these eight OSS projects. The study combined quantitative metrics with qualitative analyses to comprehensively understand TD accumulation under scheduled deadlines. Results: Our findings indicated that some projects had a clear increase in TD as deadlines approached (with above 50% of releases having increasing TD accumulation as deadlines approached), while others managed to maintain roughly the same amount of TD. Analysis of commit activities and issue tracking revealed that deadline proximity could lead to increased commit frequency and bug-related issue creation. Conclusions: Our study highlights that, in some cases, impending deadlines have a clear impact on TD. The findings pinpoint the need to mitigate last-minute coding rushes and the risks associated with deadline-driven TD accumulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

However, their sequential computation requirements lead to significant inference-time bottlenecks. In this work, we utilize the connection between DDPMs and Stochastic Localization to prove that, under an appropriate reparametrization, the increments of DDPM satisfy an exchangeability property. This general insight enables near-black-box adaptation of various performance optimization techniques from autoregressive models to the diffusion setting. To demonstrate this, we introduce \emph{Autospeculative Decoding} (ASD), an extension of the widely used speculative decoding algorithm to DDPMs that does not require any auxiliary draft models. Our theoretical analysis shows that ASD achieves a $\tilde{O} (K^{\frac{1}{3}})$ parallel runtime speedup over the $K$ step sequential DDPM. We also demonstrate that a practical implementation of autospeculative decoding accelerates DDPM inference significantly in various domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graphical Global Optimization Framework for Parameter Estimation of Statistical Models with Nonconvex Regularization Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03899v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization problems with norm-bounding constraints arise in a variety of applications, including portfolio optimization, machine learning, and feature selection. A common approach to these problems involves relaxing the norm constraint via Lagrangian relaxation, transforming it into a regularization term in the objective function. A particularly challenging class includes the zero-norm function, which promotes sparsity in statistical parameter estimation. Most existing exact methods for solving these problems introduce binary variables and artificial bounds to reformulate them as higher-dimensional mixed-integer programs, solvable by standard solvers. Other exact approaches exploit specific structural properties of the objective, making them difficult to generalize across different problem types. Alternative methods employ nonconvex penalties with favorable statistical characteristics, but these are typically addressed using heuristic or local optimization techniques due to their structural complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method to globally solve optimization problems involving generalized norm-bounding constraints. Our approach encompasses standard $\ell_p$-norms for $p \in [0, \infty)$ and nonconvex penalties such as SCAD and MCP. We leverage decision diagrams to construct strong convex relaxations directly in the original variable space, eliminating the need for auxiliary variables or artificial bounds. Integrated into a spatial branch-and-cut framework, our method guarantees convergence to the global optimum. We demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary computational experiments on benchmark sparse linear regression problems involving complex nonconvex penalties, which are not tractable using existing global optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonnegative Low-rank Matrix Recovery Can Have Spurious Local Minima](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03717v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classical low-rank matrix recovery problem is well-known to exhibit \emph{benign nonconvexity} under the restricted isometry property (RIP): local optimization is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum, where the ground truth is recovered. We investigate whether benign nonconvexity continues to hold when the factor matrices are constrained to be elementwise nonnegative -- a common practical requirement. In the simple setting of a rank-1 nonnegative ground truth, we confirm that benign nonconvexity holds in the fully-observed case with RIP constant $\delta=0$. Surprisingly, however, this property fails to extend to the partially-observed case with any arbitrarily small RIP constant $\delta\to0^{+}$, irrespective of rank overparameterization. This finding exposes a critical theoretical gap: the continuity argument widely used to explain the empirical robustness of low-rank matrix recovery fundamentally breaks down once nonnegative constraints are imposed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Global Guarantees for Nonconvex Low-rank Recovery in the Noisy Overparameterized Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10790v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work established that rank overparameterization eliminates spurious local minima in nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery under the restricted isometry property (RIP). But this does not fully explain the practical success of overparameterization, because real algorithms can still become trapped at nonstrict saddle points (approximate second-order points with arbitrarily small negative curvature) even when all local minima are global. Moreover, the result does not accommodate for noisy measurements, but it is unclear whether such an extension is even possible, in view of the many discontinuous and unintuitive behaviors already known for the overparameterized regime. In this paper, we introduce a novel proof technique that unifies, simplifies, and strengthens two previously competing approaches -- one based on escape directions and the other based on the inexistence of counterexample -- to provide sharp global guarantees in the noisy overparameterized regime. We show, once local minima have been converted into global minima through slight overparameterization, that near-second-order points achieve the same minimax-optimal recovery bounds (up to small constant factors) as significantly more expensive convex approaches. Our results are sharp with respect to the noise level and the solution accuracy, and hold for both the symmetric parameterization $XX^{T}$, as well as the asymmetric parameterization $UV^{T}$ under a balancing regularizer; we demonstrate that the balancing regularizer is indeed necessary.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 co...</summary><p>v2 corrects minor typos; v3 complete overhaul with new results on minimax-optimal recovery under noise and asymmetric factorization</p></details> |

Leveraging physically informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental evaluations, covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and multilingual speech recognition, demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior noise suppression, minimal latency, and robust accuracy in demanding real-world scenarios.

| **[ALMA: Aggregated Lipschitz Maximization Attack on Auto-encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03646v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the extensive use of deep autoencoders (AEs) in critical applications, their adversarial robustness remains relatively underexplored compared to classification models. AE robustness is characterized by the Lipschitz bounds of its components. Existing robustness evaluation frameworks based on white-box attacks do not fully exploit the vulnerabilities of intermediate ill-conditioned layers in AEs. In the context of optimizing imperceptible norm-bounded additive perturbations to maximize output damage, existing methods struggle to effectively propagate adversarial loss gradients throughout the network, often converging to less effective perturbations. To address this, we propose a novel layer-conditioning-based adversarial optimization objective that effectively guides the adversarial map toward regions of local Lipschitz bounds by enhancing loss gradient information propagation during attack optimization. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art AEs that our adversarial objective results in stronger attacks, outperforming existing methods in both universal and sample-specific scenarios. As a defense method against this attack, we introduce an inference-time adversarially trained defense plugin that mitigates the effects of adversarial examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Role of Diversity in Example Selection for In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01842v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Learning (ICL) has gained prominence due to its ability to perform tasks without requiring extensive training data and its robustness to noisy labels. A typical ICL workflow involves selecting localized examples relevant to a given input using sparse or dense embedding-based similarity functions. However, relying solely on similarity-based selection may introduce topical biases in the retrieved contexts, potentially leading to suboptimal downstream performance. We posit that reranking the retrieved context to enhance topical diversity can improve downstream task performance. To achieve this, we leverage maximum marginal relevance (MMR) which balances topical similarity with inter-example diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that diversifying the selected examples leads to consistent improvements in downstream performance across various context sizes and similarity functions. The implementation of our approach is made available at https://github.com/janak11111/Diverse-ICL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rainbow Delay Compensation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mitigating Delayed Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03586v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state. An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.

This paper introduces BCause, a discussion system leveraging generative AI and human-machine collaboration to transform unstructured dialogue around public issues (such as urban living, policy changes, and current socio-economic transformations) into structured, actionable democratic processes. We present three innovations: (i) importing and transforming unstructured transcripts into argumentative discussions, (ii) geo-deliberated problem-sensing via a Telegram bot for local issue reporting, and (iii) smart reporting with customizable widgets (e.g., summaries, topic modelling, policy recommendations, clustered arguments). The system's human-AI partnership preserves critical human participation to ensure ethical oversight, contextual relevance, and creative synthesis.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Differentially Private Densest-$k$-Subgraph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03858v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many graph datasets involve sensitive network data, motivating the need for privacy-preserving graph mining. The Densest-$k$-subgraph (D$k$S) problem is a key primitive in graph mining that aims to extract a subset of $k$ vertices with the maximum internal connectivity. Although non-private algorithms are known for D$k$S, this paper is the first to design algorithms that offer formal differential privacy (DP) guarantees for the problem. We base our general approach on using the principal component (PC) of the graph adjacency matrix to output a subset of $k$ vertices under edge DP. For this task, we first consider output perturbation, which traditionally offer good scalability, but at the expense of utility. Our tight on the local sensitivity indicate a big gap with the global sensitivity, motivating the use of instance specific sensitive methods for private PC. Next, we derive a tight bound on the smooth sensitivity and show that it can be close to the global sensitivity. This leads us to consider the Propose-Test-Release (PTR) framework for private PC. Although computationally expensive in general, we design a novel approach for implementing PTR in the same time as computation of a non-private PC, while offering good utility for \DkS{}. Additionally, we also consider the iterative private power method (PPM) for private PC, albeit it is significantly slower than PTR on large networks. We run our methods on diverse real-world networks, with the largest having 3 million vertices, and show good privacy-utility trade-offs. Although PTR requires a slightly larger privacy budget, on average, it achieves a 180-fold improvement in runtime over PPM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small-Scale-Fading-Aware Resource Allocation in Wireless Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03533v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Judicious resource allocation can effectively enhance federated learning (FL) training performance in wireless networks by addressing both system and statistical heterogeneity. However, existing strategies typically rely on block fading assumptions, which overlooks rapid channel fluctuations within each round of FL gradient uploading, leading to a degradation in FL training performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a small-scale-fading-aware resource allocation strategy using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Specifically, we establish a one-step convergence bound of the FL algorithm and formulate the resource allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which is subsequently solved using the QMIX algorithm. In our framework, each client serves as an agent that dynamically determines spectrum and power allocations within each coherence time slot, based on local observations and a reward derived from the convergence analysis. The MARL setting reduces the dimensionality of the action space and facilitates decentralized decision-making, enhancing the scalability and practicality of the solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our QMIX-based resource allocation strategy significantly outperforms baseline methods across various degrees of statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, ablation studies validate the critical importance of incorporating small-scale fading dynamics, highlighting its role in optimizing FL performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSMamba: Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba with Dual-Domain Prior Generator for Exposure Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15255v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exposure correction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and image processing. Recently, frequency domain-based methods have achieved impressive improvement, yet they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios under extreme exposure conditions. This is due to the local convolutional receptive fields failing to model long-range dependencies in the spectrum, and the non-generative learning paradigm being inadequate for retrieving lost details from severely degraded regions. In this paper, we propose Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba (OSMamba), a novel exposure correction network that incorporates the advantages of state space models and generative diffusion models to address these limitations. Specifically, OSMamba introduces an omnidirectional spectral scanning mechanism that adapts Mamba to the frequency domain to capture comprehensive long-range dependencies in both the amplitude and phase spectra of deep image features, hence enhancing illumination correction and structure recovery. Furthermore, we develop a dual-domain prior generator that learns from well-exposed images to generate a degradation-free diffusion prior containing correct information about severely under- and over-exposed regions for better detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple-exposure and mixed-exposure datasets demonstrate that the proposed OSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taking a Big Step: Large Learning Rates in Denoising Score Matching Prevent Memorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03435v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising score matching plays a pivotal role in the performance of diffusion-based generative models. However, the empirical optimal score--the exact solution to the denoising score matching--leads to memorization, where generated samples replicate the training data. Yet, in practice, only a moderate degree of memorization is observed, even without explicit regularization. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by uncovering an implicit regularization mechanism driven by large learning rates. Specifically, we show that in the small-noise regime, the empirical optimal score exhibits high irregularity. We then prove that, when trained by stochastic gradient descent with a large enough learning rate, neural networks cannot stably converge to a local minimum with arbitrarily small excess risk. Consequently, the learned score cannot be arbitrarily close to the empirical optimal score, thereby mitigating memorization. To make the analysis tractable, we consider one-dimensional data and two-layer neural networks. Experiments validate the crucial role of the learning rate in preventing memorization, even beyond the one-dimensional setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13754v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole-slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to bridge patch-level predictions to whole-slide image-level classifications seamlessly. We verified the CMSwinKAN on the publicly available BreakHis dataset and the PpNTs dataset, which was established by our hospital. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/CMSwinKAN.</p></details> | 10pages, 8 figures |

However, existing UI agents usually demand powerful large language models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, raising huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pre-trained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption.

However, they still face significant challenges in clinical use, including limited accuracy with multimodal content and insufficient validation in real-world settings. We propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A self-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming a closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into semantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities. It achieved a 23.5% relative improvement in cell segmentation from microscopy images over prior methods. RCMed's strong vision-language alignment enables exceptional generalization, with state-of-the-art performance in external validation across 20 clinically significant cancer types, including novel tasks. This work demonstrates how integrated multimodal models capture fine-grained patterns, enabling human-level interpretation in complex scenarios and advancing human-centric AI healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularized second-order optimization of tensor-network Born machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18691v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor-network Born machines (TNBMs) are quantum-inspired generative models for learning data distributions. Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability and efficiency, and demonstrating its potential as a robust and scalable approach for optimizing quantum-inspired generative models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Causal Structure Representation Learning of Confounders in Latent Space for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03382v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring user preferences from the historical feedback of users is a valuable problem in recommender systems. Conventional approaches often rely on the assumption that user preferences in the feedback data are equivalent to the real user preferences without additional noise, which simplifies the problem modeling. However, there are various confounders during user-item interactions, such as weather and even the recommendation system itself. Therefore, neglecting the influence of confounders will result in inaccurate user preferences and suboptimal performance of the model. Furthermore, the unobservability of confounders poses a challenge in further addressing the problem. To address these issues, we refine the problem and propose a more rational solution. Specifically, we consider the influence of confounders, disentangle them from user preferences in the latent space, and employ causal graphs to model their interdependencies without specific labels. By cleverly combining local and global causal graphs, we capture the user-specificity of confounders on user preferences. We theoretically demonstrate the identifiability of the obtained causal graph. Finally, we propose our model based on Variational Autoencoders, named Causal Structure representation learning of Confounders in latent space (CSC). We conducted extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and five real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned causal representations of confounders are controllable, potentially offering users fine-grained control over the objectives of their recommendation lists with the learned causal graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13460v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in learning configuration-space distance functions (CDFs) as robot body representations, we propose a unified framework for motion planning and control that formulates safety constraints as CDF barriers. A CDF barrier approximates the local free configuration space, substantially reducing the number of collision-checking operations during motion planning. However, learning a CDF barrier with a neural network and relying on online sensor observations introduce uncertainties that must be considered during control synthesis. To address this, we develop a distributionally robust CDF barrier formulation for control that explicitly accounts for modeling errors and sensor noise without assuming a known underlying distribution. Simulations and hardware experiments on a 6-DoF xArm manipulator show that our neural CDF barrier formulation enables efficient planning and robust real-time safe control in cluttered and dynamic environments, relying only on onboard point-cloud observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnifyFL: Enabling Decentralized Cross-Silo Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18916v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) paradigm in which models are trained on private data across several devices called clients and combined at a single node called an aggregator rather than aggregating the data itself. Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware ML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate independently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to the lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in balancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a third-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel FL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable. Alternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local models directly, which requires significant computational resources for validation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and resource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we develop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called UnifyFL, which uses decentralized orchestration and distributed storage. UnifyFL provides flexibility to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and asynchronous modes to handle stragglers. Our evaluation on a diverse testbed shows that UnifyFL achieves a performance comparable to the ideal multilevel centralized FL while allowing trust and optimal use of resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables.

Traditional approaches apply fixed thresholds or treat labels independently, overlooking context and global rarity. We introduce an adaptive thresholding mechanism that fuses global (IDF-based) and local (KNN-based) signals to produce per-label, per-instance thresholds. Instead of applying these as hard cutoffs, we treat them as differentiable penalties in the loss, providing smooth supervision and better calibration. Our architecture is lightweight, interpretable, and highly modular. On the AmazonCat-13K benchmark, it achieves a macro-F1 of 0.1712, substantially outperforming tree-based and pretrained transformer-based methods. We release full code for reproducibility and future extensions.</p></details> |  |

Specifications for such systems are often standardized in natural language documents, like Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specifications or IETF RFC's. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in both generating tests and handling large volumes of natural language text, making them well-suited for analyzing artifacts like specification documents, bug reports, and code implementations. In this work, we leverage natural language and code artifacts to guide LLMs to generate targeted tests that highlight meaningful behavioral differences between implementations, including those corresponding to bugs. We introduce DiffSpec, a framework for generating differential tests with LLMs using prompt chaining. We demonstrate DiffSpec's efficacy on two different (extensively tested) systems, eBPF runtimes and Wasm validators. Using DiffSpec, we generated 1901 differentiating tests, uncovering at least four distinct and confirmed bugs in eBPF, including a kernel memory leak, inconsistent behavior in jump instructions, undefined behavior when using the stack pointer, and tests with infinite loops that hang the verifier in ebpf-for-windows. We also found 299 differentiating tests in Wasm validators pointing to two confirmed and fixed bugs.</p></details> |  |

Recent work on audio LMs has primarily evaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30 seconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments that more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We introduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio benchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation, emotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in length. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each paired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers. Our audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent a human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them, including advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the tasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that audio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as duration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning, counting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on prompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework to develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of machine translation (MT) performance on bug reports, analyzing the capabilities of DeepL, AWS Translate, and large language models such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and Mistral using data from the Visual Studio Code GitHub repository, specifically focusing on reports labeled with the english-please tag. To assess both translation quality and source language identification accuracy, we employ a range of MT evaluation metrics-including BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, METEOR, and ROUGE-alongside classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings reveal that while ChatGPT (gpt-4o) excels in semantic and lexical translation quality, it does not lead in source language identification. Claude and Mistral achieve the highest F1-scores (0.7182 and 0.7142, respectively), and Gemini records the best precision (0.7414). AWS Translate shows the highest accuracy (0.4717) in identifying source languages. These results highlight that no single system dominates across all tasks, reinforcing the importance of task-specific evaluations. This study underscores the need for domain adaptation when translating technical content and provides actionable insights for integrating MT into bug-triaging workflows.

However, forecasts produced by machine learning models or numerical weather prediction systems are typically generated on large-scale regular grids, where direct downscaling fails to capture fine-grained, near-surface weather patterns. In this work, we propose a multi-modal transformer model trained end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. Our model directly combines local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature, dewpoint) with gridded forecasts to produce locally accurate predictions at various lead times. Multiple data modalities are collected and concatenated at station-level locations, treated as a token at each station. Using self-attention, the token corresponding to the target location aggregates information from its neighboring tokens. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. They also reveal that direct input of station data provides a phase shift in local weather forecasting accuracy, reducing the prediction error by up to 80% compared to pure gridded data based models. This approach demonstrates how to bridge the gap between large-scale weather models and locally accurate forecasts to support high-stakes, location-sensitive decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lesion-Aware Generative Artificial Intelligence for Virtual Contrast-Enhanced Mammography in Breast Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03018v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.</p></details> |  |

Existing hyperbolic aggregation schemes, while curvature-aware, may not sufficiently capture the intricate structural differences required to robustly distinguish non-isomorphic graphs owing to non-injective aggregation functions. To address this expressiveness gap in hyperbolic graph learning, we introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel GNN designed to achieve enhanced discriminative capabilities within the Lorentzian model of hyperbolic space. LGIN proposes a new update rule that effectively combines local neighborhood information with a richer representation of graph structure designed to preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor. This represents a significant step towards building more expressive GNNs in non-Euclidean geometries, overcoming a common bottleneck in current hyperbolic methods. We conduct extensive evaluations across nine diverse benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures. LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean GNNs, showcasing its practical efficacy and validating its superior ability to capture complex graph structures and distinguish between different graphs. To the best of our knowledge, LGIN is the first work to study the framework behind a powerful GNN on the hyperbolic space.

| **[The Art of Repair: Optimizing Iterative Program Repair with Instruction-Tuned Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02931v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic program repair (APR) aims to reduce the manual efforts required to identify and fix errors in source code. Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs. We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J. Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the research track of the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, T\"urkiye</p></details> |
| **[Clients Collaborate: Flexible Differentially Private Federated Learning with Guaranteed Improvement of Utility-Privacy Trade-off](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07002v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To defend against privacy leakage of user data, differential privacy is widely used in federated learning, but it is not free. The addition of noise randomly disrupts the semantic integrity of the model and this disturbance accumulates with increased communication rounds. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated learning framework with rigorous privacy guarantees, named FedCEO, designed to strike a trade-off between model utility and user privacy by letting clients ''Collaborate with Each Other''. Specifically, we perform efficient tensor low-rank proximal optimization on stacked local model parameters at the server, demonstrating its capability to flexibly truncate high-frequency components in spectral space. This capability implies that our FedCEO can effectively recover the disrupted semantic information by smoothing the global semantic space for different privacy settings and continuous training processes. Moreover, we improve the SOTA utility-privacy trade-off bound by order of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the input dimension. We illustrate our theoretical results with experiments on representative datasets and observe significant performance improvements and strict privacy guarantees under different privacy settings. The code is available at https://github.com/6lyc/FedCEO_Collaborate-with-Each-Other.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Local Markov Equivalence and Local Causal Discovery for Identifying Controlled Direct Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02781v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and identifying controlled direct effects (CDEs) is crucial across numerous scientific domains, including public health. While existing methods can identify these effects from causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the true underlying structure is often unknown in practice. Essential graphs, which represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same set of d-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative. However, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and typically depends on strong, untestable assumptions. In this work, we characterize a local class of graphs, defined relative to a target variable, that share a specific subset of d-separations, and introduce a graphical representation of this class, called the local essential graph (LEG). We then present LocPC, a novel algorithm designed to recover the LEG from an observed distribution using only local conditional independence tests. Building on LocPC, we propose LocPC-CDE, an algorithm that discovers the portion of the LEG that is sufficient to identify a CDE, bypassing the need of retrieving the full essential graph. Compared to global methods, our algorithms require less conditional independence tests and operate under weaker assumptions while maintaining theoretical guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Although many general-purpose tools exist for landmark localization in classical computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation, they lack the specialized features and modularity necessary for anatomical landmark localization applications in the medical domain. Therefore, we introduce landmarker, a Python package built on PyTorch. The package provides a comprehensive, flexible toolkit for developing and evaluating landmark localization algorithms, supporting a range of methodologies, including static and adaptive heatmap regression. landmarker enhances the accuracy of landmark identification, streamlines research and development processes, and supports various image formats and preprocessing pipelines. Its modular design allows users to customize and extend the toolkit for specific datasets and applications, accelerating innovation in medical imaging. landmarker addresses a critical need for precision and customization in landmark localization tasks not adequately met by existing general-purpose pose estimation tools.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First authorship shared by Benjamin Ellenberger and Paul Haider</p></details> |
| **[FissionVAE: Federated Non-IID Image Generation with Latent Space and Decoder Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17090v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables decentralized clients to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping all the training data local. While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Non-IID data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We thereby introduce FissionVAE that decouples the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we incorporate hierarchical VAEs and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within FissionVAE. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decoupling process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images. Our experiments demonstrate that FissionVAE greatly improves generation quality on these datasets compared to baseline federated VAE models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Knowledge-Guided Localized Global Distribution Alignment for Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06457v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data heterogeneity in federated learning, characterized by a significant misalignment between local and global distributions, leads to divergent local optimization directions and hinders global model training. Existing studies mainly focus on optimizing local updates or global aggregation, but these indirect approaches demonstrate instability when handling highly heterogeneous data distributions, especially in scenarios where label skew and domain skew coexist. To address this, we propose a geometry-guided data generation method that centers on simulating the global embedding distribution locally. We first introduce the concept of the geometric shape of an embedding distribution and then address the challenge of obtaining global geometric shapes under privacy constraints. Subsequently, we propose GGEUR, which leverages global geometric shapes to guide the generation of new samples, enabling a closer approximation to the ideal global distribution. In single-domain scenarios, we augment samples based on global geometric shapes to enhance model generalization; in multi-domain scenarios, we further employ class prototypes to simulate the global distribution across domains. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of existing approaches in handling highly heterogeneous data, including scenarios with label skew, domain skew, and their coexistence.

However, PVRs face critical challenges in the context of policy learning, including temporal entanglement and an inability to generalise even in the presence of minor scene perturbations. These limitations hinder performance in tasks requiring temporal awareness and robustness to scene changes. This work identifies these shortcomings and proposes solutions to address them. First, we augment PVR features with temporal perception and a sense of task completion, effectively disentangling them in time. Second, we introduce a module that learns to selectively attend to task-relevant local features, enhancing robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution scenes. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly in PVRs trained with masking objectives, and validate the effectiveness of our enhancements in addressing PVR-specific limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tsagkas.github.io/pvrobo/</p></details> |
| **[Corr2Distrib: Making Ambiguous Correspondences an Ally to Predict Reliable 6D Pose Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02501v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Corr2Distrib, the first correspondence-based method which estimates a 6D camera pose distribution from an RGB image, explaining the observations. Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities, leading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this problem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP Challenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose solution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not straightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities drastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these ambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first learns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's surface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation enables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D correspondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution using PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex non-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from an RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, traditional methods often neglect causal relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method based on backtracking counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides deeper insights into model outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19820v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on graph neural networks (GNNs) has explored mechanisms for capturing local uncertainty and exploiting graph hierarchies to mitigate data sparsity and leverage structural properties. However, the synergistic integration of these two approaches remains underexplored. This work introduces a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Network (HU-GNN), which unifies multi-scale representation learning, principled uncertainty estimation, and self-supervised embedding diversity within a single end-to-end framework. Specifically, HU-GNN adaptively forms node clusters and estimates uncertainty at multiple structural scales from individual nodes to higher levels. These uncertainty estimates guide a robust message-passing mechanism and attention weighting, effectively mitigating noise and adversarial perturbations while preserving predictive accuracy on semi-supervised classification tasks. We also offer key theoretical contributions, including a probabilistic formulation, rigorous uncertainty-calibration guarantees, and formal robustness bounds. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art robustness and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

| **[Quantitative Analysis of Performance Drop in DeepSeek Model Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02390v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally, possibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some organizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment offers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration exceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization is a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However, it is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being quantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of multi-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key findings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance degradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard NVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization method that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various benchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach in most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment configurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of DQ3\_K\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing optimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on manually crafted annotations -- labeling functions as sources or sinks -- to track data flows, e.g., ensuring that allocated memory is eventually freed, and code analysis tools such as CodeQL, Infer, or Cooddy can use function specifications, but manual annotation is laborious and error-prone, especially for large or third-party libraries. We present LAMeD (LLM-generated Annotations for Memory leak Detection), a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate function-specific annotations. When integrated with analyzers such as Cooddy, LAMeD significantly improves memory leak detection and reduces path explosion. We also suggest directions for extending LAMeD to broader code analysis.</p></details> |  |

While existing solutions rely on noise injection, regularization, or gradient clipping, we propose a novel solution that purely controls the $l^p$ training norm to mitigate CO. Our study is motivated by the empirical observation that CO is more prevalent under the $l^{\infty}$ norm than the $l^2$ norm. Leveraging this insight, we develop a framework for generalized $l^p$ attack as a fixed point problem and craft $l^p$-FGSM attacks to understand the transition mechanics from $l^2$ to $l^{\infty}$. This leads to our core insight: CO emerges when highly concentrated gradients where information localizes in few dimensions interact with aggressive norm constraints. By quantifying gradient concentration through Participation Ratio and entropy measures, we develop an adaptive $l^p$-FGSM that automatically tunes the training norm based on gradient information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong robustness without requiring additional regularization or noise injection, providing a novel and theoretically-principled pathway to mitigate the CO problem.</p></details> |  |

Users can adjust these PID parameters during flight. However, flight control programs lack sufficient safety checks on user-provided PID parameters, leading to a severe UAV vulnerability - the input validation bug. This occurs when a user misconfigures PID parameters, causing dangerous states like deviation from the expected path, loss of control, or crash. Prior works use random testing like fuzzing, but these are not effective in the three-dimensional search space of PID parameters. The expensive dynamic execution of UAV tests further hinders random testing performance. We address PID parameter misconfiguration by combining the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion with coordinate search, introducing RouthSearch. Instead of ad-hoc identification, RouthSearch principledly determines valid ranges for three-dimensional PID parameters. We first leverage the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion to identify a theoretical PID parameter boundary, then refine it using efficient coordinate search. The determined valid range can filter misconfigured PID parameters from users during flight and help discover logical bugs in flight control programs. We evaluated RouthSearch across eight flight modes in PX4 and Ardupilot. Results show RouthSearch determines valid ranges with 92.0% accuracy compared to ground truth. RouthSearch discovers 3,853 PID misconfigurations within 48 hours, while the STOA work PGFuzz discovers only 449 sets, significantly outperforming prior works by 8.58 times. Our method also helped detect three bugs in ArduPilot and PX4.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34rd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |

Distinguishing between heuristic-based human adaptation and rule-based AI search, we model interactions across modular (parallel) and sequenced (interdependent) tasks using an NK model. Our results reveal that in modular tasks, AI often substitutes for humans - delivering higher payoffs unless human expertise is very high, and the AI search space is either narrowly focused or extremely broad. In sequenced tasks, interesting complementarities emerge. When an expert human initiates the search and AI subsequently refines it, aggregate performance is maximized. Conversely, when AI leads, excessive heuristic refinement by the human can reduce payoffs. We also show that even "hallucinatory" AI - lacking memory or structure - can improve outcomes when augmenting low-capability humans by helping escape local optima. These results yield a robust implication: the effectiveness of AI-human collaboration depends less on context or industry, and more on the underlying task structure. By elevating task decomposition as the central unit of analysis, our model provides a transferable lens for strategic decision-making involving humans and an agentic AI across diverse organizational settings.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce srcVul, a scalable, precise detection approach that combines program slicing with Locality-Sensitive Hashing to identify vulnerable code clones and recommend patches. srcVul builds a database of vulnerability-related slices by analyzing known vulnerable programs and their corresponding patches, indexing each slice's unique structural characteristics as a vulnerability slicing vector. During clone detection, srcVul efficiently matches slicing vectors from target programs with those in the database, recommending patches upon identifying similarities. Our evaluation of srcVul against three state-of-the-art vulnerable clone detectors demonstrates its accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, achieving 91% precision and 75% recall on established vulnerability databases and open-source repositories. These results highlight srcVul's effectiveness in detecting complex vulnerability patterns across diverse codebases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model with Region-guided Referring and Grounding for CT Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15539v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computed tomography (CT) report generation is crucial to assist radiologists in interpreting CT volumes, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Existing methods primarily only consider the global features of the entire volume, making it struggle to focus on specific regions and potentially missing abnormalities. To address this issue, we propose Reg2RG, the first region-guided referring and grounding framework for CT report generation, which enhances diagnostic performance by focusing on anatomical regions within the volume. Specifically, we utilize masks from a universal segmentation module to capture local features for each referring region. A local feature decoupling (LFD) strategy is proposed to preserve the local high-resolution details with little computational overhead. Then the local features are integrated with global features to capture inter-regional relationships within a cohesive context. Moreover, we propose a novel region-report alignment (RRA) training strategy. It leverages the recognition of referring regions to guide the generation of region-specific reports, enhancing the model's referring and grounding capabilities while also improving the report's interpretability. A large language model (LLM) is further employed as the language decoder to generate reports from integrated visual features, facilitating region-level comprehension. Extensive experiments on two large-scale chest CT-report datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics while preserving promising interpretability.

Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.</p></details> | 33 pages, 9 figures |

Flat modes represent robust solutions and have broad applications in combinatorial optimization and discrete generative modeling. However, existing sampling algorithms often overlook the mode volume and struggle to capture flat modes effectively. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Entropic Discrete Langevin Proposal} (EDLP), which incorporates local entropy into the sampling process through a continuous auxiliary variable under a joint distribution. The local entropy term guides the discrete sampler toward flat modes with a small overhead. We provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for EDLP in locally log-concave discrete distributions. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms traditional approaches across tasks that require sampling from flat basins, including Bernoulli distribution, restricted Boltzmann machines, combinatorial optimization, and binary neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A simple connection from loss flatness to compressed neural representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01770v4)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharpness, a geometric measure in the parameter space that reflects the flatness of the loss landscape, has long been studied for its potential connections to neural network behavior. While sharpness is often associated with generalization, recent work highlights inconsistencies in this relationship, leaving its true significance unclear. In this paper, we investigate how sharpness influences the local geometric features of neural representations in feature space, offering a new perspective on its role. We introduce this problem and study three measures for compression: the Local Volumetric Ratio (LVR), based on volume compression, the Maximum Local Sensitivity (MLS), based on sensitivity to input changes, and the Local Dimensionality, based on how uniform the sensitivity is on different directions. We show that LVR and MLS correlate with the flatness of the loss around the local minima; and that this correlation is predicted by a relatively simple mathematical relationship: a flatter loss corresponds to a lower upper bound on the compression metrics of neural representations. Our work builds upon the linear stability insight by Ma and Ying, deriving inequalities between various compression metrics and quantities involving sharpness. Our inequalities readily extend to reparametrization-invariant sharpness as well. Through empirical experiments on various feedforward, convolutional, and transformer architectures, we find that our inequalities predict a consistently positive correlation between local representation compression and sharpness.</p></details> |  |

However, these advancements come with trade-offs: achieving high performance often entails exponential computational costs, reduced interpretability, and an increasing dependence on data-intensive models with hundreds of billions of parameters. In this paper, we propose Neurosymbolic Software Engineering, in short NSE, as a promising paradigm combining neural learning with symbolic (rule-based) reasoning, while strategically introducing a controlled source of chaos to simulate the complex dynamics of real-world software systems. This hybrid methodology aims to enhance efficiency, reliability, and transparency in AI-driven software engineering while introducing controlled randomness to adapt to evolving requirements, unpredictable system behaviors, and non-deterministic execution environments. By redefining the core principles of AI-driven software engineering automation, NSE lays the groundwork for solutions that are more adaptable, transparent, and closely aligned with the evolving demands of modern software development practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Face Recognition via Improved Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03837v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biometric authentication has become one of the most widely used tools in the current technological era to authenticate users and to distinguish between genuine users and imposters. Face is the most common form of biometric modality that has proven effective. Deep learning-based face recognition systems are now commonly used across different domains. However, these systems usually operate like black-box models that do not provide necessary explanations or justifications for their decisions. This is a major disadvantage because users cannot trust such artificial intelligence-based biometric systems and may not feel comfortable using them when clear explanations or justifications are not provided. This paper addresses this problem by applying an efficient method for explainable face recognition systems. We use a Class Activation Mapping (CAM)-based discriminative localization (very narrow/specific localization) technique called Scaled Directed Divergence (SDD) to visually explain the results of deep learning-based face recognition systems. We perform fine localization of the face features relevant to the deep learning model for its prediction/decision. Our experiments show that the SDD Class Activation Map (CAM) highlights the relevant face features very specifically compared to the traditional CAM and very accurately. The provided visual explanations with narrow localization of relevant features can ensure much-needed transparency and trust for deep learning-based face recognition systems.</p></details> |  |

However, to broaden the adoption of the technology in the real world, we require robust navigation stacks relying only on low-cost sensors such as depth cameras. This paper presents a first step towards a robust localization, mapping, and navigation system for low-cost quadruped robots. In pursuit of this objective we combine contact-aided kinematic, visual-inertial odometry, and depth-stabilized vision, enhancing stability and accuracy of the system. Our results in simulation and two different real-world quadruped platforms show that our system can generate an accurate 2D map of the environment, robustly localize itself, and navigate autonomously. Furthermore, we present in-depth ablation studies of the important components of the system and their impact on localization accuracy.

| **[Bayesian Federated Cause-of-Death Classification and Quantification Under Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02257v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In regions lacking medically certified causes of death, verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical and widely used tool to ascertain the cause of death through interviews with caregivers. Data collected by VAs are often analyzed using probabilistic algorithms. The performance of these algorithms often degrades due to distributional shift across populations. Most existing VA algorithms rely on centralized training, requiring full access to training data for joint modeling. This is often infeasible due to privacy and logistical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) framework that avoids data sharing across multiple training sources. Our method enables reliable individual-level cause-of-death classification and population-level quantification of cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs), in a target domain with limited or no local labeled data. The proposed framework is modular, computationally efficient, and compatible with a wide range of existing VA algorithms as candidate models, facilitating flexible deployment in real-world mortality surveillance systems. We validate the performance of BFL through extensive experiments on two real-world VA datasets under varying levels of distribution shift. Our results show that BFL significantly outperforms the base models built on a single domain and achieves comparable or better performance compared to joint modeling.</p></details> | 11 figures |

Despite their predictive power, these models often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling the implicit dense edge structures created by a cut-off radius. To tackle this, we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs, which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.</p></details> |  |

The absence of comprehensive best practices for feature toggle usage often results in improper implementation, causing code quality issues. Although certain feature toggle usage patterns are prone to toggle smells, there is no tool as of today for software engineers to detect toggle usage patterns from the source code. This paper presents a tool TS-Detector to detect five different toggle usage patterns across ten open-source software projects in six different programming languages. We conducted a manual evaluation and results show that the true positive rates of detecting Spread, Nested, and Dead toggles are 80%, 86.4%, and 66.6% respectively, and the true negative rate of Mixed and Enum usages was 100%. The tool can be downloaded from its GitHub repository and can be used following the instructions provided there.</p></details> | <details><summary>33rd ...</summary><p>33rd ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering, June 23--28, 2025, Trondheim, Norway</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Chain of Thoughts via Elastic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05315v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Software Development Life Cycle Perspective: A Survey of Benchmarks for Code Large Language Models and Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05283v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach utilizing a vision transformer (ViT) architecture with DINO-v2 pretrained weights to model indoor radio propagation. Our method processes a floor map with additional features of the walls to generate indoor pathloss maps. We systematically evaluate the effects of architectural choices, data augmentation strategies, and feature engineering techniques. Our findings indicate that extensive augmentation significantly improves generalization, while feature engineering is crucial in low-data regimes. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of our model across different generalization scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work partly supported by the RA Science Committee grant No. 22rl-052 (DISTAL) and the EU under Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan of NextGenerationEU on "Telecommunications of the Future" (PE00000001 - program "RESTART")</p></details> |
| **[Type-Constrained Code Generation with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09246v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code generation. However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because their next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code. Although constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue, it has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or syntactic features of general-purpose programming languages. However, LLMs frequently generate code with typing errors, which are beyond the domain of syntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge, we introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems to guide code generation. For this purpose, we develop novel prefix automata and a search over inhabitable types, forming a sound approach to enforce well-typedness on LLM-generated code. We formalize our approach on a foundational simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate practicality. Our evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP datasets shows that our approach reduces compilation errors by more than half and significantly increases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair tasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including state-of-the-art open-weight models with more than 30B parameters. The results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach in constraining LLM code generation with formal rules of type systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeMixBench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Code Generation with Code-Mixed Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05063v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code generation tasks, powering various applications like code completion, debugging, and programming assistance. However, existing benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish (Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

The Program Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to model task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a novel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a Hopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and precedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks inherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent schedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy function differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends the Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on synthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the viability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal constraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models offer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling under uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based applications that the modern AI systems are being built upon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smaller but Better: Self-Paced Knowledge Distillation for Lightweight yet Effective LCMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03680v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large code models (LCMs) have remarkably advanced the field of code generation. Despite their impressive capabilities, they still face practical deployment issues, such as high inference costs, limited accessibility of proprietary LCMs, and adaptability issues of ultra-large LCMs. These issues highlight the critical need for more accessible, lightweight yet effective LCMs. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, which transfers the programming capabilities of larger, advanced LCMs to smaller, less powerful LCMs. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Paced knOwledge DistillAtion framework, named SODA, aiming at developing lightweight yet effective student LCMs. SODA consists of three stages in one cycle: (1) Correct-and-Fault Knowledge Delivery stage aims at improving the student models capability to recognize errors while ensuring its basic programming skill during the knowledge transferring, which involves correctness-aware supervised learning and fault-aware contrastive learning methods. (2) Multi-View Feedback stage aims at measuring the quality of results generated by the student model from two views, including model-based and static tool-based measurement, for identifying the difficult questions. (3) Feedback-based Knowledge Update stage aims at updating the student model adaptively by generating new questions at different difficulty levels, in which the difficulty levels are categorized based on the feedback in the second stage. Experimental results show that SODA improves the student model by 65.96% in terms of average Pass@1, outperforming the best baseline by 29.85%. Based on the SODA framework, we develop SodaCoder, a series of lightweight yet effective LCMs, which outperform 15 LCMs with less than or equal to 16B parameters. Notably, SodaCoder-DS-6.7B, built on DeepseekCoder-6.7B, even surpasses the prominent ChatGPT on average Pass@1.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 |

However, the dynamic topologies hinder the efficient long-term joint power and antenna array resource allocation for THz links among UAVs. Furthermore, the continuous nature of power and the discrete nature of antennas cause this joint resource allocation problem to be a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-convexity and NP-hardness. Inspired by recent rapid advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a graph neural network (GNN) aided DRL algorithm for resource allocation in the dynamic THz UAV network with an emphasis on self-node features (GLOVE) is proposed in this paper, with the aim of resource efficiency (RE) maximization. When training the allocation policy for each UAV, GLOVE learns the relationship between this UAV and its neighboring UAVs via GNN, while also emphasizing the important self-node features of this UAV. In addition, a multi-task structure is leveraged by GLOVE to cooperatively train resource allocation decisions for the power and sub-arrays of all UAVs. Experimental results illustrate that GLOVE outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the highest RE and the lowest latency. Moreover, unlike the benchmark methods with severe packet loss, GLOVE maintains zero packet loss during the entire training process, demonstrating its better robustness under the highly dynamic THz UAV network.</p></details> |  |

However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens. The code and data are available at https://github.com/solitaryzero/CoTs_are_Variables.</p></details> |  |

However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise gradient descent training dynamics for finite-width multi-layer neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04898v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we provide the first precise distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates for general multi-layer neural networks under the canonical single-index regression model, in the `finite-width proportional regime' where the sample size and feature dimension grow proportionally while the network width and depth remain bounded. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration in deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features. Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF) theories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects. First, our theory operates in the finite-width regime whereas these existing theories are fundamentally infinite-width. Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from individual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF are either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies on special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both training and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks beyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study generalization almost exclusively in two-layer settings. As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be augmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each iteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning. As a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model misspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure of a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear combination of the true signal and the initialization.</p></details> |  |

Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.</p></details> |  |

With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs. However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations. First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages. Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues. Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues. In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain. OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues. Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images. The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information. Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ISSTA'25</p></details> |

The first is a generalization of tree bootstrapping (tree learning): it is adapted to the context of reinforcement learning without knowledge based on non-linear functions. With this technique, no information is lost during the reinforcement learning process. The second is a modification of minimax with unbounded depth extending the best sequences of actions to the terminal states. This modified search is intended to be used during the learning process. The third is to replace the classic gain of a game (+1 / -1) with a reinforcement heuristic. We study particular reinforcement heuristics such as: quick wins and slow defeats ; scoring ; mobility or presence. The four is a new action selection distribution. The conducted experiments suggest that these techniques improve the level of play. Finally, we apply these different techniques to design program-players to the game of Hex (size 11 and 13) surpassing the level of Mohex 3HNN with reinforcement learning from self-play without knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the challenge of designing algorithms that leverage off-policy data while maintaining on-policy exploration, we propose PGDA-RL, a novel primal-dual Projected Gradient Descent-Ascent algorithm for solving regularized Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). PGDA-RL integrates experience replay-based gradient estimation with a two-timescale decomposition of the underlying nested optimization problem. The algorithm operates asynchronously, interacts with the environment through a single trajectory of correlated data, and updates its policy online in response to the dual variable associated with the occupation measure of the underlying MDP. We prove that PGDA-RL converges almost surely to the optimal value function and policy of the regularized MDP. Our convergence analysis relies on tools from stochastic approximation theory and holds under weaker assumptions than those required by existing primal-dual RL approaches, notably removing the need for a simulator or a fixed behavioral policy.</p></details> | 35 pages, 1 figure |

However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Checkification: A Practical Approach for Testing Static Analysis Truths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12093v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis is an essential component of many modern software development tools. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing complexity of static analyzers makes their coding error-prone. Even analysis tools based on rigorous mathematical techniques, such as abstract interpretation, are not immune to bugs. Ensuring the correctness and reliability of software analyzers is critical if they are to be inserted in production compilers and development environments. While compiler validation has seen notable success, formal validation of static analysis tools remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for testing abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Broadly, it consists in checking, over a suite of benchmarks, that the properties inferred statically are satisfied dynamically. The main advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity, which stems directly from framing it within the Ciao assertion-based validation framework, and its blended static/dynamic assertion checking approach. We demonstrate that in this setting, the analysis can be tested with little effort by combining the following components already present in the framework: 1) the static analyzer, which outputs its results as the original program source with assertions interspersed; 2) the assertion run-time checking mechanism, which instruments a program to ensure that no assertion is violated at run time; 3) the random test case generator, which generates random test cases satisfying the properties present in assertion preconditions; and 4) the unit-test framework, which executes those test cases. We have applied our approach to the CiaoPP static analyzer, resulting in the identification of many bugs with reasonable overhead. Most of these bugs have been either fixed or confirmed, helping us detect a range of errors not only related to analysis soundness but also within other aspects of the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

Typically, the performance of LLMs is measured on benchmarks with small or medium-sized context windows of thousands of lines of code. At the same time, in real-world software projects, repositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by contributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The benchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large repositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of functions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies, docstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper presents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at function body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not covered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large repositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC. Third, we contribute a scalable evaluation pipeline for efficient computing of the target metrics and a tool for visual analysis of generated code. Overall, these three aspects allow for evaluating code generation in large repositories in C and C++.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at LLM4Code 2025 Workshop co-located wtih ICSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Defect Taxonomy for Infrastructure as Code: A Replication Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01568v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: As Infrastructure as Code (IaC) becomes standard practice, ensuring the reliability of IaC scripts is essential. Defect taxonomies are valuable tools for this, offering a common language for issues and enabling systematic tracking. A significant prior study developed such a taxonomy, but based it exclusively on the declarative language Puppet. It remained unknown whether this taxonomy applies to programming language-based IaC (PL-IaC) tools like Pulumi, Terraform CDK, and AWS CDK. Aim: We replicated this foundational work to assess the generalizability of the taxonomy across a broader and more diverse landscape. Method: We performed qualitative analysis on 3,364 defect-related commits from 285 open-source PL-IaC repositories (PIPr dataset) to derive a PL-IaC-specific defect taxonomy. We then enhanced the ACID tool, originally developed for the prior study, to automatically classify and analyze defect distributions across an expanded dataset-447 open-source repositories and 94 proprietary projects from VTEX (e-commerce) and Nubank (financial). Results: Our research confirmed the same eight defect categories identified in the original study, with idempotency and security defects appearing infrequently but persistently across projects. Configuration Data defects maintain high frequency in both open-source and proprietary codebases. Conclusions: Our replication supports the generalizability of the original taxonomy, suggesting IaC development challenges surpass organizational boundaries. Configuration Data defects emerge as a persistent high-frequency problem, while idempotency and security defects remain important concerns despite lower frequency. These patterns appear consistent across open-source and proprietary projects, indicating they are fundamental to the IaC paradigm itself, transcending specific tools or project types.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

This article explores the evolution of website information security, examining its historical development, current practices, and future directions. The early beginnings from the 1960s to the 1980s laid the groundwork for modern cybersecurity, with the development of ARPANET, TCP/IP, public-key cryptography, and the first antivirus programs. The 1990s marked a transformative era, driven by the commercialization of the Internet and the emergence of web-based services. As the Internet grew, so did the range and sophistication of cyber threats, leading to advancements in security technologies such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, password protection, and firewalls. Current practices in website information security involve a multi-layered approach, including encryption, secure coding practices, regular security audits, and user education. The future of website information security is expected to be shaped by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing, as well as the increasing importance of international cooperation and standardization efforts. As cyber threats continue to evolve, ongoing research and innovation in website information security will be essential to protect sensitive information and maintain trust in the digital world.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[LLM Code Customization with Visual Results: A Benchmark on TikZ](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04670v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of AI-based code generation, customizing existing code out of natural language instructions to modify visual results -such as figures or images -has become possible, promising to reduce the need for deep programming expertise. However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeBC: A More Secure Large Language Model for Smart Contract Code Generation in Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21043v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language instructions, yet they often lack an understanding of security vulnerabilities. This limitation makes it difficult for LLMs to avoid security risks in generated code, particularly in high-security programming tasks such as smart contract development for blockchain. Researchers have attempted to enhance the vulnerability awareness of these models by training them to differentiate between vulnerable and fixed code snippets. However, this approach relies heavily on manually labeled vulnerability data, which is only available for popular languages like Python and C++. For low-resource languages like Solidity, used in smart contracts, large-scale annotated datasets are scarce and difficult to obtain. To address this challenge, we introduce CodeBC, a code generation model specifically designed for generating secure smart contracts in blockchain. CodeBC employs a three-stage fine-tuning approach based on CodeLlama, distinguishing itself from previous methods by not relying on pairwise vulnerability location annotations. Instead, it leverages vulnerability and security tags to teach the model the differences between vulnerable and secure code. During the inference phase, the model leverages security tags to generate secure and robust code. Experimental results demonstrate that CodeBC outperforms baseline models in terms of BLEU, CodeBLEU, and compilation pass rates, while significantly reducing vulnerability rates. These findings validate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our three-stage fine-tuning strategy, making CodeBC a promising solution for generating secure smart contract code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning based convex approximation for constrained parametric optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04037v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an input convex neural network (ICNN)-based self-supervised learning framework to solve continuous constrained optimization problems. By integrating the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) with the constraint correction mechanism, our framework ensures \emph{non-strict constraint feasibility}, \emph{better optimality gap}, and \emph{best convergence rate} with respect to the state-of-the-art learning-based methods. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis, showing that the algorithm converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original problem even when the internal solver is a neural network, and the approximation error is bounded. We test our approach on a range of benchmark tasks including quadratic programming (QP), nonconvex programming, and large-scale AC optimal power flow problems. The results demonstrate that compared to existing solvers (e.g., \texttt{OSQP}, \texttt{IPOPT}) and the latest learning-based methods (e.g., DC3, PDL), our approach achieves a superior balance among accuracy, feasibility, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[QbC: Quantum Correctness by Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15641v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thanks to the rapid progress and growing complexity of quantum algorithms, correctness of quantum programs has become a major concern. Pioneering research over the past years has proposed various approaches to formally verify quantum programs using proof systems such as quantum Hoare logic. All these prior approaches are post-hoc: one first implements a program and only then verifies its correctness. Here we propose Quantum Correctness by Construction (QbC): an approach to constructing quantum programs from their specification in a way that ensures correctness. We use pre- and postconditions to specify program properties, and propose sound and complete refinement rules for constructing programs in a quantum while language from their specification. We validate QbC by constructing quantum programs for idiomatic problems and patterns. We find that the approach naturally suggests how to derive program details, highlighting key design choices along the way. As such, we believe that QbC can play a role in supporting the design and taxonomization of quantum algorithms and software.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3. 4...</summary><p>v3. 43 pages, latest author version, to appear at OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Graphical Global Optimization Framework for Parameter Estimation of Statistical Models with Nonconvex Regularization Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03899v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization problems with norm-bounding constraints arise in a variety of applications, including portfolio optimization, machine learning, and feature selection. A common approach to these problems involves relaxing the norm constraint via Lagrangian relaxation, transforming it into a regularization term in the objective function. A particularly challenging class includes the zero-norm function, which promotes sparsity in statistical parameter estimation. Most existing exact methods for solving these problems introduce binary variables and artificial bounds to reformulate them as higher-dimensional mixed-integer programs, solvable by standard solvers. Other exact approaches exploit specific structural properties of the objective, making them difficult to generalize across different problem types. Alternative methods employ nonconvex penalties with favorable statistical characteristics, but these are typically addressed using heuristic or local optimization techniques due to their structural complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method to globally solve optimization problems involving generalized norm-bounding constraints. Our approach encompasses standard $\ell_p$-norms for $p \in [0, \infty)$ and nonconvex penalties such as SCAD and MCP. We leverage decision diagrams to construct strong convex relaxations directly in the original variable space, eliminating the need for auxiliary variables or artificial bounds. Integrated into a spatial branch-and-cut framework, our method guarantees convergence to the global optimum. We demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary computational experiments on benchmark sparse linear regression problems involving complex nonconvex penalties, which are not tractable using existing global optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scratch Copilot: Supporting Youth Creative Coding with AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03867v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creative coding platforms like Scratch have democratized programming for children, yet translating imaginative ideas into functional code remains a significant hurdle for many young learners. While AI copilots assist adult programmers, few tools target children in block-based environments. Building on prior research \cite{druga_how_2021,druga2023ai, druga2023scratch}, we present Cognimates Scratch Copilot: an AI-powered assistant integrated into a Scratch-like environment, providing real-time support for ideation, code generation, debugging, and asset creation. This paper details the system architecture and findings from an exploratory qualitative evaluation with 18 international children (ages 7--12). Our analysis reveals how the AI Copilot supported key creative coding processes, particularly aiding ideation and debugging. Crucially, it also highlights how children actively negotiated the use of AI, demonstrating strong agency by adapting or rejecting suggestions to maintain creative control. Interactions surfaced design tensions between providing helpful scaffolding and fostering independent problem-solving, as well as learning opportunities arising from navigating AI limitations and errors. Findings indicate Cognimates Scratch Copilot's potential to enhance creative self-efficacy and engagement. Based on these insights, we propose initial design guidelines for AI coding assistants that prioritize youth agency and critical interaction alongside supportive scaffolding.</p></details> | 5 figures, 14 pages |

Goal: To explore the challenges that women face across three different life stages, beginning as high school students, continuing as university undergraduates, and extending into their professional lives, as well as potential solutions to address these challenges. Research Method: We conducted a literature review followed by workshops to understand the perspectives of high school women, undergraduates, and practitioners regarding the same set of challenges and solutions identified in the literature. Results: Regardless of the life stage, women feel discouraged in a toxic environment often characterized by a lack of inclusion, harassment, and the exhausting need to prove themselves. We also discovered that some challenges are specific to certain life stages; for example, issues related to maternity were mentioned only by practitioners. Conclusions: Gender-related challenges arise before women enter the software development field when the proportion of men and women is still similar. While the need to prove themselves is mentioned at all three stages, high school women's challenges are more often directed toward convincing their parents that they are mature enough to handle their responsibilities. As they progress, the emphasis shifts to proving their competence in managing responsibilities for which they have received training. Increasing the inclusion of women in the field should, therefore, start earlier, and profound societal changes may be necessary to boost women's participation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, published at the International Conference on Software Engineering 2025 (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |

Our method leverages a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) based on Event Calculus (EC) to generate \emph{persistent} (i.e., constant) macro-actions, which guide Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based POMDP solvers over a time horizon, significantly reducing inference time while ensuring robust performance. Such macro-actions are learnt via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) from a few traces of execution (belief-action pairs), thus eliminating the need for manually designed heuristics and requiring only the specification of the POMDP transition model. In the Pocman and Rocksample benchmark scenarios, our learned macro-actions demonstrate increased expressiveness and generality when compared to time-independent heuristics, indeed offering substantial computational efficiency improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 9th Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning</p></details> |

We introduce an algorithm for computing underapproximate backward reachable sets of nonlinear discrete time neural feedback loops. We then use the backward reachable sets to check goal-reaching properties. Our algorithm is based on overapproximating the system dynamics function to enable computation of underapproximate backward reachable sets through solutions of mixed-integer linear programs. We rigorously analyze the soundness of our algorithm and demonstrate it on a numerical example. Our work expands the class of properties that can be verified for learning-enabled systems.</p></details> |  |

The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, resulting in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE solver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to PeNODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized, open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a Van-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, and generalization with smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a planned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural DAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, submitted to 16th International Modelica & FMI Conference</p></details> |

Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) 2025</p></details> |

Various methods exist to address the problem of SR, often based on genetic programming. However, these methods are usually complicated and involve various hyperparameters. In this paper, we present our new approach ParFam that utilizes parametric families of suitable symbolic functions to translate the discrete symbolic regression problem into a continuous one, resulting in a more straightforward setup compared to current state-of-the-art methods. In combination with a global optimizer, this approach results in a highly effective method to tackle the problem of SR. We theoretically analyze the expressivity of ParFam and demonstrate its performance with extensive numerical experiments based on the common SR benchmark suit SRBench, showing that we achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we present an extension incorporating a pre-trained transformer network DL-ParFam to guide ParFam, accelerating the optimization process by up to two magnitudes.

To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench, a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities. RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly. Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50% pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20 families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with human assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Art of Repair: Optimizing Iterative Program Repair with Instruction-Tuned Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02931v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic program repair (APR) aims to reduce the manual efforts required to identify and fix errors in source code. Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs. We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J. Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the research track of the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, T\"urkiye</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Attributed Patch Semantic Graph for Automated Patch Correctness Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02629v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) aims to automatically repair program errors without human intervention, and recent years have witnessed a growing interest on this research topic. While much progress has been made and techniques originating from different disciplines have been proposed, APR techniques generally suffer from the patch overfitting issue, i.e., the generated patches are not genuinely correct despite they pass the employed tests. To alleviate this issue, many research efforts have been devoted for automated patch correctness assessment (APCA). In particular, with the emergence of large language model (LLM) technology, researchers have employed LLM to assess the patch correctness and have obtained the state-of-the-art performance. The literature on APCA has demonstrated the importance of capturing patch semantic and explicitly considering certain code attributes in predicting patch correctness. However, existing LLM-based methods typically treat code as token sequences and ignore the inherent formal structure for code, making it difficult to capture the deep patch semantics. Moreover, these LLM-based methods also do not explicitly account for enough code attributes. To overcome these drawbacks, we in this paper design a novel patch graph representation named attributed patch semantic graph (APSG), which adequately captures the patch semantic and explicitly reflects important patch attributes. To effectively use graph information in APSG, we accordingly propose a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method of LLMs named Graph-LoRA. Extensive evaluations have been conducted to evaluate our method, and the results show that compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves accuracy and F1 score by 2.3% to 6.6% and 1.8% to 6.1% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

To the success of system design automation, there is still a lack of systematic and formal design process because an entire design process, from a system's specification to its implementation, has to deal with inherent concerns about the systems' different aspects and, consequently, inherent semantic gaps. These gaps make it hard for a design process to be traceable or transparent. Particularly, guaranteeing the correctness of produced implementations becomes the main challenge for a system design process. SynQ (Synchronous system design with Quantitative types) is an embedded domain specification language (EDSL) targeting the design of systems obeying the perfect synchrony hypothesis. SynQ is based on a component-based design framework and, by design, facilitates semantic coherency by leveraging the quantitative type theory (QTT) and language embedding. SynQ enables a semantically coherent design process, including formal specification and verification, modelling, simulation and code generation. This paper presents SynQ and its underlying formalism and demonstrates its features and potential for semantically coherent system design through a case study.</p></details> | 45 pages, 15 figures |

However, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms. We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open source. The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable, facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Column Generation and Large Neighborhood Search for Bus Driver Scheduling with Complex Break Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02485v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bus Driver Scheduling Problem (BDSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem with the goal to design shifts to cover prearranged bus tours. The objective takes into account the operational cost as well as the satisfaction of drivers. This problem is heavily constrained due to strict legal rules and collective agreements. The objective of this article is to provide state-of-the-art exact and hybrid solution methods that can provide high-quality solutions for instances of different sizes. This work presents a comprehensive study of both an exact method, Branch and Price (B&P), as well as a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework which uses B&P or Column Generation (CG) for the repair phase to solve the BDSP. It further proposes and evaluates a novel deeper integration of B&P and LNS, storing the generated columns from the LNS subproblems and reusing them for other subproblems, or to find better global solutions. The article presents a detailed analysis of several components of the solution methods and their impact, including general improvements for the B&P subproblem, which is a high-dimensional Resource Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), and the components of the LNS. The evaluation shows that our approach provides new state-of-the-art results for instances of all sizes, including exact solutions for small instances, and low gaps to a known lower bound for mid-sized instances. Conclusions: We observe that B&P provides the best results for small instances, while the tight integration of LNS and CG can provide high-quality solutions for larger instances, further improving over LNS which just uses CG as a black box. The proposed methods are general and can also be applied to other rule sets and related optimization problems</p></details> |  |

We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>27pag...</summary><p>27pages(including appendix), 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[RouthSearch: Inferring PID Parameter Specification for Flight Control Program by Coordinate Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02357v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight control programs use PID control modules with user-configurable Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D) parameters to manage UAV flying behaviors. Users can adjust these PID parameters during flight. However, flight control programs lack sufficient safety checks on user-provided PID parameters, leading to a severe UAV vulnerability - the input validation bug. This occurs when a user misconfigures PID parameters, causing dangerous states like deviation from the expected path, loss of control, or crash. Prior works use random testing like fuzzing, but these are not effective in the three-dimensional search space of PID parameters. The expensive dynamic execution of UAV tests further hinders random testing performance. We address PID parameter misconfiguration by combining the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion with coordinate search, introducing RouthSearch. Instead of ad-hoc identification, RouthSearch principledly determines valid ranges for three-dimensional PID parameters. We first leverage the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion to identify a theoretical PID parameter boundary, then refine it using efficient coordinate search. The determined valid range can filter misconfigured PID parameters from users during flight and help discover logical bugs in flight control programs. We evaluated RouthSearch across eight flight modes in PX4 and Ardupilot. Results show RouthSearch determines valid ranges with 92.0% accuracy compared to ground truth. RouthSearch discovers 3,853 PID misconfigurations within 48 hours, while the STOA work PGFuzz discovers only 449 sets, significantly outperforming prior works by 8.58 times. Our method also helped detect three bugs in ArduPilot and PX4.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34rd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce srcVul, a scalable, precise detection approach that combines program slicing with Locality-Sensitive Hashing to identify vulnerable code clones and recommend patches. srcVul builds a database of vulnerability-related slices by analyzing known vulnerable programs and their corresponding patches, indexing each slice's unique structural characteristics as a vulnerability slicing vector. During clone detection, srcVul efficiently matches slicing vectors from target programs with those in the database, recommending patches upon identifying similarities. Our evaluation of srcVul against three state-of-the-art vulnerable clone detectors demonstrates its accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, achieving 91% precision and 75% recall on established vulnerability databases and open-source repositories. These results highlight srcVul's effectiveness in detecting complex vulnerability patterns across diverse codebases.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on the Performance and Energy Usage of Compiled Python Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02346v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Python is a popular programming language known for its ease of learning and extensive libraries. However, concerns about performance and energy consumption have led to the development of compilers to enhance Python code efficiency. Despite the proven benefits of existing compilers on the efficiency of Python code, there is limited analysis comparing their performance and energy efficiency, particularly considering code characteristics and factors like CPU frequency and core count. Our study investigates how compilation impacts the performance and energy consumption of Python code, using seven benchmarks compiled with eight different tools: PyPy, Numba, Nuitka, Mypyc, Codon, Cython, Pyston-lite, and the experimental Python 3.13 version, compared to CPython. The benchmarks are single-threaded and executed on an NUC and a server, measuring energy usage, execution time, memory usage, and Last-Level Cache (LLC) miss rates at a fixed frequency and on a single core. The results show that compilation can significantly enhance execution time, energy and memory usage, with Codon, PyPy, and Numba achieving over 90\% speed and energy improvements. Nuitka optimizes memory usage consistently on both testbeds. The impact of compilation on LLC miss rate is not clear since it varies considerably across benchmarks for each compiler. Our study is important for researchers and practitioners focused on improving Python code performance and energy efficiency. We outline future research directions, such as exploring caching effects on energy usage. Our findings help practitioners choose the best compiler based on their efficiency benefits and accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Predictive Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07407v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose conformal predictive programming (CPP), a framework to solve chance constrained optimization problems, i.e., optimization problems with constraints that are functions of random variables. CPP utilizes samples from these random variables along with the quantile lemma - central to conformal prediction - to transform the chance constrained optimization problem into a deterministic problem with a quantile reformulation. CPP inherits a priori guarantees on constraint satisfaction from existing sample average approximation approaches for a class of chance constrained optimization problems, and it provides a posteriori guarantees that are of conditional and marginal nature otherwise. The strength of CPP is that it can easily support different variants of conformal prediction which have been (or will be) proposed within the conformal prediction community. To illustrate this, we present robust CPP to deal with distribution shifts in the random variables and Mondrian CPP to deal with class conditional chance constraints. To enable tractable solutions to the quantile reformulation, we present a mixed integer programming method (CPP-MIP) encoding, a bilevel optimization strategy (CPP-Bilevel), and a sampling-and-discarding optimization strategy (CPP-Discarding). We also extend CPP to deal with joint chance constrained optimization (JCCO). In a series of case studies, we show the validity of the aforementioned approaches, empirically compare CPP-MIP, CPP-Bilevel, as well as CPP-Discarding, and illustrate the advantage of CPP as compared to scenario approach.</p></details> |  |

While there are many approaches to approximately solving POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular, we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.</p></details> |  |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that generates energy-efficient parallel code on a target parallel system for a given parallel code as input. Through a multi-stage, iterative pipeline process, LASSI-EE achieved an average energy reduction of 47% across 85% of the 20 HeCBench benchmarks tested on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Our findings demonstrate the broader potential of LLMs, not only for generating correct code but also for enabling energy-aware programming. We also address key insights and limitations within the framework, offering valuable guidance for future improvements.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable insights into effective fantasy football strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, in many healthcare and recommendation applications, agents have private profiles and may misreport their contexts to gain from the system. For example, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruit volunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based on volunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participants may misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceived suboptimal treatments. We are the first to study this issue of private context misreporting in a stochastic contextual bandit game between the system and non-repeated agents. We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such as UCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reporting and can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthful algorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incur sublinear but high regret. We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program to ensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yielding an $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret. Our numerical experiments further demonstrate strong performance in multiple contexts and across other distribution families.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

An attractive solution to relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question. We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely, we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation, efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to OSDI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing LLM Code Generation: A Systematic Evaluation of Multi-Agent Collaboration and Runtime Debugging for Improved Accuracy, Reliability, and Latency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02133v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models (LLMs) for automated code generation has emerged as a significant focus within AI research. As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAIL: Graph Edit Distance and Node Alignment Using LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02124v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a widely used metric for measuring similarity between two graphs. Computing the optimal GED is NP-hard, leading to the development of various neural and non-neural heuristics. While neural methods have achieved improved approximation quality compared to non-neural approaches, they face significant challenges: (1) They require large amounts of ground truth data, which is itself NP-hard to compute. (2) They operate as black boxes, offering limited interpretability. (3) They lack cross-domain generalization, necessitating expensive retraining for each new dataset. We address these limitations with GRAIL, introducing a paradigm shift in this domain. Instead of training a neural model to predict GED, GRAIL employs a novel combination of large language models (LLMs) and automated prompt tuning to generate a program that is used to compute GED. This shift from predicting GED to generating programs imparts various advantages, including end-to-end interpretability and an autonomous self-evolutionary learning mechanism without ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments on seven datasets confirm that GRAIL not only surpasses state-of-the-art GED approximation methods in prediction quality but also achieves robust cross-domain generalization across diverse graph distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Based Cost-Effective Evaluation and Operation of ChatGPT as a Computer Programming Teaching Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17176v3)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dream of achieving a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 is closer than ever thanks to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRANE: Reasoning with constrained LLM generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09061v3)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct. Constrained LLM generation is a promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and benchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up to 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic reasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

This approach, which is known as constraint learning, faces the challenge that optimization models with neural network surrogates are harder to solve. Such difficulties have motivated studies on model reformulation, specialized optimization algorithms, and - to a lesser extent - pruning of the embedded networks. In this work, we double down on the use of surrogates by applying network pruning to produce a surrogate of the neural network itself. In the context of using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to verify neural networks, we obtained faster adversarial perturbations for dense neural networks by using sparse surrogates, especially - and surprisingly - if not taking the time to finetune the sparse network to make up for the loss in accuracy. In other words, we show that a pruned network with bad classification performance can still be a good - and more efficient - surrogate.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid growth of machine learning libraries, individuals from various fields are incorporating machine learning into their workflows through programming. However, many of these users lack software engineering experience, affecting the usability of the documentation. Traditionally, software developers have created documentation primarily for their peers, making it challenging for others to interpret and effectively use these resources. Moreover, no study has specifically focused on machine learning software documentation or analyzing the backgrounds of developers who rely on such documentation, highlighting a critical gap in understanding how to make these resources more accessible. This study examined customization trends in TensorFlow tutorials and compared these artifacts to analyze content and design differences. We also analyzed Stack Overflow questions related to TensorFlow documentation to understand the types of questions and the backgrounds of the developers asking them. Further, we developed two taxonomies based on the nature and triggers of the questions for machine learning software. Our findings showed no significant differences in the content or the nature of the questions across different tutorials. Our results show that 24.9% of the questions concern errors and exceptions, while 64.3% relate to inadequate and non-generalizable examples in the documentation. Despite efforts to create customized documentation, our analysis indicates that current TensorFlow documentation does not effectively support its target users.</p></details> | COMPSAC 2025 paper |

Many methods exist to assess confidence in ACs, including quantitative methods that represent confidence numerically. While quantitative methods are attractive in principle, existing methods suffer from issues related to interpretation, subjectivity, scalability, dialectic reasoning, and trustworthiness, which have limited their adoption. This paper introduces Certus, a domain specific language for quantitative confidence assessment. In Certus, users describe their confidence with fuzzy sets, which allow them to represent their judgment using vague, but linguistically meaningful terminology. Certus includes syntax to specify confidence propagation using expressions that can be easily inspected by users. To demonstrate the concept of the language, Certus is applied to a worked example from the automotive domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Previous studies use numerical solvers or ML-based surrogate models for these simulations. However, multiphysics simulations typically require integrating multiple specialized solvers-each for a specific physical process-into a coupled program, which introduces significant development challenges. Furthermore, existing numerical algorithms struggle with highly complex large-scale structures in multi-component simulations. Here we propose compositional Multiphysics and Multi-component PDE Simulation with Diffusion models (M2PDE) to overcome these challenges. During diffusion-based training, M2PDE learns energy functions modeling the conditional probability of one physical process/component conditioned on other processes/components. In inference, M2PDE generates coupled multiphysics and multi-component solutions by sampling from the joint probability distribution. We evaluate M2PDE on two multiphysics tasks-reaction-diffusion and nuclear thermal coupling-where it achieves more accurate predictions than surrogate models in challenging scenarios. We then apply it to a multi-component prismatic fuel element problem, demonstrating that M2PDE scales from single-component training to a 64-component structure and outperforms existing domain-decomposition and graph-based approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/M2PDE.</p></details> | 28pages,14 figures |

The product of these decisions forms a search space of programs which is typically intractably large. Existing approaches (e.g., auto-schedulers) often address this problem by sampling this space heuristically. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic-programming-based approach to explore more of the search space by iteratively decomposing large program specifications into smaller specifications reachable from a set of rewrites, then composing a final program from each rewrite that minimizes an affine cost model. To reduce memory requirements, we employ a novel memoization table representation, which indexes specifications by coordinates in $Z_{\geq 0}$ and compresses identical, adjacent solutions. This approach can visit a much larger set of programs than prior work. To evaluate the approach, we developed Morello, a compiler which lowers specifications roughly equivalent to a few-node XLA computation graph to x86. Notably, we found that an affine cost model is sufficient to surface high-throughput programs. For example, Morello synthesized a collection of matrix multiplication benchmarks targeting a Zen 1 CPU, including a 1x2048x16384, bfloat16-to-float32 vector-matrix multiply, which was integrated into Google's gemma.cpp.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Program Semantic Inequivalence Game with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03818v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on everyday coding tasks, but they can fail on complex tasks that require non-trivial reasoning about program semantics. Finding training examples to teach LLMs to solve these tasks can be challenging. In this work, we explore a method to synthetically generate code reasoning training data based on a semantic inequivalence game SInQ: a generator agent creates program variants that are semantically distinct, derived from a dataset of real-world programming tasks, while an evaluator agent has to identify input examples that cause the original programs and the generated variants to diverge in their behaviour, with the agents training each other semi-adversarially. We prove that this setup enables theoretically unlimited improvement through self-play in the limit of infinite computational resources. We evaluated our approach on multiple code generation and understanding benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection (Lu et al., 2021), where our method improves vulnerability detection in C/C++ code despite being trained exclusively on Python code, and the challenging Python builtin identifier swap benchmark (Miceli-Barone et al., 2023), showing that whereas modern LLMs still struggle with this benchmark, our approach yields substantial improvements. We release the code needed to replicate the experiments, as well as the generated synthetic data, which can be used to fine-tune LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In Brazil, women represent less than 18% of ICT students in higher education. Prior studies highlight gender-related barriers that discourage women from staying in ICT. However, they provide limited insights into their perceptions as undergraduate students and the factors influencing their participation and confidence. Goal: This study explores the perceptions of women undergraduate students in ICT regarding gender inequality. Method: A survey of 402 women from 18 Brazilian states enrolled in ICT courses was conducted using a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results: Women students reported experiencing discriminatory practices from peers and professors, both inside and outside the classroom. Gender stereotypes were found to undermine their self-confidence and self-esteem, occasionally leading to course discontinuation. Conclusions: Factors such as lack of representation, inappropriate jokes, isolation, mistrust, and difficulty being heard contribute to harmful outcomes, including reduced participation and reluctance to take leadership roles. Addressing these issues is essential to creating a safe and respectful learning environment for all students.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

| **[Global Collinearity-aware Polygonizer for Polygonal Building Mapping in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01385v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of mapping polygonal buildings from remote sensing images and introduces a novel algorithm, the Global Collinearity-aware Polygonizer (GCP). GCP, built upon an instance segmentation framework, processes binary masks produced by any instance segmentation model. The algorithm begins by collecting polylines sampled along the contours of the binary masks. These polylines undergo a refinement process using a transformer-based regression module to ensure they accurately fit the contours of the targeted building instances. Subsequently, a collinearity-aware polygon simplification module simplifies these refined polylines and generate the final polygon representation. This module employs dynamic programming technique to optimize an objective function that balances the simplicity and fidelity of the polygons, achieving globally optimal solutions. Furthermore, the optimized collinearity-aware objective is seamlessly integrated into network training, enhancing the cohesiveness of the entire pipeline. The effectiveness of GCP has been validated on two public benchmarks for polygonal building mapping. Further experiments reveal that applying the collinearity-aware polygon simplification module to arbitrary polylines, without prior knowledge, enhances accuracy over traditional methods such as the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. This finding underscores the broad applicability of GCP. The code for the proposed method will be made available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab.</p></details> |  |

These problems typically require domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1 (32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far fewer computational resources. Ablation studies further demonstrate the importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 19th Learning and Intelligent Optimization Conference (LION 19)</p></details> |

While approaches presented in the machine learning community are limited to convex or unconstrained formulations, this paper discusses the computation of solution sensitivities of general nonlinear programs (NLPs) using the implicit function theorem (IFT) and smoothed optimality conditions treated in interior-point methods (IPM). We detail sensitivity computation within a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method which employs an IPM for the quadratic subproblems. The publication is accompanied by an efficient open-source implementation within the framework, providing both forward and adjoint sensitivities for general optimal control problems, achieving speedups exceeding 3x over the state-of-the-art solver mpc.pytorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 page, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Integration of Multi-Mode Preference into Home Energy Management System Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01332v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have emerged as a pivotal tool in the smart home ecosystem, aiming to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and improve user comfort. By enabling intelligent control and optimization of household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ASME journal of engineering for sustainable buildings and cities</p></details> |
| **[Micro-Patterns in Solidity Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01282v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solidity is the predominant programming language for blockchain-based smart contracts, and its characteristics pose significant challenges for code analysis and maintenance. Traditional software analysis approaches, while effective for conventional programming languages, often fail to address Solidity-specific features such as gas optimization and security constraints. This paper introduces micro-patterns - recurring, small-scale design structures that capture key behavioral and structural peculiarities specific to a language - for Solidity language and demonstrates their value in understanding smart contract development practices. We identified 18 distinct micro-patterns organized in five categories (Security, Functional, Optimization, Interaction, and Feedback), detailing their characteristics to enable automated detection. To validate this proposal, we analyzed a dataset of 23258 smart contracts from five popular blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom and Optimism). Our analysis reveals widespread adoption of micro-patterns, with 99% of contracts implementing at least one pattern and an average of 2.76 patterns per contract. The Storage Saver pattern showed the highest adoption (84.62% mean coverage), while security patterns demonstrated platform-specific adoption rates. Statistical analysis revealed significant platform-specific differences in pattern adoption, particularly in Borrower, Implementer, and Storage Optimization patterns.</p></details> |  |

Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) is a sub-type of TD, representing specific TD instances ``openly admitted'' by the developers and often expressed through source code comments. Previous research on SATD has focused predominantly on the Java programming language, revealing a significant gap in cross-language SATD. Such a narrow focus limits the generalizability of existing findings as well as SATD detection techniques across multiple programming languages. Our work addresses such limitation by introducing CppSATD, a dedicated C++ SATD dataset, comprising over 531,000 annotated comments and their source code contexts. Our dataset can serve as a foundation for future studies that aim to develop SATD detection methods in C++, generalize the existing findings to other languages, or contribute novel insights to cross-language SATD research.</p></details> |  |

I propose to generalize RUC into a model agnostic feature optimization framework for multivariate time series forecasting. The core idea is to synthesize candidate feature programs by randomly composing operators from a domain specific grammar, score candidates rapidly with inexpensive surrogate models on rolling windows, and filter instability via nested cross validation and information theoretic shrinkage. By decoupling feature discovery from GPU heavy deep learning, the method promises faster iteration cycles, lower energy consumption, and greater interpretability. Societal relevance: accurate, transparent forecasting tools empower resource constrained institutions, energy regulators, climate risk NGOs to make data driven decisions without proprietary black box models.</p></details> |  |

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark evaluates intelligence based on minimal training requirements. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved ARC performance, they rely on extensive pre-training and high computational costs. We introduce MADIL (MDL-based AI), a novel approach leveraging the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for efficient inductive learning. MADIL performs pattern-based decomposition, enabling structured generalization. While its performance (7% at ArcPrize 2024) remains below LLM-based methods, it offers greater efficiency and interpretability. This paper details MADIL's methodology, its application to ARC, and experimental evaluations.</p></details> | 54 pages |

We introduce gadget reinforcement learning (GRL), which integrates reinforcement learning with program synthesis to automatically generate and incorporate composite gates (gadgets) into the action space. This enhances the exploration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for complex tasks like approximating ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, an NP-hard problem. We evaluate GRL using the transverse field Ising model under typical computational budgets (e.g., 2- 3 days of GPU runtime). Our results show improved accuracy, hardware compatibility and scalability. GRL exhibits robust performance as the size and complexity of the problem increases, even with constrained computational resources. By integrating gadget extraction, GRL facilitates the discovery of reusable circuit components tailored for specific hardware, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and practical implementation. This makes GRL a versatile framework for optimizing quantum circuits with applications in hardware-specific optimizations and variational quantum algorithms.

| **[Detecting the Root Cause Code Lines in Bug-Fixing Commits by Heterogeneous Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01022v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous growth in the scale and complexity of software systems, defect remediation has become increasingly difficult and costly. Automated defect prediction tools can proactively identify software changes prone to defects within software projects, thereby enhancing software development efficiency. However, existing work in heterogeneous and complex software projects continues to face challenges, such as struggling with heterogeneous commit structures and ignoring cross-line dependencies in code changes, which ultimately reduce the accuracy of defect identification. To address these challenges, we propose an approach called RC_Detector. RC_Detector comprises three main components: the bug-fixing graph construction component, the code semantic aggregation component, and the cross-line semantic retention component. The bug-fixing graph construction component identifies the code syntax structures and program dependencies within bug-fixing commits and transforms them into heterogeneous graph formats by converting the source code into vector representations. The code semantic aggregation component adapts to heterogeneous data by using heterogeneous attention to learn the hidden semantic representation of target code lines. The cross-line semantic retention component regulates propagated semantic information by using attenuation and reinforcement gates derived from old and new code semantic representations, effectively preserving cross-line semantic relationships. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our model by collecting data from 87 open-source projects, including 675 bug-fixing commits. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements of 83.15%,96.83%,78.71%,74.15%,54.14%,91.66%,91.66%, and 34.82% in MFR, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Branch-and-Bound Tree Exploration for Neural Network Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00963v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal verification is a rigorous approach that can provably ensure the quality of neural networks, and to date, Branch and Bound (BaB) is the state-of-the-art that performs verification by splitting the problem as needed and applying off-the-shelf verifiers to sub-problems for improved performance. However, existing BaB may not be efficient, due to its naive way of exploring the space of sub-problems that ignores the \emph{importance} of different sub-problems. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a notion of ``importance'' that reflects how likely a counterexample can be found with a sub-problem, and then we devise a novel verification approach, called ABONN, that explores the sub-problem space of BaB adaptively, in a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) style. The exploration is guided by the ``importance'' of different sub-problems, so it favors the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples. As soon as it finds a counterexample, it can immediately terminate; even though it cannot find, after visiting all the sub-problems, it can still manage to verify the problem. We evaluate ABONN with 552 verification problems from commonly-used datasets and neural network models, and compare it with the state-of-the-art verifiers as baseline approaches. Experimental evaluation shows that ABONN demonstrates speedups of up to $15.2\times$ on MNIST and $24.7\times$ on CIFAR-10. We further study the influences of hyperparameters to the performance of ABONN, and the effectiveness of our adaptive tree exploration.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

AI-driven tools like ChatGPT and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have enhanced learning experiences through personalisation and flexibility. ITSs can adapt to individual learning needs and provide customised feedback based on a student's performance, cognitive state, and learning path. Despite these advances, challenges remain in accommodating diverse learning styles and delivering real-time, context-aware feedback. Our research aims to address these gaps by integrating skill-aligned feedback via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs) and developing an application to enhance learning through personalised tutoring in a computer science programming context. The pilot study evaluated a proposed system using three quantitative metrics: readability score, response time, and feedback depth, across three programming tasks of varying complexity. The system successfully sorted simulated students into three skill-level categories and provided context-aware feedback. This targeted approach demonstrated better effectiveness and adaptability compared to general methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Language Perspective on the Robustness of LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19108v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have gained significant traction and popularity in recent times, extending their usage to code-generation tasks. While this field has garnered considerable attention, the exploration of testing and evaluating the robustness of code generation models remains an ongoing endeavor. Previous studies have primarily focused on code generation models specifically for the Python language, overlooking other widely used programming languages. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis to assess the robustness performance of several prominent code generation models. Furthermore, we investigate how their performance varies across different programming languages. To accomplish this, we introduce perturbations in four key areas of the prompt: DocString, function name, syntax, and format. We have compiled and released a dedicated dataset for this purpose. This work presents our experimental findings, shedding light on the performance of code generation models in various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Investigating the Importance of AB-Cycles for the State-of-the-Art TSP Heuristic EAX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00803v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Edge Assembly Crossover (EAX) algorithm is the state-of-the-art heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). It regularly outperforms other methods, such as the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun heuristic (LKH), across diverse sets of TSP instances. Essentially, EAX employs a two-stage mechanism that focuses on improving the current solutions, first, at the local and, subsequently, at the global level. Although the second phase of the algorithm has been thoroughly studied, configured, and refined in the past, in particular, its first stage has hardly been examined. In this paper, we thus focus on the first stage of EAX and introduce a novel method that quickly verifies whether the AB-cycles, generated during its internal optimization procedure, yield valid tours -- or whether they need to be repaired. Knowledge of the latter is also particularly relevant before applying other powerful crossover operators such as the Generalized Partition Crossover (GPX). Based on our insights, we propose and evaluate several improved versions of EAX. According to our benchmark study across 10 000 different TSP instances, the most promising of our proposed EAX variants demonstrates improved computational efficiency and solution quality on previously rather difficult instances compared to the current state-of-the-art EAX algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Meta-Learning via Mixed-Mode Differentiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00793v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-based bilevel optimisation is a powerful technique with applications in hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, algorithm discovery, meta-learning more broadly, and beyond. It often requires differentiating through the gradient-based optimisation process itself, leading to "gradient-of-a-gradient" calculations with computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While modern automatic differentiation libraries provide a convenient way to write programs for calculating these derivatives, they oftentimes cannot fully exploit the specific structure of these problems out-of-the-box, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we analyse such cases and propose Mixed-Flow Meta-Gradients, or MixFlow-MG -- a practical algorithm that uses mixed-mode differentiation to construct more efficient and scalable computational graphs yielding over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements over standard implementations in modern meta-learning setups.</p></details> |  |

Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows.

Within the context of physics-inspired machine learning applied to chemistry, we demonstrate the relevance of an ILP formulation to select molecular training sets for predictions of size-extensive properties. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing unsupervised training set selection approaches, especially when predicting properties of molecules larger than those present in the training set. We argue that the reason for the improved performance is due to the selection that is based on the notion of local similarity (i.e., per-atom) and a unique ILP approach that finds optimal solutions efficiently. Altogether, this work provides a practical algorithm to improve the performance of physics-inspired machine learning models and offers insights into the conceptual differences with existing training set selection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages + SI (15 pages)</p></details> |

Using two established models of reflection - Boud et al.'s Model of Reflective Process and Bain et al.'s 5R Framework for Reflection - we analyse a series of reflective assignments submitted by students over four years. Our longitudinal analysis reveals clear trends in how students' reflective abilities evolve over the course of the program. We find that more sophisticated forms of reflection, such as integration of knowledge, appropriation of skills, and reconstruction of practice, increase markedly in prevalence in later years. The complementary nature of workplace experience and university study is highlighted in students' reflections, demonstrating a key benefit of the work-based learning approach. By the final year, all students demonstrate the ability to reconstruct their experiences to inform future practice. Our findings provide insight into how reflective practice develops in Software Engineering education and suggest potential value in incorporating more structured reflection into traditional degree programs. The study also reveals instances of meta-reflection, where students reflect on the value of reflection itself, indicating a deep engagement with the reflective process. While acknowledging limitations, this work offers a unique longitudinal perspective on the development of reflective practice in work-based Software Engineering education.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Developers' Behavior Towards Privacy-Compliant Implementation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06697v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While protecting user data is essential, software developers often fail to fulfill privacy requirements. However, the reasons why they struggle with privacy-compliant implementation remain unclear. Is it due to a lack of knowledge, or is it because of insufficient support? To provide foundational insights in this field, we conducted a qualitative 5-hour programming study with 30 professional software developers implementing 3 privacy-sensitive programming tasks that were designed with GDPR compliance in mind. To explore if and how developers implement privacy requirements, participants were divided into 3 groups: control, privacy prompted, and privacy expert-supported. After task completion, we conducted follow-up interviews. Alarmingly, almost all participants submitted non-GDPR-compliant solutions (79/90). In particular, none of the 3 tasks were solved privacy-compliant by all 30 participants, with the non-prompted group having the lowest number of 3 out of 30 privacy-compliant solution attempts. Privacy prompting and expert support only slightly improved participants' submissions, with 6/30 and 8/30 privacy-compliant attempts, respectively. In fact, all participants reported severe issues addressing common privacy requirements such as purpose limitation, user consent, or data minimization. Counterintuitively, although most developers exhibited minimal confidence in their solutions, they rarely sought online assistance or contacted the privacy expert, with only 4 out of 10 expert-supported participants explicitly asking for compliance confirmation. Instead, participants often relied on existing implementations and focused on implementing functionality and security first.</p></details> |  |

While existing benchmarks evaluate the correctness and efficiency of LLM-generated code, the potential linguistic bias - where code quality varies based on the natural language used to describe programming tasks - remains underexplored. In this paper, we aim to investigate this linguistic bias through the lens of English and Chinese. To facilitate our investigation, we present a unified evaluation framework comprising a curated dataset of 52 Python programming questions with parallel bilingual task descriptions, automated correctness verification, and efficiency quantification tools based on runtime complexity estimation. Based on this framework, we conduct the first empirical study towards the linguistic bias in LLM-generated code on eight popular LCGMs, as well as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. We observe that these LCGM-generated code show different correctness on an average of 12% bilingual programming tasks, where 39% also exhibits diverse efficiency. Our findings indicate that LLMs commonly exhibit linguistic bias for code generation.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios. Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial human costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios. Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model translates into scripts using in-context learning. The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios. As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners. To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both. Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.

Information retrieval-based bug localization (IRBL) identifies buggy code based on bug reports, expediting the bug resolution process for developers. Recent years have witnessed significant achievements in IRBL, propelled by the widespread adoption of deep learning (DL). To provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art and delve into key issues, we conduct a survey encompassing 61 IRBL studies leveraging DL. We summarize best practices in each phase of the IRBL workflow, undertake a meta-analysis of prior studies, and suggest future research directions. This exploration aims to guide further advancements in the field, fostering a deeper understanding and refining practices for effective bug localization. Our study suggests that the integration of DL in IRBL enhances the model's capacity to extract semantic and syntactic information from both bug reports and source code, addressing issues such as lexical gaps, neglect of code structure information, and cold-start problems. Future research avenues for IRBL encompass exploring diversity in programming languages, adopting fine-grained granularity, and focusing on real-world applications. Most importantly, although some studies have started using large language models for IRBL, there is still a need for more in-depth exploration and thorough investigation in this area.</p></details> |  |

Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering courses at Purdue University. Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as well as qualitative narratives of student experiences. While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap" between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill development. These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 17 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |

Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 24 figures |
| **[InvAASTCluster: On Applying Invariant-Based Program Clustering to Introductory Programming Assignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14175v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the vast number of students enrolled in programming courses, there has been an increasing number of automated program repair techniques focused on introductory programming assignments (IPAs). Typically, such techniques use program clustering to take advantage of previous correct student implementations to repair a new incorrect submission. These repair techniques use clustering methods since analyzing all available correct submissions to repair a program is not feasible. However, conventional clustering methods rely on program representations based on features such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), syntax, control flow, and data flow. This paper proposes InvAASTCluster, a novel approach for program clustering that uses dynamically generated program invariants to cluster semantically equivalent IPAs. InvAASTCluster's program representation uses a combination of the program's semantics, through its invariants, and its structure through its anonymized abstract syntax tree (AASTs). Invariants denote conditions that must remain true during program execution, while AASTs are ASTs devoid of variable and function names, retaining only their types. Our experiments show that the proposed program representation outperforms syntax-based representations when clustering a set of correct IPAs. Furthermore, we integrate InvAASTCluster into a state-of-the-art clustering-based program repair tool. Our results show that InvAASTCluster advances the current state-of-the-art when used by clustering-based repair tools by repairing around 13% more students' programs, in a shorter amount of time.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 21 Figures, 5 Tables.

| **[Testing CPS with Design Assumptions-Based Metamorphic Relations and Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03330v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) software is used to enforce desired behaviours on physical systems. To test the interaction between the CPS software and the system's physics, engineers provide traces of desired physical states and observe traces of the actual physical states. CPS requirements describe how closely the actual physical traces should track the desired traces. These requirements are typically defined for specific, simple input traces such as step or ramp sequences, and thus are not applicable to arbitrary inputs. This limits the availability of oracles for CPSs. Our recent work proposes an approach to testing CPS using control-theoretical design assumptions instead of requirements. This approach circumvents the oracle problem by leveraging the control-theoretical guarantees that are provided when the design assumptions are satisfied. To address the test case generation and oracle problems, researchers have proposed metamorphic testing, which is based on the study of relations across tests, i.e., metamorphic relations (MRs). In this work, we define MRs based on the design assumptions and explore combinations of these MRs using genetic programming to generate CPS test cases. This enables the generation of CPS input traces with potentially arbitrary shapes, together with associated expected output traces. We use the deviation from the expected output traces to guide the generation of input traces that falsify the MRs. Our experiment results show that the MR-falsification provides engineers with new information, helping them identify passed and failed test cases. Furthermore, we show that the generation of traces that falsify the MRs is a non-trivial problem, which is successfully addressed by our genetic search.</p></details> |  |

Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable, state-of-the-art performance LLM execution without code changes. Focusing on flash attention -- a widespread performance-critical LLM kernel -- we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.</p></details> |  |

Despite its importance, executing the test suite of a project can be challenging in practice because different projects use different programming languages, software ecosystems, build systems, testing frameworks, and other tools. These challenges make it difficult to create a reliable, universal test execution method that works across different projects. This paper presents ExecutionAgent, an automated technique that prepares scripts for building an arbitrary project from source code and running its test cases. Inspired by the way a human developer would address this task, our approach is a large language model (LLM)-based agent that autonomously executes commands and interacts with the host system. The agent uses meta-prompting to gather guidelines on the latest technologies related to the given project, and it iteratively refines its process based on feedback from the previous steps. Our evaluation applies ExecutionAgent to 50 open-source projects that use 14 different programming languages and many different build and testing tools. The approach successfully executes the test suites of 33/50 projects, while matching the test results of ground truth test suite executions with a deviation of only 7.5%. These results improve over the best previously available technique by 6.6x. The costs imposed by the approach are reasonable, with an execution time of 74 minutes and LLM costs of USD 0.16, on average per project. We envision ExecutionAgent to serve as a valuable tool for developers, automated programming tools, and researchers that need to execute tests across a wide variety of projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>PUBLI...</summary><p>PUBLISHED AT ISSTA 2025</p></details> |

Despite bringing significant advantages, these technologies also increase system complexity and operational challenges. Traditional root cause analysis (RCA) struggles to achieve automated fault response, heavily relying on manual intervention. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made breakthroughs in contextual inference and domain knowledge integration, providing new solutions for Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps). However, Existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: text input constraints, dynamic service dependency hallucinations, and context window limitations. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data, namely TAMO, for fine-grained RCA. It unifies multi-modal observational data into time-aligned representations to extract consistent features and employs specialized root cause localization and fault classification tools for perceiving the contextual environment. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLM in handling real-time changing service dependencies and raw observational data and guides LLM to generate repair strategies aligned with system contexts by structuring key information into a prompt. Experimental results show that TAMO performs well in root cause analysis when dealing with public datasets characterized by heterogeneity and common fault types, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, "FTCT" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption for Quantum Computer Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21235v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a lattice-based scheme for homomorphic evaluation of quantum programs and proofs that remains secure against quantum adversaries. Classical homomorphic encryption is lifted to the quantum setting by replacing composite-order groups with Module Learning-With-Errors (MLWE) lattices and by generalizing polynomial functors to bounded natural super functors (BNSFs). A secret depolarizing BNSF mask hides amplitudes, while each quantum state is stored as an MLWE ciphertext pair. We formalize security with the qIND-CPA game that allows coherent access to the encryption oracle and give a four-hybrid reduction to decisional MLWE. The design also covers practical issues usually left open. A typed QC-bridge keeps classical bits produced by measurements encrypted yet still usable as controls, with weak-measurement semantics for expectation-value workloads. Encrypted Pauli twirls add circuit privacy. If a fixed knowledge base is needed, its axioms are shipped as MLWE "capsules"; the evaluator can use them but cannot read them. A rho-calculus driver schedules encrypted tasks across several QPUs and records an auditable trace on an RChain-style ledger. Performance analysis shows that the extra lattice arithmetic fits inside today's QPU idle windows: a 100-qubit, depth-10^3 teleportation-based proof runs in about 10 ms, the public key (seed only) is 32 bytes, and even a CCA-level key stays below 300 kB. A photonic Dirac-3 prototype that executes homomorphic teleportation plus knowledge-base-relative amplitude checks appears feasible with current hardware. These results indicate that fully homomorphic, knowledge-base-aware quantum reasoning is compatible with near-term quantum clouds and standard post-quantum security assumptions.</p></details> |  |

SecRepoBench has 318 code generation tasks in 27 C/C++ repositories, covering 15 CWEs. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs using our benchmark and find that the models struggle with generating correct and secure code. In addition, the performance of LLMs to generate self-contained programs as measured by prior benchmarks do not translate to comparative performance at generating secure and correct code at the repository level in SecRepoBench. We show that the state-of-the-art prompt engineering techniques become less effective when applied to the repository level secure code generation problem. We conduct extensive experiments, including an agentic technique to generate secure code, to demonstrate that our benchmark is currently the most difficult secure coding benchmark, compared to previous state-of-the-art benchmarks. Finally, our comprehensive analysis provides insights into potential directions for enhancing the ability of LLMs to generate correct and secure code in real-world repositories.</p></details> |  |

Successful attempts in prior work have conducted studies in settings where the set of published statistics is rich enough that entire datasets can be reconstructed with certainty. In our work, we instead focus on the regime where many possible datasets match the published statistics, making it impossible to reconstruct the entire private dataset perfectly (i.e., when approaches in prior work fail). We propose the problem of partial data reconstruction, in which the goal of the adversary is to instead output a $\textit{subset}$ of rows and/or columns that are $\textit{guaranteed to be correct}$. We introduce a novel integer programming approach that first $\textbf{generates}$ a set of claims and then $\textbf{verifies}$ whether each claim holds for all possible datasets consistent with the published aggregates. We evaluate our approach on the housing-level microdata from the U.S. Decennial Census release, demonstrating that privacy violations can still persist even when information published about such data is relatively sparse.</p></details> |  |

High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools have eased FPGA programming by raising the abstraction level from RTL to untimed C/C++, yet attaining high performance still demands expert knowledge and iterative manual insertion of optimization pragmas to modify the microarchitecture. To address this challenge, we propose LIFT, a large language model (LLM)-based coding assistant for HLS that automatically generates performance-critical pragmas given a C/C++ design. We fine-tune the LLM by tightly integrating and supervising the training process with a graph neural network (GNN), combining the sequential modeling capabilities of LLMs with the structural and semantic understanding of GNNs necessary for reasoning over code and its control/data dependencies. On average, LIFT produces designs that improve performance by 3.52x and 2.16x than prior state-of the art AutoDSE and HARP respectively, and 66x than GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

However, developing affective computing pipelines remains labor-intensive due to the lack of software frameworks that support multimodal, multi-domain emotion recognition applications. This often results in redundant effort when building pipelines for different applications. While recent frameworks attempt to address these challenges, they remain limited in reducing manual effort and ensuring cross-domain generalizability. We introduce AffectEval, a modular and customizable framework to facilitate the development of affective computing pipelines while reducing the manual effort and duplicate work involved in developing such pipelines. We validate AffectEval by replicating prior affective computing experiments, and we demonstrate that our framework reduces programming effort by up to 90%, as measured by the reduction in raw lines of code.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The short version is published in ACM/IEEE CHASE 2025</p></details> |

| **[Enhancing Differential Testing With LLMs For Testing Deep Learning Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07944v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by ACM TOSEM.

The absence of comprehensive best practices for feature toggle usage often results in improper implementation, causing code quality issues. Although certain feature toggle usage patterns are prone to toggle smells, there is no tool as of today for software engineers to detect toggle usage patterns from the source code. This paper presents a tool TS-Detector to detect five different toggle usage patterns across ten open-source software projects in six different programming languages. We conducted a manual evaluation and results show that the true positive rates of detecting Spread, Nested, and Dead toggles are 80%, 86.4%, and 66.6% respectively, and the true negative rate of Mixed and Enum usages was 100%. The tool can be downloaded from its GitHub repository and can be used following the instructions provided there.</p></details> | <details><summary>33rd ...</summary><p>33rd ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering, June 23--28, 2025, Trondheim, Norway</p></details> |
| **[Software Development Life Cycle Perspective: A Survey of Benchmarks for Code Large Language Models and Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05283v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To that aim, we generated a database with 996 entries, which includes up to 7 variables regarding both the manufacturing process and environmental conditions for more than 180 days. Then, we relied on a software framework that brings together a conglomeration of automated ML protocols that execute sequentially against our database by simply command-line interface. This easily permits hyper-optimizing and randomizing seeds of the ML models through exhaustive benchmarking so that optimal models are obtained. The accuracy achieved reaches values of the coefficient determination (R2) widely exceeding 0.90, whereas the root mean squared error (RMSE), sum of squared error (SSE), and mean absolute error (MAE)>1% of the target value, the PCE. Additionally, we contribute with validated models able to screen the behavior of OSCs never seen in the database. In that case, R2~0.96-0.97 and RMSE~1%, thus confirming the reliability of the proposal to predict. For comparative purposes, classical Bayesian regression fitting based on non-linear mean squares (LMS) are also presented, which only perform sufficiently for univariate cases of single OSCs. Hence they fail to outperform the breadth of the capabilities shown by the ML models. Finally, thanks to the standardized results offered by the ML framework, we study the dependencies between the variables of the dataset and their implications for the optimal performance and stability of the OSCs. Reproducibility is ensured by a standardized report altogether with the dataset, which are publicly available at Github.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.</p></details> |  |

To better communicate privacy policies for smartwatches, we need an in-depth understanding of their concepts and provide better ways to enable developers to integrate them when engineering systems. Up to now, no conceptual model exists covering privacy statements from different smartwatch manufacturers that is reusable for developers. This paper introduces such a conceptual model for privacy policies of smartwatches and shows its use in a model-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data visualization of wearable privacy policies from different smartwatch manufacturers. We have analyzed the privacy policies of various manufacturers and extracted the relevant concepts. Moreover, we have checked the model with lawyers for its correctness, instantiated it with concrete data, and used it in a model-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data visualization. This reusable privacy policy model can enable developers to easily represent privacy policies in their systems. This provides a foundation for more structured and understandable privacy policies which, in the long run, can increase the data sovereignty of application users.</p></details> |  |

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms effectively help designers identify trade-offs among the desired non-functional properties. To reduce the use of computational resources, this work examines the impact of implementing a search budget to limit the search for design alternatives. In particular, we analyze how time budgets affect the quality of Pareto fronts by utilizing quality indicators and exploring the structural features of the generated design alternatives. This study identifies distinct behavioral differences among evolutionary algorithms when a search budget is implemented. It further reveals that design alternatives generated under a budget are structurally different from those produced without one. Additionally, we offer recommendations for designers on selecting algorithms in relation to time constraints, thereby facilitating the effective application of automated refactoring to improve non-functional properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.08385</p></details> |

Beyond technical aspects, CSE also encompasses business activities like continuous planning, budgeting, and operational processes. Coordinating these activities in large-scale product development involves multiple stakeholders, increasing complexity. This study aims to address this complexity by identifying and analyzing critical dependencies in large-scale CSE. Based on 17 semi-structured interviews conducted at two Nordic fintech companies, our preliminary findings indicate that dependencies between software teams and support functions, as well as between software teams and external entities, are the primary sources of delays and bottlenecks. As a next step, we plan to further refine our understanding of critical dependencies in large-scale CSE and explore coordination mechanisms that can better support software development teams in managing these challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

Despite their impressive capabilities, they still face practical deployment issues, such as high inference costs, limited accessibility of proprietary LCMs, and adaptability issues of ultra-large LCMs. These issues highlight the critical need for more accessible, lightweight yet effective LCMs. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, which transfers the programming capabilities of larger, advanced LCMs to smaller, less powerful LCMs. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Paced knOwledge DistillAtion framework, named SODA, aiming at developing lightweight yet effective student LCMs. SODA consists of three stages in one cycle: (1) Correct-and-Fault Knowledge Delivery stage aims at improving the student models capability to recognize errors while ensuring its basic programming skill during the knowledge transferring, which involves correctness-aware supervised learning and fault-aware contrastive learning methods. (2) Multi-View Feedback stage aims at measuring the quality of results generated by the student model from two views, including model-based and static tool-based measurement, for identifying the difficult questions. (3) Feedback-based Knowledge Update stage aims at updating the student model adaptively by generating new questions at different difficulty levels, in which the difficulty levels are categorized based on the feedback in the second stage. Experimental results show that SODA improves the student model by 65.96% in terms of average Pass@1, outperforming the best baseline by 29.85%. Based on the SODA framework, we develop SodaCoder, a series of lightweight yet effective LCMs, which outperform 15 LCMs with less than or equal to 16B parameters. Notably, SodaCoder-DS-6.7B, built on DeepseekCoder-6.7B, even surpasses the prominent ChatGPT on average Pass@1.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 |

To address this challenge, we propose ReadMe$.$LLM, LLM-oriented documentation for software libraries. By attaching the contents of ReadMe$.$LLM to a query, performance consistently improves to near-perfect accuracy, with one case study demonstrating up to 100% success across all tested models. We propose a software development lifecycle where LLM-specific documentation is maintained alongside traditional software updates. In this study, we present two practical applications of the ReadMe$.$LLM idea with diverse software libraries, highlighting that our proposed approach could generalize across programming domains.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |

However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.</p></details> |  |
| **[PR2: Peephole Raw Pointer Rewriting with LLMs for Translating C to Safer Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04852v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Design Space of Lockfiles Across Package Managers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04834v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software developers reuse third-party packages that are hosted in package registries. At build time, a package manager resolves and fetches the direct and indirect dependencies of a project. Most package managers also generate a lockfile, which records the exact set of resolved dependency versions. Lockfiles are used to reduce build times; to verify the integrity of resolved packages; and to support build reproducibility across environments and time. Despite these beneficial features, developers often struggle with their maintenance, usage, and interpretation. In this study, we unveil the major challenges related to lockfiles, such that future researchers and engineers can address them. We perform the first comprehensive study of lockfiles across 7 popular package managers, npm, pnpm, Cargo, Poetry, Pipenv, Gradle, and Go. First, we highlight how the content and functions of lockfiles differ across package managers and ecosystems. Next, we conduct a qualitative analysis based on semi-structured interviews with 15 developers. We capture first-hand insights about the benefits that developers perceive in lockfiles, as well as the challenges they face to manage these files. Following these observations, we make 4 recommendations to further improve lockfiles, for a better developer experience.</p></details> |  |

However, the presence of sensitive information in these logs poses significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers that could lead to re-identification risks. While general data privacy has been extensively studied, the specific domain of privacy in software logs remains underexplored, with inconsistent definitions of sensitivity and a lack of standardized guidelines for anonymization. To mitigate this gap, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of privacy in software logs from multiple perspectives. We start by performing an analysis of 25 publicly available log datasets to identify potentially sensitive attributes. Based on the result of this step, we focus on three perspectives: privacy regulations, research literature, and industry practices. We first analyze key data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to understand the legal requirements concerning sensitive information in logs. Second, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify common privacy attributes and practices in log anonymization, revealing gaps in existing approaches. Finally, we survey 45 industry professionals to capture practical insights on log anonymization practices. Our findings shed light on various perspectives of log privacy and reveal industry challenges, such as technical and efficiency issues while highlighting the need for standardized guidelines. By combining insights from regulatory, academic, and industry perspectives, our study aims to provide a clearer framework for identifying and protecting sensitive information in software logs.</p></details> |  |

This has led to the emergence of AI for Software Engineering as a distinct research area within software engineering. With the development of quantum computing, the field of Quantum AI (QAI) is arising, enhancing the performance of classical AI and holding significant potential for solving classical software engineering problems. Some initial applications of QAI in software engineering have already emerged, such as software test optimization. However, the path ahead remains open, offering ample opportunities to solve complex software engineering problems with QAI cost-effectively. To this end, this paper presents open research opportunities and challenges in QAI for software engineering that need to be addressed.</p></details> |  |

Effectively analyzing these reviews is essential for guiding app development, prioritizing feature updates, and enhancing user satisfaction. Classifying reviews into functional and non-functional requirements play a pivotal role in distinguishing feedback related to specific app features (functional requirements) from feedback concerning broader quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability (non-functional requirements). Both categories are integral to informed development decisions. Traditional approaches to classifying app reviews are hindered by the need for large, domain-specific datasets, which are often costly and time-consuming to curate. This study explores the potential of zero-shot learning with ChatGPT for classifying app reviews into four categories: functional requirement, non-functional requirement, both, or neither. We evaluate ChatGPT's performance on a benchmark dataset of 1,880 manually annotated reviews from ten diverse apps spanning multiple domains. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT achieves a robust F1 score of 0.842 in review classification, despite certain challenges and limitations. Additionally, we examine how factors such as review readability and length impact classification accuracy and conduct a manual analysis to identify review categories more prone to misclassification.</p></details> |  |

Not only its applications have broadened to various sectors but also poses new system design and optimization opportunities. The technology is capable of understanding and responding in multiple modalities. However, the advanced capability currently comes with significant system resource demands. To sustainably scale generative AI capabilities to billions of users in the world, inference must be fast and efficient. This paper pinpoints key system design and optimization opportunities by characterizing a family of emerging multi-modal generation models on real systems. Auto-regressive token generation is a critical latency performance bottleneck, typically dominated by GPU idle time. In addition to memory-intensive attention across the generative AI models, linear operations constitute significant inference latency due to the feed forward networks in Transformer-based models. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art optimization levers, spanning from applications to system software and hardware, set a 3.88x better baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages including references. 8 Figures.

With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs. However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations. First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages. Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues. Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues. In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain. OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues. Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images. The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information. Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ISSTA'25</p></details> |

This introduces human-on-the-loop requirements, where evolving needs shape ongoing system functionality and behaviors. While traditional personas support upfront, static requirements elicitation, we propose a persona-based advocate framework for runtime requirements engineering to provide ethically informed, safety-driven, and regulatory-aware decision support. Our approach extends standard personas into event-driven personas. When triggered by events such as adverse environmental conditions, evolving mission state, or operational constraints, the framework updates the sUAS operator's view of the personas, ensuring relevance to current conditions. We create three key advocate personas, namely Safety Controller, Ethical Governor, and Regulatory Auditor, to manage trade-offs among risk, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. We perform a proof-of-concept validation in an emergency response scenario using sUAS, showing how our advocate personas provide context-aware guidance grounded in safety, regulatory, and ethical constraints. By evolving static, design-time personas into adaptive, event-driven advocates, the framework surfaces mission-critical runtime requirements in response to changing conditions. These requirements shape operator decisions in real time, aligning actions with the operational demands of the moment.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Edge-GPU Based Face Tracking for Face Detection and Recognition Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04524v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cost-effective machine vision systems dedicated to real-time and accurate face detection and recognition in public places are crucial for many modern applications. However, despite their high performance, which could be reached using specialized edge or cloud AI hardware accelerators, there is still room for improvement in throughput and power consumption. This paper aims to suggest a combined hardware-software approach that optimizes face detection and recognition systems on one of the latest edge GPUs, namely NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. First, it leverages the simultaneous usage of all its hardware engines to improve processing time. This offers an improvement over previous works where these tasks were mainly allocated automatically and exclusively to the CPU or, to a higher extent, to the GPU core. Additionally, the paper suggests integrating a face tracker module to avoid redundantly running the face recognition algorithm for every frame but only when a new face appears in the scene. The results of extended experiments suggest that simultaneous usage of all the hardware engines that are available in the Orin GPU and tracker integration into the pipeline yield an impressive throughput of 290 FPS (frames per second) on 1920 x 1080 input size frames containing in average of 6 faces/frame. Additionally, a substantial saving of power consumption of around 800 mW was achieved when compared to running the task on the CPU/GPU engines only and without integrating a tracker into the Orin GPU\'92s pipeline. This hardware-codesign approach can pave the way to design high-performance machine vision systems at the edge, critically needed in video monitoring in public places where several nearby cameras are usually deployed for a same scene.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

These models assist programmers in generating code, potentially increasing productivity and efficiency. However, the environmental impact of utilising these AI models is substantial, given their high energy consumption during both training and inference stages. This research aims to compare the energy consumption of manual software development versus an LLM-assisted approach, using Codeforces as a simulation platform for software development. The goal is to quantify the environmental impact and propose strategies for minimising the carbon footprint of using LLM in software development. Our results show that the LLM-assisted code generation leads on average to 32.72 higher carbon footprint than the manual one. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between task complexity and the difference in the carbon footprint of the two approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite their significant value, designing and managing CPI is intricate; they evolve with rapidly changing business contexts and present comprehension and explanation challenges for end-users. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) emerges as a potent solution to overcome these hurdles and ensure CPI adoption, though its application to CPI remains an understudied research area. While prior efforts targeted specific CPI modeling objectives, a comprehensive overview of literature advancements is lacking. This study addresses this gap by conducting a scoping review yielding dual outcomes: (1) a comprehensive mapping of modeling features in the literature and (2) a comparative analysis of the coverage offered by the modeling frameworks. These outcomes enhance CPI understanding in academic and practitioner circles and offer insights for future MDE CPI advancements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effectively Leveraging Execution Traces for Program Repair with Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04441v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising performance on various programming tasks, including Automatic Program Repair (APR). However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Checkification: A Practical Approach for Testing Static Analysis Truths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12093v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis is an essential component of many modern software development tools. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing complexity of static analyzers makes their coding error-prone. Even analysis tools based on rigorous mathematical techniques, such as abstract interpretation, are not immune to bugs. Ensuring the correctness and reliability of software analyzers is critical if they are to be inserted in production compilers and development environments. While compiler validation has seen notable success, formal validation of static analysis tools remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for testing abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Broadly, it consists in checking, over a suite of benchmarks, that the properties inferred statically are satisfied dynamically. The main advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity, which stems directly from framing it within the Ciao assertion-based validation framework, and its blended static/dynamic assertion checking approach. We demonstrate that in this setting, the analysis can be tested with little effort by combining the following components already present in the framework: 1) the static analyzer, which outputs its results as the original program source with assertions interspersed; 2) the assertion run-time checking mechanism, which instruments a program to ensure that no assertion is violated at run time; 3) the random test case generator, which generates random test cases satisfying the properties present in assertion preconditions; and 4) the unit-test framework, which executes those test cases. We have applied our approach to the CiaoPP static analyzer, resulting in the identification of many bugs with reasonable overhead. Most of these bugs have been either fixed or confirmed, helping us detect a range of errors not only related to analysis soundness but also within other aspects of the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

Typically, the performance of LLMs is measured on benchmarks with small or medium-sized context windows of thousands of lines of code. At the same time, in real-world software projects, repositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by contributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The benchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large repositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of functions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies, docstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper presents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at function body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not covered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large repositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC. Third, we contribute a scalable evaluation pipeline for efficient computing of the target metrics and a tool for visual analysis of generated code. Overall, these three aspects allow for evaluating code generation in large repositories in C and C++.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at LLM4Code 2025 Workshop co-located wtih ICSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Defect Taxonomy for Infrastructure as Code: A Replication Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01568v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: As Infrastructure as Code (IaC) becomes standard practice, ensuring the reliability of IaC scripts is essential. Defect taxonomies are valuable tools for this, offering a common language for issues and enabling systematic tracking. A significant prior study developed such a taxonomy, but based it exclusively on the declarative language Puppet. It remained unknown whether this taxonomy applies to programming language-based IaC (PL-IaC) tools like Pulumi, Terraform CDK, and AWS CDK. Aim: We replicated this foundational work to assess the generalizability of the taxonomy across a broader and more diverse landscape. Method: We performed qualitative analysis on 3,364 defect-related commits from 285 open-source PL-IaC repositories (PIPr dataset) to derive a PL-IaC-specific defect taxonomy. We then enhanced the ACID tool, originally developed for the prior study, to automatically classify and analyze defect distributions across an expanded dataset-447 open-source repositories and 94 proprietary projects from VTEX (e-commerce) and Nubank (financial). Results: Our research confirmed the same eight defect categories identified in the original study, with idempotency and security defects appearing infrequently but persistently across projects. Configuration Data defects maintain high frequency in both open-source and proprietary codebases. Conclusions: Our replication supports the generalizability of the original taxonomy, suggesting IaC development challenges surpass organizational boundaries. Configuration Data defects emerge as a persistent high-frequency problem, while idempotency and security defects remain important concerns despite lower frequency. These patterns appear consistent across open-source and proprietary projects, indicating they are fundamental to the IaC paradigm itself, transcending specific tools or project types.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Yes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15919v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reproducible Builds (R-B) guarantee that rebuilding a software package from source leads to bitwise identical artifacts. R-B is a promising approach to increase the integrity of the software supply chain, when installing open source software built by third parties. Unfortunately, despite success stories like high build reproducibility levels in Debian packages, uncertainty remains among field experts on the scalability of R-B to very large package repositories. In this work, we perform the first large-scale study of bitwise reproducibility, in the context of the Nix functional package manager, rebuilding 709 816 packages from historical snapshots of the nixpkgs repository, the largest cross-ecosystem open source software distribution, sampled in the period 2017-2023. We obtain very high bitwise reproducibility rates, between 69 and 91% with an upward trend, and even higher rebuildability rates, over 99%. We investigate unreproducibility causes, showing that about 15% of failures are due to embedded build dates. We release a novel dataset with all build statuses, logs, as well as full ''diffoscopes'': recursive diffs of where unreproducible build artifacts differ.</p></details> |  |

What follows is a brief description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise. The 13th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software (ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy, France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad (Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications, in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and stakeholders in education. While this volume goes to press, the next edition of the ThEdu workshop is being prepared: ThEdu'25 will be a satellite event of the 30th international Conference on Automated DEduction (CADE-30), July 28th - August 2nd, 2025, Stuttgart, Germany.</p></details> |  |

DTs can include different kinds of assets, e.g., models, data, which could potentially be reused across DT projects by multiple users, directly affecting development costs, as well as enabling collaboration and further development of these assets. To provide user support for these purposes, dedicated DT frameworks and platforms are required, that take into account user needs, providing the infrastructure and building blocks for DT development and management. In this demo paper, we show how the DT as a Service (DTaaS) platform has been extended to enable a federated approach to DT development and management, that allows multiple users across multiple instances of DTaaS to discover, reuse, reconfigure, and modify existing DT assets.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ASQAP 2025, arXiv:2505.02873</p></details> |

| **[Verification of Digital Twins using Classical and Statistical Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04322v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of digital techniques, the concept of digital twin (DT) has received a widespread attention in both industry and academia. While several definitions exist for a DT, most definitions focus on the existence of a virtual entity (VE) of a real-world object or process, often comprising interconnected models which interact with each other, undergoing changes continuously owing to the synchronization with the real-world object. These interactions might lead to inconsistencies at execution time, due to their highly stochastic and/or time-critical nature, which may lead to undesirable behavior. In addition, the continuously varying nature of VE owing to its synchronization with the real-world object further contributes to the complexity arising from these interactions and corresponding model execution times, which could possibly affect its overall functioning at runtime. This creates a need to perform (continuous) verification of the VE, to ensure that it behaves consistently at runtime by adhering to desired properties such as deadlock freeness, functional correctness, liveness and timeliness. Some critical properties such as deadlock freeness can only be verified using classical model checking; on the other hand, statistical model checking provides the possibility to model actual stochastic temporal behavior. We therefore propose to use both these techniques to verify the correctness and the fulfillment of desirable properties of VE. We present our observations and findings from applying these techniques on the DT of an autonomously driving truck. Results from these verification techniques suggest that this DT adheres to properties of deadlock freeness and functional correctness, but not adhering to timeliness properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ASQAP 2025, arXiv:2505.02873</p></details> |
| **[KERAIA: An Adaptive and Explainable Framework for Dynamic Knowledge Representation and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04313v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce KERAIA, a novel framework and software platform for symbolic knowledge engineering designed to address the persistent challenges of representing, reasoning with, and executing knowledge in dynamic, complex, and context-sensitive environments. The central research question that motivates this work is: How can unstructured, often tacit, human expertise be effectively transformed into computationally tractable algorithms that AI systems can efficiently utilise? KERAIA seeks to bridge this gap by building on foundational concepts such as Minsky's frame-based reasoning and K-lines, while introducing significant innovations. These include Clouds of Knowledge for dynamic aggregation, Dynamic Relations (DRels) for context-sensitive inheritance, explicit Lines of Thought (LoTs) for traceable reasoning, and Cloud Elaboration for adaptive knowledge transformation. This approach moves beyond the limitations of traditional, often static, knowledge representation paradigms. KERAIA is designed with Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle, ensuring transparency and interpretability, particularly through the use of LoTs. The paper details the framework's architecture, the KSYNTH representation language, and the General Purpose Paradigm Builder (GPPB) to integrate diverse inference methods within a unified structure. We validate KERAIA's versatility, expressiveness, and practical applicability through detailed analysis of multiple case studies spanning naval warfare simulation, industrial diagnostics in water treatment plants, and strategic decision-making in the game of RISK. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis against established knowledge representation paradigms (including ontologies, rule-based systems, and knowledge graphs) and discuss the implementation aspects and computational considerations of the KERAIA platform.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[How the Misuse of a Dataset Harmed Semantic Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04311v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BigCloneBench is a well-known and widely used large-scale dataset for the evaluation of recall of clone detection tools. It has been beneficial for research on clone detection and has become a standard in evaluating the performance of clone detection tools. More recently, it has also been widely used as a dataset to evaluate machine learning approaches to semantic clone detection or code similarity detection for functional or semantic similarity. This paper demonstrates that BigCloneBench is problematic to use as ground truth for learning or evaluating semantic code similarity, and highlights the aspects of BigCloneBench that affect the ground truth quality. A manual investigation of a statistically significant random sample of 406 Weak Type-3/Type-4 clone pairs revealed that 93% of them do not have a similar functionality and are therefore mislabelled. In a literature review of 179 papers that use BigCloneBench as a dataset, we found 139 papers that used BigCloneBench to evaluate semantic clone detection and where the results are threatened in their validity by the mislabelling. As such, these papers often report high F1 scores (e.g., above 0.9), which indicates overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts rather than genuine semantic similarity detection. We emphasise that using BigCloneBench remains valid for the intended purpose of evaluating syntactic or textual clone detection of Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3 clones. We acknowledge the important contributions of BigCloneBench to two decades of traditional clone detection research. However, the usage of BigCloneBench beyond the intended purpose without careful consideration of its limitations has led to misleading results and conclusions, and potentially harmed the field of semantic clone detection.</p></details> |  |

According to the results, the propagation sequences have been complex in general, although GitHub, Debian, and Ubuntu stand out. Furthermore, the associated propagation delays have been lengthy, and these do not correlate well with the number of ecosystems involved in the associated sequences. Nor does the presence or absence of particularly ecosystems in the sequences yield clear, interpretable patterns. With these results, the paper contributes to the overlapping knowledge bases about software ecosystems, traceability, and vulnerabilities.</p></details> | Submitted to ICTSS |
| **[Towards User-Centred Design of AI-Assisted Decision-Making in Law Enforcement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17393v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these systems. Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Despite their impressive adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic variations. Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To lower barriers and increase engagement, OSS projects have dedicated experts who provide guidance for newcomers. However, timely responses are often hindered by experts' busy schedules. The recent rapid advancements of AI in software engineering have brought opportunities to leverage AI as a substitute for expert mentoring. However, the potential role of AI as a comprehensive mentor throughout the entire onboarding process remains unexplored. To identify design strategies of this ``AI mentor'', we applied Design Fiction as a participatory method with 19 OSS newcomers. We investigated their current onboarding experience and elicited 32 design strategies for future AI mentor. Participants envisioned AI mentor being integrated into OSS platforms like GitHub, where it could offer assistance to newcomers, such as ``recommending projects based on personalized requirements'' and ``assessing and categorizing project issues by difficulty''. We also collected participants' perceptions of a prototype, named ``OSSerCopilot'', that implemented the envisioned strategies. They found the interface useful and user-friendly, showing a willingness to use it in the future, which suggests the design strategies are effective. Finally, in order to identify the gaps between our design strategies and current research, we conducted a comprehensive literature review, evaluating the extent of existing research support for this concept. We find that research is relatively scarce in certain areas where newcomers highly anticipate AI mentor assistance, such as ``discovering an interested project''. Our study has the potential to revolutionize the current newcomer-expert mentorship and provides valuable insights for researchers and tool designers aiming to develop and enhance AI mentor systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of compilation instruction search and error resolution makes automatic compilation challenging. Inspired by the success of LLM-based agents in various fields, we propose CompileAgent, the first LLM-based agent framework dedicated to repo-level compilation. CompileAgent integrates five tools and a flow-based agent strategy, enabling interaction with software artifacts for compilation instruction search and error resolution. To measure the effectiveness of our method, we design a public repo-level benchmark CompileAgentBench, and we also design two baselines for comparison by combining two compilation-friendly schemes. The performance on this benchmark shows that our method significantly improves the compilation success rate, ranging from 10% to 71%. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of CompileAgent under different agent strategies and verify the effectiveness of the flow-based strategy. Additionally, we emphasize the scalability of CompileAgent, further expanding its application prospects.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Facilitating Trustworthy Human-Agent Collaboration in LLM-based Multi-Agent System oriented Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04251v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent autonomous systems (MAS) are better at addressing challenges that spans across multiple domains than singular autonomous agents. This holds true within the field of software engineering (SE) as well. The state-of-the-art research on MAS within SE focuses on integrating LLMs at the core of autonomous agents to create LLM-based multi-agent autonomous (LMA) systems. However, the introduction of LMA systems into SE brings a plethora of challenges. One of the major challenges is the strategic allocation of tasks between humans and the LMA system in a trustworthy manner. To address this challenge, a RACI-based framework is proposed in this work in progress article, along with implementation guidelines and an example implementation of the framework. The proposed framework can facilitate efficient collaboration, ensure accountability, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM-driven automation while aligning with the Trustworthy AI guidelines. The future steps for this work delineating the planned empirical validation method are also presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Code Customization with Visual Results: A Benchmark on TikZ](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04670v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of AI-based code generation, customizing existing code out of natural language instructions to modify visual results -such as figures or images -has become possible, promising to reduce the need for deep programming expertise. However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies show that dependency network metrics improve defect prediction, most methods focus on code-based dependency graphs, overlooking developer factors. Current metrics, based on handcrafted features like ego and global network metrics, fail to fully capture defect-related information. To address this, we propose DeMuVGN, a defect prediction model that learns multi-view software dependency via graph neural networks. We introduce a Multi-view Software Dependency Graph (MSDG) that integrates data, call, and developer dependencies. DeMuVGN also leverages the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance and enhance defect module identification. In a case study of eight open-source projects across 20 versions, DeMuVGN demonstrates significant improvements: i) models based on multi-view graphs improve F1 scores by 11.1% to 12.1% over single-view models; ii) DeMuVGN improves F1 scores by 17.4% to 45.8% in within-project contexts and by 17.9% to 41.0% in cross-project contexts. Additionally, DeMuVGN excels in software evolution, showing more improvement in later-stage software versions. Its strong performance across different projects highlights its generalizability. We recommend future research focus on multi-view dependency graphs for defect prediction in both mature and newly developed projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The current paper is not comprehensive enough.

However, this growth has also drawn the attention of malicious actors, with some phishers extending their reach into the Solana ecosystem. Unlike platforms such as Ethereum, Solana has distinct designs of accounts and transactions, leading to the emergence of new types of phishing transactions that we term SolPhish. We define three types of SolPhish and develop a detection tool called SolPhishHunter. Utilizing SolPhishHunter, we detect a total of 8,058 instances of SolPhish and conduct an empirical analysis of these detected cases. Our analysis explores the distribution and impact of SolPhish, the characteristics of the phishers, and the relationships among phishing gangs. Particularly, the detected SolPhish transactions have resulted in nearly \$1.1 million in losses for victims. We report our detection results to the community and construct SolPhishDataset, the \emph{first} Solana phishing-related dataset in academia.</p></details> |  |

However, OpenAI APIs introduce unique challenges that differ from traditional APIs, such as the complexities of prompt engineering, token-based cost management, non-deterministic outputs, and operation as black boxes. To the best of our knowledge, the challenges developers encounter when using OpenAI APIs have not been explored in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study by analyzing 2,874 OpenAI API-related discussions from the popular Q&A forum Stack Overflow. We first examine the popularity and difficulty of these posts. After manually categorizing them into nine OpenAI API-related categories, we identify specific challenges associated with each category through topic modeling analysis. Based on our empirical findings, we finally propose actionable implications for developers, LLM vendors, and researchers.</p></details> |  |

Many strategies have been proposed to guide test-case generation, such as source-code-based approaches and methods based on bug reports. Requirements-based test generation (RBTG) constructs test cases based on specified requirements, aligning with user needs and expectations, without requiring access to the source code. Since its introduction in 1994, there have been many contributions to the development of RBTG, including various approaches, implementations, tools, assessment and evaluation methods, and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on RBTG, categorizing requirement types, classifying approaches, investigating types of test cases, summarizing available tools, and analyzing experimental evaluations. This paper also summarizes the domains and industrial applications of RBTG, and discusses some open research challenges and potential future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification and Optimization of Redundant Code Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04040v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Redundant code is a persistent challenge in software development that makes systems harder to maintain, scale, and update. It adds unnecessary complexity, hinders bug fixes, and increases technical debt. Despite their impact, removing redundant code manually is risky and error-prone, often introducing new bugs or missing dependencies. While studies highlight the prevalence and negative impact of redundant code, little focus has been given to Artificial Intelligence (AI) system codebases and the common patterns that cause redundancy. Additionally, the reasons behind developers unintentionally introducing redundant code remain largely unexplored. This research addresses these gaps by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and optimize redundant code in AI projects. Our research aims to identify recurring patterns of redundancy and analyze their underlying causes, such as outdated practices or insufficient awareness of best coding principles. Additionally, we plan to propose an LLM agent that will facilitate the detection and refactoring of redundancies on a large scale while preserving original functionality. This work advances the application of AI in identifying and optimizing redundant code, ultimately helping developers maintain cleaner, more readable, and scalable codebases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gender Disparities in Contributions, Leadership, and Collaboration: An Exploratory Study on Software Systems Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15661v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gender diversity enhances research by bringing diverse perspectives and innovative approaches. It ensures equitable solutions that address the needs of diverse populations. However, gender disparity persists in research where women remain underrepresented, which might limit diversity and innovation. Many even leave scientific careers as their contributions often go unnoticed and undervalued. Therefore, understanding gender-based contributions and collaboration dynamics is crucial to addressing this gap and creating a more inclusive research environment. In this study, we analyzed 2,000 articles published over the past decade in the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS). From these, we selected 384 articles that detailed authors' contributions and contained both female and male authors to investigate gender-based contributions. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we analyzed women's engagement in software systems research. Our analysis showed that only 32.74% of the total authors are women and female-led or supervised studies were fewer than those of men. Second, we investigated female authors' contributions across 14 major roles. Interestingly, we found that women contributed comparably to men in most roles, with more contributions in conceptualization, writing, and reviewing articles. Third, we explored the areas of software systems research and found that female authors are more actively involved in human-centric research domains. Finally, we analyzed gender-based collaboration dynamics. Our findings revealed that female supervisors tended to collaborate locally more often than national-level collaborations. Our study highlights that females' contributions to software systems research are comparable to those of men. Therefore, the barriers need to be addressed to enhance female participation and ensure equity and inclusivity in research.</p></details> |  |

Deadlines are a leading cause of the emergence of TD in software systems. While multiple aspects of TD have been studied, the empirical research findings on the impact of deadlines are still inconclusive. Aims: This study investigates the impact of scheduled deadlines on TD. It analyzes how scheduled deadlines affect code quality, commit activities, and issues in issue-tracking systems. Method: We analyzed eight Open Source Software (OSS) projects with regular release schedules using SonarQube. We analyzed 12.3k commits and 371 releases across these eight OSS projects. The study combined quantitative metrics with qualitative analyses to comprehensively understand TD accumulation under scheduled deadlines. Results: Our findings indicated that some projects had a clear increase in TD as deadlines approached (with above 50% of releases having increasing TD accumulation as deadlines approached), while others managed to maintain roughly the same amount of TD. Analysis of commit activities and issue tracking revealed that deadline proximity could lead to increased commit frequency and bug-related issue creation. Conclusions: Our study highlights that, in some cases, impending deadlines have a clear impact on TD. The findings pinpoint the need to mitigate last-minute coding rushes and the risks associated with deadline-driven TD accumulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

To ensure call-taking performance consistency, quality assurance is implemented to evaluate and refine call-takers' skillsets. However, traditional human-led evaluations struggle with high call volumes, leading to low coverage and delayed assessments. We introduce LogiDebrief, an AI-driven framework that automates traditional 9-1-1 call debriefing by integrating Signal-Temporal Logic (STL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for fully-covered rigorous performance evaluation. LogiDebrief formalizes call-taking requirements as logical specifications, enabling systematic assessment of 9-1-1 calls against procedural guidelines. It employs a three-step verification process: (1) contextual understanding to identify responder types, incident classifications, and critical conditions; (2) STL-based runtime checking with LLM integration to ensure compliance; and (3) automated aggregation of results into quality assurance reports. Beyond its technical contributions, LogiDebrief has demonstrated real-world impact. Successfully deployed at Metro Nashville Department of Emergency Communications, it has assisted in debriefing 1,701 real-world calls, saving 311.85 hours of active engagement. Empirical evaluation with real-world data confirms its accuracy, while a case study and extensive user study highlight its effectiveness in enhancing call-taking performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI-2025</p></details> |

This study systematically examines trust dynamics and system design by analyzing human reactions to robot failures. We conducted a four-stage survey to explore how trust evolves throughout human-robot interactions. The first stage collected demographic data and initial trust levels. The second stage focused on preliminary expectations and perceptions of robotic capabilities. The third stage examined interaction details, including robot precision and error acknowledgment. Finally, the fourth stage assessed post-interaction perceptions, evaluating trust dynamics, forgiveness, and willingness to recommend robotic technologies. Results indicate that trust in robotic systems significantly increased when robots acknowledged their errors or limitations. Additionally, participants showed greater willingness to suggest robots for future tasks, highlighting the importance of direct engagement in shaping trust dynamics. These findings provide valuable insights for designing more transparent, responsive, and trustworthy robotic systems. By enhancing our understanding of human-robot interaction (HRI), this study contributes to the development of robotic technologies that foster greater public acceptance and adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, Ongoing Research</p></details> |

However, the sensor characteristics, proximity to the structure, hard-to-reach access, and environmental conditions often limit the resolution of the datasets. A few studies used super-resolution techniques to address the problem of low-resolution images. Nevertheless, these techniques were observed to increase computational cost and false alarms of distress detection due to the consideration of all the infrastructure images i.e., positive and negative distress classes. In order to address the pre-processing of false alarm and achieve efficient super-resolution, this study developed a framework consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network (ESPCNN). CNN accurately classified both the classes. ESPCNN, which is the lightweight super-resolution technique, generated high-resolution infrastructure image of positive distress obtained from CNN. The ESPCNN outperformed bicubic interpolation in all the evaluation metrics for super-resolution. Based on the performance metrics, the combination of CNN and ESPCNN was observed to be effective in preprocessing the infrastructure images with negative distress, reducing the computational cost and false alarms in the next step of super-resolution. The visual inspection showed that EPSCNN is able to capture crack propagation, complex geometry of even minor cracks. The proposed framework is expected to help the highway agencies in accurately performing distress detection and assist in efficient asset management practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented :Transportation Research Board 104th Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C</p></details> |

One key challenge is achieving precise positioning, especially for large aircraft structures, where errors can lead to substantial maintenance costs or part rejection. Existing solutions often require costly hardware or lack flexibility. Used in aircraft by the thousands, threaded fasteners, e.g., screws, bolts, and collars, are traditionally executed by fixed-base robots and usually have problems in being deployed in the mentioned manufacturing sites. This paper emphasizes the importance of error detection and classification for efficient and safe assembly of threaded fasteners, especially aeronautical collars. Safe assembly of threaded fasteners is paramount since acquiring sufficient data for training deep learning models poses challenges due to the rarity of failure cases and imbalanced datasets. The paper addresses this by proposing techniques like class weighting and data augmentation, specifically tailored for temporal series data, to improve classification performance. Furthermore, the paper introduces a novel problem-modeling approach, emphasizing metrics relevant to collar assembly rather than solely focusing on accuracy. This tailored approach enhances the models' capability to handle the challenges of threaded fastener assembly effectively.</p></details> |  |

Pioneering research over the past years has proposed various approaches to formally verify quantum programs using proof systems such as quantum Hoare logic. All these prior approaches are post-hoc: one first implements a program and only then verifies its correctness. Here we propose Quantum Correctness by Construction (QbC): an approach to constructing quantum programs from their specification in a way that ensures correctness. We use pre- and postconditions to specify program properties, and propose sound and complete refinement rules for constructing programs in a quantum while language from their specification. We validate QbC by constructing quantum programs for idiomatic problems and patterns. We find that the approach naturally suggests how to derive program details, highlighting key design choices along the way. As such, we believe that QbC can play a role in supporting the design and taxonomization of quantum algorithms and software.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3. 4...</summary><p>v3. 43 pages, latest author version, to appear at OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While ChatGPT's potential has been extensively discussed, there is limited empirical evidence exploring its real-world usage by developers. This study bridges this gap by conducting a large-scale empirical analysis of ChatGPT-assisted development activities, leveraging a curated dataset, DevChat, comprising 2,547 unique shared ChatGPT links collected from GitHub between May 2023 and June 2024. Our study examines the characteristics of ChatGPT's usage on GitHub (including the tendency, prompt turns distribution, and link descriptions) and identifies five categories of developers' purposes for sharing developer-ChatGPT conversations during software development. Additionally, we analyzed the development-related activities where developers shared ChatGPT links to facilitate their workflows. We then established a mapping framework among data sources, activities, and SE tasks associated with these shared ChatGPT links.

While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense, high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83 software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B, including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning, and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for real-world desktop tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |

Goal: To explore the challenges that women face across three different life stages, beginning as high school students, continuing as university undergraduates, and extending into their professional lives, as well as potential solutions to address these challenges. Research Method: We conducted a literature review followed by workshops to understand the perspectives of high school women, undergraduates, and practitioners regarding the same set of challenges and solutions identified in the literature. Results: Regardless of the life stage, women feel discouraged in a toxic environment often characterized by a lack of inclusion, harassment, and the exhausting need to prove themselves. We also discovered that some challenges are specific to certain life stages; for example, issues related to maternity were mentioned only by practitioners. Conclusions: Gender-related challenges arise before women enter the software development field when the proportion of men and women is still similar. While the need to prove themselves is mentioned at all three stages, high school women's challenges are more often directed toward convincing their parents that they are mature enough to handle their responsibilities.

| **[Moral Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03683v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing plays a crucial role in their development, with the current focus primarily on functional and safety testing. However, evaluating the non-functional morality of ADSs, particularly their decision-making capabilities in unavoidable collision scenarios, is equally important to ensure the systems' trustworthiness and public acceptance. Unfortunately, testing ADS morality is nearly impossible due to the absence of universal moral principles. To address this challenge, this paper first extracts a set of moral meta-principles derived from existing moral experiments and well-established social science theories, aiming to capture widely recognized and common-sense moral values for ADSs. These meta-principles are then formalized as quantitative moral metamorphic relations, which act as the test oracle. Furthermore, we propose a metamorphic testing framework to systematically identify potential moral issues. Finally, we illustrate the implementation of the framework and present typical violation cases using the VIRES VTD simulator and its built-in ADS.</p></details> |  |

Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating survival data reconstruction, survival model learning, and survival probability estimation. Our approach transforms battery voltage time series into time-to-failure data using path signatures. The multiple Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods, such as DeepHit and MTLR, are learned to predict battery failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on the Toyota battery and NASA battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index (C-Index) while maintaining a low integrated Brier score. The data and source codes for this work are available to the public at https://github.com/thinkxca/rul.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating these artifacts is essential to assess tradeoffs and risks affecting quality attributes such as performance, modifiability, and security. Although methodologies like the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) support software architecture evaluation, their industrial focus misaligns with the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) format prevalent in academic research, impeding transparency and reproducibility. Our prior work introduced the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF), extending ATAM through three methods -- ATRAM, RATRAM, and AFTRAM, addressing all abstraction levels, using a unified, iterative four-phase spiral model. These phases -- Scenario and Requirements Gathering, Architectural Views and Scenario Realization, Attribute-Specific Analyses, and Sensitivity, Tradeoff, and Risk Analysis -- ensure traceability and coherence. This paper presents the ATRAF-driven IMRaD Methodology, a concise method to align ATRAF's phases with IMRaD sections. This methodology enhances the rigor, transparency, and accessibility of software architecture research, enabling systematic reporting of complex evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing approaches to generating 3D geometry most commonly use meshes as a 3D representation. While meshes are suitable for assets in video games or animations, they lack sufficient precision and adaptability for mechanical engineering purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach for the generation of 3D geometry that generates surface-based Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) by leveraging a code-generation LLM. First, we create a dataset of 3D mechanical parts represented as code scripts by converting Boundary Representation geometry (BREP) into CSG-based Python scripts. Second, we create annotations in natural language using GPT-4. The resulting dataset is used to fine-tune a code-generation LLM. The fine-tuned LLM can complete geometries based on positional input and natural language in a plausible way, demonstrating geometric understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AI for Content Creation Workshop at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object grounding with simple (bare) queries, but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene graph representation with metric and semantic spatial edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to construct 3D object-centric map and an advanced raycasting algorithm with a 2D vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On the Replica and ScanNet datasets, we have demonstrated that BBQ takes a leading place in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation compared to other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On challenging Sr3D+, Nr3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling objects grounding by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our design choices and software implementation has resulted in significant data processing speed in experiments on the robot on-board computer. This promising performance enables the application of our approach in intelligent robotics projects. We made the code publicly available at https://linukc.github.io/BeyondBareQueries/.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[The Struggles of LLMs in Cross-lingual Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04430v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) 2025</p></details> |

With advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of tackling complex problems across diverse domains. Unlike traditional computational systems, LLMs combine raw computational power with an approximation of human reasoning, allowing them to generate solutions, make inferences, and even leverage external computational tools. However, applying LLMs to real-world problem-solving presents significant challenges, including multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration, and result verification. This survey explores the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in complex problem-solving, examining techniques including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, knowledge augmentation, and various LLM-based and tool-based verification techniques. Additionally, we highlight domain-specific challenges in various domains, such as software engineering, mathematical reasoning and proving, data analysis and modeling, and scientific research. The paper further discusses the fundamental limitations of the current LLM solutions and the future directions of LLM-based complex problems solving from the perspective of multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration and result verification.</p></details> |  |

Compared to the state-vector approach, the extended stabilizer formalism can solve the same problems with fewer computational resources, as it operates on stabilizers rather than full state vectors. Most existing studies on near-Clifford circuits focus on balancing the trade-off between the number of ancilla qubits and simulation accuracy, often overlooking performance considerations. Furthermore, in the presence of high-rank stabilizers, performance is limited by the sequential property of the stabilizer formalism. In this work, we introduce a parallelized version of the extended stabilizer formalism, enabling efficient execution on multi-core devices such as GPU. Experimental results demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, our Python-based implementation outperforms state-of-the-art simulators such as Qiskit and Pennylane.</p></details> |  |

Capabilities define the functions of resources in a machine-readable form and skills provide the concrete implementations that realize those capabilities. However, the development of a skill implementation conforming to a corresponding capability remains a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we present a method that treats capabilities as contracts for skill implementations and leverages large language models to generate executable code based on natural language user input. A key feature of our approach is the integration of existing software libraries and interface technologies, enabling the generation of skill implementations across different target languages. We introduce a framework that allows users to incorporate their own libraries and resource interfaces into the code generation process through a retrieval-augmented generation architecture. The proposed method is evaluated using an autonomous mobile robot controlled via Python and ROS 2, demonstrating the feasibility and flexibility of the approach.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RAG-MCP, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that overcomes this challenge by offloading tool discovery. RAG-MCP uses semantic retrieval to identify the most relevant MCP(s) for a given query from an external index before engaging the LLM. Only the selected tool descriptions are passed to the model, drastically reducing prompt size and simplifying decision-making. Experiments, including an MCP stress test, demonstrate RAG-MCP significantly cuts prompt tokens (e.g., by over 50%) and more than triples tool selection accuracy (43.13% vs 13.62% baseline) on benchmark tasks. RAG-MCP enables scalable and accurate tool integration for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthline: A Product Line Approach for Synthetic Requirements Engineering Data Generation using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03265v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While modern Requirements Engineering (RE) heavily relies on natural language processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This paper introduces Synthline, a Product Line (PL) approach that leverages Large Language Models to systematically generate synthetic RE data for classification-based use cases. Through an empirical evaluation conducted in the context of using ML for the identification of requirements specification defects, we investigated both the diversity of the generated data and its utility for training downstream models. Our analysis reveals that while synthetic datasets exhibit less diversity than real data, they are good enough to serve as viable training resources. Moreover, our evaluation shows that combining synthetic and real data leads to substantial performance improvements. Specifically, hybrid approaches achieve up to 85% improvement in precision and a 2x increase in recall compared to models trained exclusively on real data. These findings demonstrate the potential of PL-based synthetic data generation to address data scarcity in RE. We make both our implementation and generated datasets publicly available to support reproducibility and advancement in the field.</p></details> |  |

As machine learning systems increasingly transform scientific fields, the question of how to effectively evaluate these systems becomes crucial for ensuring reliable progress. In this review, we examine the current state and future directions of evaluation frameworks for machine learning in science. We organize the review around a broadly applicable framework for evaluating machine learning systems through the lens of statistical measurement theory, using materials science as our primary context for examples and case studies. We identify key challenges common across machine learning evaluation such as construct validity, data quality issues, metric design limitations, and benchmark maintenance problems that can lead to phantom progress when evaluation frameworks fail to capture real-world performance needs. By examining both traditional benchmarks and emerging evaluation approaches, we demonstrate how evaluation choices fundamentally shape not only our measurements but also research priorities and scientific progress. These findings reveal the critical need for transparency in evaluation design and reporting, leading us to propose evaluation cards as a structured approach to documenting measurement choices and limitations. Our work highlights the importance of developing a more diverse toolbox of evaluation techniques for machine learning in materials science, while offering insights that can inform evaluation practices in other scientific domains where similar challenges exist.</p></details> |  |

Many of these documents exist as images rather than as machine-readable text, which requires human annotation to train automated extraction systems. We present DocSpiral, the first Human-in-the-Spiral assistive document annotation platform, designed to address the challenge of extracting structured information from domain-specific, image-based document collections. Our spiral design establishes an iterative cycle in which human annotations train models that progressively require less manual intervention. DocSpiral integrates document format normalization, comprehensive annotation interfaces, evaluation metrics dashboard, and API endpoints for the development of AI / ML models into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that our framework reduces annotation time by at least 41\% while showing consistent performance gains across three iterations during model training. By making this annotation platform freely accessible, we aim to lower barriers to AI/ML models development in document processing, facilitating the adoption of large language models in image-based, document-intensive fields such as geoscience and healthcare. The system is freely available at: https://app.ai4wa.com. The demonstration video is available: https://app.ai4wa.com/docs/docspiral/demo.</p></details> |  |

However, alongside these advancements, there have been increasing concerns about reproducing the results of these deep learning methods. This is significant because reproducibility is the foundation of reliability and validity in software development, particularly in the rapidly evolving domain of deep learning. The difficulty of reproducibility may arise due to several reasons, including having differences from the original execution environment, incompatible software libraries, proprietary data and source code, lack of transparency, and the stochastic nature in some software. A study conducted by the Nature journal reveals that more than 70% of researchers failed to reproduce other researchers experiments and over 50% failed to reproduce their own experiments. Irreproducibility of deep learning poses significant challenges for researchers and practitioners. To address these concerns, this paper presents a systematic approach at analyzing and improving the reproducibility of deep learning models by demonstrating these guidelines using a case study. We illustrate the patterns and anti-patterns involved with these guidelines for improving the reproducibility of deep learning models. These guidelines encompass establishing a methodology to replicate the original software environment, implementing end-to-end training and testing algorithms, disclosing architectural designs, and enhancing transparency in data processing and training pipelines. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the model performance across diverse conditions. By implementing these strategies, we aim to bridge the gap between research and practice, so that innovations in deep learning can be effectively reproduced and deployed within software.</p></details> |  |

Quantization and sparsity are key techniques that translate to repetition and sparsity within tensors at the hardware-software interface. This paper introduces the concept of repetition-sparsity trade-off that helps explain computational efficiency during inference. We propose PLUM, a unified co-design framework that integrates DNN inference systems and quantization (forward and backward pass) to leverage the repetition-sparsity trade-off to improve inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that PLUM's quantization method is more accurate than binary quantization with the same number of non-zero weights. Detailed analysis indicates that signed binarization generates a smaller distribution of effectual (non-zero) parameters nested within a larger distribution of total parameters of latent full-precision weights for a DNN block. Finally, the proposed PLUM framework achieves a 26% speedup on real hardware, doubles energy efficiency, and reduces density by 2.8x compared to binary methods while retaining top-1 accuracy when compared to prior-art methods for ResNets on ImageNet (by achieving 66.2% top-1 accuracy), presenting an alternative solution for deploying efficient models in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenR...</summary><p>OpenReview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=IEKtMMSblm</p></details> |

LLM-MAS can potentially improve a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and generating content to automating customer support and improving decision-making processes. However, LLM-MAS in production or preproduction environments can be vulnerable to emergent errors or disruptions, such as hallucinations, agent failures, and agent communication failures. This study proposes a chaos engineering framework to proactively identify such vulnerabilities in LLM-MAS, assess and build resilience against them, and ensure reliable performance in critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Specifications for such systems are often standardized in natural language documents, like Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specifications or IETF RFC's. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in both generating tests and handling large volumes of natural language text, making them well-suited for analyzing artifacts like specification documents, bug reports, and code implementations. In this work, we leverage natural language and code artifacts to guide LLMs to generate targeted tests that highlight meaningful behavioral differences between implementations, including those corresponding to bugs. We introduce DiffSpec, a framework for generating differential tests with LLMs using prompt chaining. We demonstrate DiffSpec's efficacy on two different (extensively tested) systems, eBPF runtimes and Wasm validators. Using DiffSpec, we generated 1901 differentiating tests, uncovering at least four distinct and confirmed bugs in eBPF, including a kernel memory leak, inconsistent behavior in jump instructions, undefined behavior when using the stack pointer, and tests with infinite loops that hang the verifier in ebpf-for-windows. We also found 299 differentiating tests in Wasm validators pointing to two confirmed and fixed bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on the Impact of Gender Diversity on Code Quality in AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03082v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI systems necessitates high-quality, sustainable code to ensure reliability and mitigate risks such as bias and technical debt. However, the underrepresentation of women in software engineering raises concerns about homogeneity in AI development. Studying gender diversity in AI systems is crucial, as diverse perspectives are essential for improving system robustness, reducing bias, and enhancing overall code quality. While prior research has demonstrated the benefits of diversity in general software teams, its specific impact on the code quality of AI systems remains unexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining how gender diversity within AI teams influences project popularity, code quality, and individual contributions. Our study makes three key contributions. First, we analyzed the relationship between team diversity and repository popularity, revealing that diverse AI repositories not only differ significantly from non-diverse ones but also achieve higher popularity and greater community engagement. Second, we explored the effect of diversity on the overall code quality of AI systems and found that diverse repositories tend to have superior code quality compared to non-diverse ones. Finally, our analysis of individual contributions revealed that although female contributors contribute to a smaller proportion of the total code, their contributions demonstrate consistently higher quality than those of their male counterparts. These findings highlight the need to remove barriers to female participation in AI development, as greater diversity can improve the overall quality of AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Due to nondeterministic I/O operations, traditional testing methods struggle to rapidly achieve coverage of firmware code areas that require extensive I/O accumulation. To address this challenge, we propose a state data-aware fuzzing approach that leverages SSD firmware's internal state to guide input generation under nondeterministic I/O conditions and accelerate coverage discovery. Our experiments with an open-source SSD firmware emulator show that the proposed method achieves the same firmware test coverage as a state-of-the-art coverage-based fuzzer (AFL++) while requiring approximately 67% fewer commands, without reducing the number of crashes or hangs detected. Moreover, we extend our experiments by incorporating various I/O commands beyond basic write/read operations to reflect real user scenarios, and we confirm that our strategy remains effective even for multiple types of I/O tests. We further validate the effectiveness of state data-aware fuzzing for firmware testing under I/O environments and suggest that this approach can be extended to other storage firmware or threshold-based embedded systems in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

Adversarial attacks can compromise the reliability and security of software systems, so understanding how LLM-generated data performs under these conditions, compared to human-written data, which serves as the benchmark for model performance, can provide valuable insights into whether LLM-generated data offers similar robustness and effectiveness. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate and compare the quality of human-written and LLM-generated data for fine-tuning robust pre-trained models (PTMs) in the context of adversarial attacks. We evaluate the robustness of six widely used PTMs, fine-tuned on human-written and LLM-generated data, before and after adversarial attacks. This evaluation employs nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial attack techniques across three popular software analytics tasks: clone detection, code summarization, and sentiment analysis in code review discussions. Additionally, we analyze the quality of the generated adversarial examples using eleven similarity metrics. Our findings reveal that while PTMs fine-tuned on LLM-generated data perform competitively with those fine-tuned on human-written data, they exhibit less robustness against adversarial attacks in software analytics tasks. Our study underscores the need for further exploration into enhancing the quality of LLM-generated training data to develop models that are both high-performing and capable of withstanding adversarial attacks in software analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AI Model/Data Track of the Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of machine translation (MT) performance on bug reports, analyzing the capabilities of DeepL, AWS Translate, and large language models such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and Mistral using data from the Visual Studio Code GitHub repository, specifically focusing on reports labeled with the english-please tag. To assess both translation quality and source language identification accuracy, we employ a range of MT evaluation metrics-including BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, METEOR, and ROUGE-alongside classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings reveal that while ChatGPT (gpt-4o) excels in semantic and lexical translation quality, it does not lead in source language identification. Claude and Mistral achieve the highest F1-scores (0.7182 and 0.7142, respectively), and Gemini records the best precision (0.7414). AWS Translate shows the highest accuracy (0.4717) in identifying source languages. These results highlight that no single system dominates across all tasks, reinforcing the importance of task-specific evaluations. This study underscores the need for domain adaptation when translating technical content and provides actionable insights for integrating MT into bug-triaging workflows.

An Empirical Evaluation of Model Selection Mechanisms for AIOps Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02961v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) solutions leverage the tremendous amount of data produced during the operation of large-scale systems and machine learning models to assist software practitioners in their system operations. Existing AIOps solutions usually maintain AIOps models against concept drift through periodical retraining, despite leaving a pile of discarded historical models that may perform well on specific future data. Other prior works propose dynamically selecting models for prediction tasks from a set of candidate models to optimize the model performance. However, there is no prior work in the AIOps area that assesses the use of model selection mechanisms on historical models to improve model performance or robustness. To fill the gap, we evaluate several model selection mechanisms by assessing their capabilities in selecting the optimal AIOps models that were built in the past to make predictions for the target data. We performed a case study on three large-scale public operation datasets: two trace datasets from the cloud computing platforms of Google and Alibaba, and one disk stats dataset from the BackBlaze cloud storage data center. We observe that the model selection mechnisms utilizing temporal adjacency tend to have a better performance and can prevail the periodical retraining approach. Our findings also highlight a performance gap between existing model selection mechnisms and the theoretical upper bound which may motivate future researchers and practitioners in investigating more efficient and effective model selection mechanisms that fit in the context of AIOps.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.03213</p></details> |

Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs. We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J. Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the research track of the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, T\"urkiye</p></details> |

To evaluate the new recommenders, we conduct three A/B tests which are a type of randomized controlled experimental trial. Expt 1. We developed a new recommender based on features that had been successfully used in the literature and that could be calculated with low latency. In an A/B test on 82k diffs in Spring of 2022, we found that the new recommender was more accurate and had lower latency. Expt 2. Reviewer workload is not evenly distributed, our goal was to reduce the workload of top reviewers. We then ran an A/B test on 28k diff authors in Winter 2023 on a workload balanced recommender. Our A/B test led to mixed results. Expt 3. We suspected the bystander effect might be slowing down reviews of diffs where only a team was assigned. We conducted an A/B test on 12.5k authors in Spring 2023 and found a large decrease in the amount of time it took for diffs to be reviewed when a recommended individual was explicitly assigned. Our findings also suggest there can be a discrepancy between historical back-testing and A/B test experimental findings.</p></details> |  |

Automated software testing tools can be developed to quickly analyze many lines of code and detect vulnerabilities by generating function-specific testing data. This process draws similarities to the constrained adversarial examples generated by adversarial machine learning methods, so there could be significant benefits to the integration of these methods in testing tools to identify possible attack vectors. Therefore, this literature review is focused on the current state-of-the-art of constrained data generation approaches applied for adversarial learning and software testing, aiming to guide researchers and developers to enhance their software testing tools with adversarial testing methods and improve the resilience and robustness of their information systems. The found approaches were systematized, and the advantages and limitations of those specific for white-box, grey-box, and black-box testing were analyzed, identifying research gaps and opportunities to automate the testing tools with data generated by adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 4 tables, 2 figures, Discover Applied Sciences journal</p></details> |

| **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Attributed Patch Semantic Graph for Automated Patch Correctness Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02629v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) aims to automatically repair program errors without human intervention, and recent years have witnessed a growing interest on this research topic. While much progress has been made and techniques originating from different disciplines have been proposed, APR techniques generally suffer from the patch overfitting issue, i.e., the generated patches are not genuinely correct despite they pass the employed tests. To alleviate this issue, many research efforts have been devoted for automated patch correctness assessment (APCA). In particular, with the emergence of large language model (LLM) technology, researchers have employed LLM to assess the patch correctness and have obtained the state-of-the-art performance. The literature on APCA has demonstrated the importance of capturing patch semantic and explicitly considering certain code attributes in predicting patch correctness. However, existing LLM-based methods typically treat code as token sequences and ignore the inherent formal structure for code, making it difficult to capture the deep patch semantics. Moreover, these LLM-based methods also do not explicitly account for enough code attributes. To overcome these drawbacks, we in this paper design a novel patch graph representation named attributed patch semantic graph (APSG), which adequately captures the patch semantic and explicitly reflects important patch attributes. To effectively use graph information in APSG, we accordingly propose a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method of LLMs named Graph-LoRA. Extensive evaluations have been conducted to evaluate our method, and the results show that compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves accuracy and F1 score by 2.3% to 6.6% and 1.8% to 6.1% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

To the success of system design automation, there is still a lack of systematic and formal design process because an entire design process, from a system's specification to its implementation, has to deal with inherent concerns about the systems' different aspects and, consequently, inherent semantic gaps. These gaps make it hard for a design process to be traceable or transparent. Particularly, guaranteeing the correctness of produced implementations becomes the main challenge for a system design process. SynQ (Synchronous system design with Quantitative types) is an embedded domain specification language (EDSL) targeting the design of systems obeying the perfect synchrony hypothesis. SynQ is based on a component-based design framework and, by design, facilitates semantic coherency by leveraging the quantitative type theory (QTT) and language embedding. SynQ enables a semantically coherent design process, including formal specification and verification, modelling, simulation and code generation. This paper presents SynQ and its underlying formalism and demonstrates its features and potential for semantically coherent system design through a case study.</p></details> | 45 pages, 15 figures |

However, insecure defaults and misconfigurations often expose LLM services to the public Internet, posing significant security and system engineering risks. Aims: This study aims to unveil the current landscape of public-facing LLM deployments in the wild through a large-scale empirical study, focusing on service prevalence, exposure characteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Method: We conducted an Internet-wide measurement to identify public-facing LLM deployments across 15 frameworks, discovering 320,102 services. We extracted 158 unique API endpoints, grouped into 12 functional categories based on capabilities and security risks. We further analyzed configurations, authentication practices, and geographic distributions, revealing deployment trends and systemic issues in real-world LLM system engineering. Results: Our study shows that public LLM deployments are rapidly growing but often insecure. Among all endpoints, we observe widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS configurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. Security risks, including model disclosure, system leakage, and unauthorized access, are pervasive, highlighting the need for secure-by-default frameworks and stronger deployment practices. Conclusions: Public-facing LLM deployments suffer from widespread security and configuration flaws, exposing services to misuse, model theft, resource hijacking, and remote exploitation. Strengthening default security, deployment practices, and operational standards is critical for the growing self-hosted LLM ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Automotive Software Development: A Synergy of Generative AI and Formal Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02500v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the automotive industry shifts its focus toward software-defined vehicles, the need for faster and reliable software development continues to grow. However, traditional methods show their limitations. The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), introduces new opportunities to automate automotive software development tasks such as requirement analysis and code generation. However, due to the complexity of automotive systems, where software components must interact with each other seamlessly, challenges remain in software integration and system-level validation. In this paper, we propose to combine GenAI with model-driven engineering to automate automotive software development. Our approach uses LLMs to convert free-text requirements into event chain descriptions and to generate platform-independent software components that realize the required functionality. At the same time, formal models are created based on event chain descriptions to support system validation and the generation of integration code for integrating generated software components in the whole vehicle system through middleware. This approach increases development automation while enabling formal analysis to improve system reliability. As a proof of concept, we used GPT-4o to implement our method and tested it in the CARLA simulation environment with ROS2 middleware. We evaluated the system in a simple Autonomous Emergency Braking scenario.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning-Guided Fuzzing for Testing Stateful SDN Controllers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08626v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllers for software-defined networks (SDNs) are centralised software components that enable advanced network functionalities, such as dynamic traffic engineering and network virtualisation. However, these functionalities increase the complexity of SDN controllers, making thorough testing crucial. SDN controllers are stateful, interacting with multiple network devices through sequences of control messages. Identifying stateful failures in an SDN controller is challenging due to the infinite possible sequences of control messages, which result in an unbounded number of stateful interactions between the controller and network devices. In this article, we propose SeqFuzzSDN, a learning-guided fuzzing method for testing stateful SDN controllers. SeqFuzzSDN aims to (1) efficiently explore the state space of the SDN controller under test, (2) generate effective and diverse tests (i.e., control message sequences) to uncover failures, and (3) infer accurate failure-inducing models that characterise the message sequences leading to failures. In addition, we compare SeqFuzzSDN with three extensions of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for fuzzing SDNs. Our findings show that, compared to the extended SOTA methods, SeqFuzzSDN (1) generates more diverse message sequences that lead to failures within the same time budget, and (2) produces more accurate failure-inducing models, significantly outperforming the other extended SOTA methods in terms of sensitivity.</p></details> |  |

The EHRI project set out to mitigate this problem by building a trans-national network of archives, researchers, and digital practitioners, and one of its main outcomes was the creation of the EHRI Portal, a "virtual observatory" that gathers in one centralised platform descriptions of Holocaust-related archival sources from around the world. In order to build the Portal a strong data identification and integration effort was required, culminating in the project's third phase with the creation of the EHRI-3 data integration lab. The focus of the lab was to lower the bar to participation in the EHRI Portal by providing support to institutions in conforming their archival metadata with that required for integration, ultimately opening the process up to smaller institutions (and even so-called "micro-archives") without the necessary resources to undertake this process themselves. In this paper we present our experiences from running the data integration lab and discuss some of the challenges (both of a technical and social nature), how we tried to overcome them, and the overall lessons learnt. We envisage this work as an archetype upon which other practitioners seeking to pursue similar data integration activities can build their own efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage</p></details> |

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant contributions to reactor physics, e.g., in operational simulations, safety design, real-time monitoring, core management and maintenance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of AI approaches in reactor physics, especially considering the category of Machine Learning (ML), with the aim of describing the application scenarios, frontier topics, unsolved challenges and future research directions. From equation solving and state parameter prediction to nuclear industry applications, this paper provides a step-by-step overview of ML methods applied to steady-state, transient and combustion problems. Most literature works achieve industry-demanded models by enhancing the efficiency of deterministic methods or correcting uncertainty methods, which leads to successful applications. However, research on ML methods in reactor physics is somewhat fragmented, and the ability to generalize models needs to be strengthened. Progress is still possible, especially in addressing theoretical challenges and enhancing industrial applications such as building surrogate models and digital twins.</p></details> | 33 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Towards Effective Issue Assignment using Online Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02437v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient issue assignment in software development relates to faster resolution time, resources optimization, and reduced development effort. To this end, numerous systems have been developed to automate issue assignment, including AI and machine learning approaches. Most of them, however, often solely focus on a posteriori analyses of textual features (e.g. issue titles, descriptions), disregarding the temporal characteristics of software development. Thus, they fail to adapt as projects and teams evolve, such cases of team evolution, or project phase shifts (e.g. from development to maintenance). To incorporate such cases in the issue assignment process, we propose an Online Machine Learning methodology that adapts to the evolving characteristics of software projects. Our system processes issues as a data stream, dynamically learning from new data and adjusting in real time to changes in team composition and project requirements. We incorporate metadata such as issue descriptions, components and labels and leverage adaptive drift detection mechanisms to identify when model re-evaluation is necessary. Upon assessing our methodology on a set of software projects, we conclude that it can be effective on issue assignment, while meeting the evolving needs of software teams.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on manually crafted annotations -- labeling functions as sources or sinks -- to track data flows, e.g., ensuring that allocated memory is eventually freed, and code analysis tools such as CodeQL, Infer, or Cooddy can use function specifications, but manual annotation is laborious and error-prone, especially for large or third-party libraries. We present LAMeD (LLM-generated Annotations for Memory leak Detection), a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate function-specific annotations. When integrated with analyzers such as Cooddy, LAMeD significantly improves memory leak detection and reduces path explosion. We also suggest directions for extending LAMeD to broader code analysis.</p></details> |  |

Users can adjust these PID parameters during flight. However, flight control programs lack sufficient safety checks on user-provided PID parameters, leading to a severe UAV vulnerability - the input validation bug. This occurs when a user misconfigures PID parameters, causing dangerous states like deviation from the expected path, loss of control, or crash. Prior works use random testing like fuzzing, but these are not effective in the three-dimensional search space of PID parameters. The expensive dynamic execution of UAV tests further hinders random testing performance. We address PID parameter misconfiguration by combining the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion with coordinate search, introducing RouthSearch. Instead of ad-hoc identification, RouthSearch principledly determines valid ranges for three-dimensional PID parameters. We first leverage the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion to identify a theoretical PID parameter boundary, then refine it using efficient coordinate search. The determined valid range can filter misconfigured PID parameters from users during flight and help discover logical bugs in flight control programs. We evaluated RouthSearch across eight flight modes in PX4 and Ardupilot. Results show RouthSearch determines valid ranges with 92.0% accuracy compared to ground truth. RouthSearch discovers 3,853 PID misconfigurations within 48 hours, while the STOA work PGFuzz discovers only 449 sets, significantly outperforming prior works by 8.58 times. Our method also helped detect three bugs in ArduPilot and PX4.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34rd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce srcVul, a scalable, precise detection approach that combines program slicing with Locality-Sensitive Hashing to identify vulnerable code clones and recommend patches. srcVul builds a database of vulnerability-related slices by analyzing known vulnerable programs and their corresponding patches, indexing each slice's unique structural characteristics as a vulnerability slicing vector. During clone detection, srcVul efficiently matches slicing vectors from target programs with those in the database, recommending patches upon identifying similarities. Our evaluation of srcVul against three state-of-the-art vulnerable clone detectors demonstrates its accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, achieving 91% precision and 75% recall on established vulnerability databases and open-source repositories. These results highlight srcVul's effectiveness in detecting complex vulnerability patterns across diverse codebases.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about performance and energy consumption have led to the development of compilers to enhance Python code efficiency. Despite the proven benefits of existing compilers on the efficiency of Python code, there is limited analysis comparing their performance and energy efficiency, particularly considering code characteristics and factors like CPU frequency and core count. Our study investigates how compilation impacts the performance and energy consumption of Python code, using seven benchmarks compiled with eight different tools: PyPy, Numba, Nuitka, Mypyc, Codon, Cython, Pyston-lite, and the experimental Python 3.13 version, compared to CPython. The benchmarks are single-threaded and executed on an NUC and a server, measuring energy usage, execution time, memory usage, and Last-Level Cache (LLC) miss rates at a fixed frequency and on a single core. The results show that compilation can significantly enhance execution time, energy and memory usage, with Codon, PyPy, and Numba achieving over 90\% speed and energy improvements. Nuitka optimizes memory usage consistently on both testbeds. The impact of compilation on LLC miss rate is not clear since it varies considerably across benchmarks for each compiler. Our study is important for researchers and practitioners focused on improving Python code performance and energy efficiency. We outline future research directions, such as exploring caching effects on energy usage. Our findings help practitioners choose the best compiler based on their efficiency benefits and accessibility.</p></details> |  |

While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.</p></details> |  |

Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 30 figures.

However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.</p></details> |  |

To approach this problem, we present DIFF-FLOOD, a probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting method designed based on denoising diffusion models. DIFF-FLOOD predicts inundation level at a location by taking both spatial and temporal context into account. It utilizes inundation levels at neighboring locations and digital elevation data as spatial context. Inundation history from a context time window, together with additional co-variates are used as temporal context. Convolutional neural networks and cross-attention mechanism are then employed to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested DIFF-FLOOD on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a region highly impacted by coastal flooding. Our results show that, DIFF-FLOOD outperforms existing forecasting methods in terms of prediction performance (6% to 64% improvement in terms of two performance metrics) and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Threshold Modulation for Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05375v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025. \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages) and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Differential Testing With LLMs For Testing Deep Learning Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07944v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by ACM TOSEM.

| **[Scalable Chain of Thoughts via Elastic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05315v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Two-Sample Test of Text Generation Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05269v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in digitized text data requires reliable inferential methods on observed textual patterns. This article proposes a novel two-sample text test for comparing similarity between two groups of documents. The hypothesis is whether the probabilistic mapping generating the textual data is identical across two groups of documents. The proposed test aims to assess text similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set. We showed theoretically that under mild conditions, the test statistic asymptotically follows a normal distribution. A multiple data-splitting strategy is proposed to enhance test power, which combines p-values into a unified decision. Various simulation studies and a real data example demonstrated that the proposed two-sample text test maintains the nominal Type one error rate while offering greater power compared to existing methods. The proposed method provides a novel solution to assert differences in document classes, particularly in fields where large-scale textual information is crucial.</p></details> |  |

To equip resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system. ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design, encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed aerial navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, RSS 2025 Demo track, https://theairlab.org/visafe/</p></details> |
| **[Rejection via Learning Density Ratios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18686v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification with rejection emerges as a learning paradigm which allows models to abstain from making predictions. The predominant approach is to alter the supervised learning pipeline by augmenting typical loss functions, letting model rejection incur a lower loss than an incorrect prediction. Instead, we propose a different distributional perspective, where we seek to find an idealized data distribution which maximizes a pretrained model's performance. This can be formalized via the optimization of a loss's risk with a $\varphi$-divergence regularization term. Through this idealized distribution, a rejection decision can be made by utilizing the density ratio between this distribution and the data distribution. We focus on the setting where our $\varphi$-divergences are specified by the family of $\alpha$-divergence. Our framework is tested empirically over clean and noisy datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compa...</summary><p>Compared to published version, a typo in Appendix Section E has been fixed</p></details> |

To that aim, we generated a database with 996 entries, which includes up to 7 variables regarding both the manufacturing process and environmental conditions for more than 180 days. Then, we relied on a software framework that brings together a conglomeration of automated ML protocols that execute sequentially against our database by simply command-line interface. This easily permits hyper-optimizing and randomizing seeds of the ML models through exhaustive benchmarking so that optimal models are obtained. The accuracy achieved reaches values of the coefficient determination (R2) widely exceeding 0.90, whereas the root mean squared error (RMSE), sum of squared error (SSE), and mean absolute error (MAE)>1% of the target value, the PCE. Additionally, we contribute with validated models able to screen the behavior of OSCs never seen in the database. In that case, R2~0.96-0.97 and RMSE~1%, thus confirming the reliability of the proposal to predict. For comparative purposes, classical Bayesian regression fitting based on non-linear mean squares (LMS) are also presented, which only perform sufficiently for univariate cases of single OSCs. Hence they fail to outperform the breadth of the capabilities shown by the ML models. Finally, thanks to the standardized results offered by the ML framework, we study the dependencies between the variables of the dataset and their implications for the optimal performance and stability of the OSCs. Reproducibility is ensured by a standardized report altogether with the dataset, which are publicly available at Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Symbolic World Models via Test-time Scaling of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04728v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving complex planning problems requires Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly model the state transition to avoid rule violations, comply with constraints, and ensure optimality-a task hindered by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50\% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR2025 (32 pages, 6 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Jailbreaking and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15236v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by advancing natural language understanding and generation, enabling applications across fields beyond healthcare, software engineering, and conversational systems. Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latte: Transfering LLMs` Latent-level Knowledge for Few-shot Tabular Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05237v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot tabular learning, in which machine learning models are trained with a limited amount of labeled data, provides a cost-effective approach to addressing real-world challenges. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain</p></details> |  |

To support advancements in chemistry-focused natural language processing (NLP), we present ChemRxivQuest, a curated dataset of 970 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs derived from 155 ChemRxiv preprints across 17 subfields of chemistry. Each QA pair is explicitly linked to its source text segment to ensure traceability and contextual accuracy. ChemRxivQuest was constructed using an automated pipeline that combines optical character recognition (OCR), GPT-4o-based QA generation, and a fuzzy matching technique for answer verification. The dataset emphasizes conceptual, mechanistic, applied, and experimental questions, enabling applications in retrieval-based QA systems, search engine development, and fine-tuning of domain-adapted large language models. We analyze the dataset's structure, coverage, and limitations, and outline future directions for expansion and expert validation. ChemRxivQuest provides a foundational resource for chemistry NLP research, education, and tool development.</p></details> |  |

We propose MaxUCB, a max $k$-armed bandit method to trade off exploring different model classes and conducting hyperparameter optimization. MaxUCB is specifically designed for the light-tailed and bounded reward distributions arising in this setting and, thus, provides an efficient alternative compared to classic max $k$-armed bandit methods assuming heavy-tailed reward distributions. We theoretically and empirically evaluate our method on four standard AutoML benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over prior approaches.</p></details> |  |

This assumption often fails under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization. To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

These physical constraints cannot be fully addressed through advancements in control algorithms alone. Drawing inspiration from the winged flying squirrel, this paper proposes a highly maneuverable drone equipped with agility-enhancing foldable wings. By leveraging collaborative control between the conventional propeller system and the foldable wings-coordinated through the Thrust-Wing Coordination Control (TWCC) framework-the controllable acceleration set is expanded, enabling the generation of abrupt vertical forces that are unachievable with traditional wingless drones. The complex aerodynamics of the foldable wings are modeled using a physics-assisted recurrent neural network (paRNN), which calibrates the angle of attack (AOA) to align with the real aerodynamic behavior of the wings. The additional air resistance generated by appropriately deploying these wings significantly improves the tracking performance of the proposed "flying squirrel" drone. The model is trained on real flight data and incorporates flat-plate aerodynamic principles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed flying squirrel drone achieves a 13.1% improvement in tracking performance, as measured by root mean square error (RMSE), compared to a conventional wingless drone.

Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local linear Fréchet curve regression in manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05168v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Fr\'echet functional regression has been recently addressed from time correlated bivariate curve data evaluated in a manifold (see Torres et al. 2025). For this type of curve data sets, the present paper solves the problem of local linear approximation of the Fr\'echet conditional mean in an extrinsic and intrinsic way. The extrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression predictor is obtained in the time varying tangent space by projection into an orthornormal basis of the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\'echet mean approach is adopted in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is also proved. The performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and intrinsic functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\'echet curve predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. The finite-sample size properties are also tested in a real-data application via cross-validation. Specifically, functional prediction of the magnetic vector field from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft is addressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not Another Imputation Method: A Transformer-based Model for Missing Values in Tabular Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11540v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling missing values in tabular datasets presents a significant challenge in training and testing artificial intelligence models, an issue usually addressed using imputation techniques. Here we introduce "Not Another Imputation Method" (NAIM), a novel transformer-based model specifically designed to address this issue without the need for traditional imputation techniques. NAIM's ability to avoid the necessity of imputing missing values and to effectively learn from available data relies on two main techniques: the use of feature-specific embeddings to encode both categorical and numerical features also handling missing inputs; the modification of the masked self-attention mechanism to completely mask out the contributions of missing data. Additionally, a novel regularization technique is introduced to enhance the model's generalization capability from incomplete data. We extensively evaluated NAIM on 5 publicly available tabular datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over 6 state-of-the-art machine learning models and 5 deep learning models, each paired with 3 different imputation techniques when necessary. The results highlight the efficacy of NAIM in improving predictive performance and resilience in the presence of missing data. To facilitate further research and practical application in handling missing data without traditional imputation methods, we made the code for NAIM available at https://github.com/cosbidev/NAIM.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Data Representation Learning for Non-parametric Two-sample Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00613v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective data representations has been crucial in non-parametric two-sample testing. Common approaches will first split data into training and test sets and then learn data representations purely on the training set. However, recent theoretical studies have shown that, as long as the sample indexes are not used during the learning process, the whole data can be used to learn data representations, meanwhile ensuring control of Type-I errors. The above fact motivates us to use the test set (but without sample indexes) to facilitate the data representation learning in the testing. To this end, we propose a representation-learning two-sample testing (RL-TST) framework. RL-TST first performs purely self-supervised representation learning on the entire dataset to capture inherent representations (IRs) that reflect the underlying data manifold. A discriminative model is then trained on these IRs to learn discriminative representations (DRs), enabling the framework to leverage both the rich structural information from IRs and the discriminative power of DRs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-TST outperforms representative approaches by simultaneously using data manifold information in the test set and enhancing test power via finding the DRs with the training set.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures.

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms effectively help designers identify trade-offs among the desired non-functional properties. To reduce the use of computational resources, this work examines the impact of implementing a search budget to limit the search for design alternatives. In particular, we analyze how time budgets affect the quality of Pareto fronts by utilizing quality indicators and exploring the structural features of the generated design alternatives. This study identifies distinct behavioral differences among evolutionary algorithms when a search budget is implemented. It further reveals that design alternatives generated under a budget are structurally different from those produced without one. Additionally, we offer recommendations for designers on selecting algorithms in relation to time constraints, thereby facilitating the effective application of automated refactoring to improve non-functional properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.08385</p></details> |

While Differential Privacy (DP) is the gold standard for protecting user privacy, standard DP mechanisms typically significantly impair performance. One approach to mitigating this issue is pre-training models on simulated data before DP learning on the private data. In this work we go a step further, using simulated data to train a meta-learning model that combines the Convolutional Conditional Neural Process (ConvCNP) with an improved functional DP mechanism of Hall et al. [2013] yielding the DPConvCNP. DPConvCNP learns from simulated data how to map private data to a DP predictive model in one forward pass, and then provides accurate, well-calibrated predictions. We compare DPConvCNP with a DP Gaussian Process (GP) baseline with carefully tuned hyperparameters. The DPConvCNP outperforms the GP baseline, especially on non-Gaussian data, yet is much faster at test time and requires less tuning.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[ItDPDM: Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05082v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while also achieving faster convergence.</p></details> | Pre-print |

This makes full automation with learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85% improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover, performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Methods, and Applications to Circuit Design (SMACD 2025). 4 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Learning from Similarity Proportion Loss for Classifying Skeletal Muscle Recovery Stages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04150v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the regeneration process of damaged muscle tissue is a fundamental analysis in muscle research to measure experimental effect sizes and uncover mechanisms behind muscle weakness due to aging and disease. The conventional approach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging and expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological information of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with automated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a quantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully labeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a weakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However, current LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature extractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing recovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the loss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale Learning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion loss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor by using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our model with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in classification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI2024 workshop ADSMI in Morocco (oral) [Peer-reviewed]</p></details> |
| **[Accurate and Diverse LLM Mathematical Reasoning via Automated PRM-Guided GFlowNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19981v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Power of Stories: Narrative Priming Shapes How LLM Agents Collaborate and Compete](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03961v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>According to Yuval Noah Harari, large-scale human cooperation is driven by shared narratives that encode common beliefs and values. This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

Multi-LLM Repeated Sampling Efficiently Scales Test-Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00762v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[G-FOCUS: Towards a Robust Method for Assessing UI Design Persuasiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05026v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS, a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released publicly.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |

While some studies manually assess these anomalies and describe the ribs qualitatively, this study aims to automate thoracolumbar stump rib detection and analyze their morphology quantitatively. To this end, we train a high-resolution deep-learning model for rib segmentation and show significant improvements compared to existing models (Dice score 0.997 vs. 0.779, p-value < 0.01). In addition, we use an iterative algorithm and piece-wise linear interpolation to assess the length of the ribs, showing a success rate of 98.2%. When analyzing morphological features, we show that stump ribs articulate more posteriorly at the vertebrae (-19.2 +- 3.8 vs -13.8 +- 2.5, p-value < 0.01), are thinner (260.6 +- 103.4 vs. 563.6 +- 127.1, p-value < 0.01), and are oriented more downwards and sideways within the first centimeters in contrast to full-length ribs. We show that with partially visible ribs, these features can achieve an F1-score of 0.84 in differentiating stump ribs from regular ones. We publish the model weights and masks for public use.</p></details> |  |

We present Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates complex OpenFOAM-based CFD simulation workflows from natural language inputs. Our innovation includes (1) a hierarchical multi-index retrieval system with specialized indices for different simulation aspects, (2) a dependency-aware file generation system that provides consistency management across configuration files, and (3) an iterative error correction mechanism that diagnoses and resolves simulation failures without human intervention. Through comprehensive evaluation on the dataset of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 83.6% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM and 37.3% for OpenFOAM-GPT). Ablation studies demonstrate the critical contribution of each system component, with the specialized error correction mechanism providing a 36.4% performance improvement. Foam-Agent substantially lowers the CFD expertise threshold while maintaining modeling accuracy, demonstrating the potential of specialized multi-agent systems to democratize access to complex scientific simulation tools.

However, existing AI-based regulation techniques are often tailored to specific application domains and thus are difficult to generalize in an automated manner. This paper presents Horae, a unified specification language for modeling (multimodal) regulation rules across a diverse set of domains. We showcase how Horae facilitates an intelligent service regulation pipeline by further exploiting a fine-tuned large language model named RuleGPT that automates the Horae modeling process, thereby yielding an end-to-end framework for fully automated intelligent service regulation. The feasibility and effectiveness of our framework are demonstrated over a benchmark of various real-world regulation domains. In particular, we show that our open-sourced, fine-tuned RuleGPT with 7B parameters suffices to outperform GPT-3.5 and perform on par with GPT-4o.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, this exchangeability is compromised when some entries of the test feature are contaminated, such as in the case of cellwise outliers. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel framework called detect-then-impute conformal prediction. This framework first employs an outlier detection procedure on the test feature and then utilizes an imputation method to fill in those cells identified as outliers. To quantify the uncertainty in the processed test feature, we adaptively apply the detection and imputation procedures to the calibration set, thereby constructing exchangeable features for the conformal prediction interval of the test label. We develop two practical algorithms, PDI-CP and JDI-CP, and provide a distribution-free coverage analysis under some commonly used detection and imputation procedures. Notably, JDI-CP achieves a finite sample $1-2\alpha$ coverage guarantee. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms exhibit robust coverage properties and comparable efficiency to the oracle baseline.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |
| **[LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments: When Should We Ask LLMs for Help?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06877v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test collections are information retrieval tools that allow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate ranking algorithms. While test collections have become an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves significant effort in manual annotations, which often makes it very expensive and time-consuming. Thus, test collections could become too small when the budget is limited, which may lead to unstable evaluations. As a cheaper alternative, recent studies have proposed the use of large language models (LLMs) to completely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs seem to somewhat correlate with human judgments, their predictions are not perfect and often show bias. Thus a complete replacement with LLMs is argued to be too risky and not fully reliable. Thus, in this paper, we propose LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments (LARA), an effective method to balance manual annotations with LLM annotations, which helps to build a rich and reliable test collection even under a low budget. We use the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities to select the most profitable documents to manually annotate under a budget constraint. With theoretical reasoning, LARA effectively guides the human annotation process by actively learning to calibrate the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities. Then, using the calibration model learned from the limited manual annotations, LARA debiases the LLM predictions to annotate the remaining non-assessed data. Empirical evaluations on TREC-7 Ad Hoc, TREC-8 Ad Hoc, TREC Robust 2004, and TREC-COVID datasets show that LARA outperforms alternative solutions under almost any budget constraint.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

By attaching the contents of ReadMe$.$LLM to a query, performance consistently improves to near-perfect accuracy, with one case study demonstrating up to 100% success across all tested models. We propose a software development lifecycle where LLM-specific documentation is maintained alongside traditional software updates. In this study, we present two practical applications of the ReadMe$.$LLM idea with diverse software libraries, highlighting that our proposed approach could generalize across programming domains.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |

These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeIF-Bench: Evaluating Instruction-Following Capabilities of Large Language Models in Interactive Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22688v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in code generation tasks and have become indispensable programming assistants for developers. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.</p></details> |  |

However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as captions or mathematical formulas, remains largely untested, posing significant challenges for applications requiring exact textual accuracy. In this work, we introduce T2VTextBench, the first human-evaluation benchmark dedicated to evaluating on-screen text fidelity and temporal consistency in text-to-video models. Our suite of prompts integrates complex text strings with dynamic scene changes, testing each model's ability to maintain detailed instructions across frames. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art systems, ranging from open-source solutions to commercial offerings, and find that most struggle to generate legible, consistent text. These results highlight a critical gap in current video generators and provide a clear direction for future research aimed at enhancing textual manipulation in video synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Neurodivergence as a Contingent Solution to the AI Alignment Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02581v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about control and existential risk have escalated. Here, we investigate whether embracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a dynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more human-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in this contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce and test change-of-opinion attacks based on this kind of perturbation and intervention analysis to study how agents may neutralise friendly or unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that open models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in proprietary models are successful at steering and controlling to some extent the agents' range of opinion and sentiment change with possible positive and negative consequences in what we believe are signs of a neuro-symbolic approach even if shallow.</p></details> | 45 pages |

| **[Regularized Robustly Reliable Learners and Instance Targeted Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10572v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance-targeted data poisoning attacks, where an adversary corrupts a training set to induce errors on specific test points, have raised significant concerns. Balcan et al (2022) proposed an approach to addressing this challenge by defining a notion of robustly-reliable learners that provide per-instance guarantees of correctness under well-defined assumptions, even in the presence of data poisoning attacks. They then give a generic optimal (but computationally inefficient) robustly reliable learner as well as a computationally efficient algorithm for the case of linear separators over log-concave distributions. In this work, we address two challenges left open by Balcan et al (2022). The first is that the definition of robustly-reliable learners in Balcan et al (2022) becomes vacuous for highly-flexible hypothesis classes: if there are two classifiers h_0, h_1 \in H both with zero error on the training set such that h_0(x) \neq h_1(x), then a robustly-reliable learner must abstain on x. We address this problem by defining a modified notion of regularized robustly-reliable learners that allows for nontrivial statements in this case. The second is that the generic algorithm of Balcan et al (2022) requires re-running an ERM oracle (essentially, retraining the classifier) on each test point x, which is generally impractical even if ERM can be implemented efficiently. To tackle this problem, we show that at least in certain interesting cases we can design algorithms that can produce their outputs in time sublinear in training time, by using techniques from dynamic algorithm design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Evaluation of DeepSeek Models in Chinese Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11137v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the DeepSeek series of models, leveraging their exceptional reasoning capabilities and open-source strategy, is reshaping the global AI landscape. Despite these advantages, they exhibit significant safety deficiencies. Research conducted by Robust Intelligence, a subsidiary of Cisco, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that DeepSeek-R1 has a 100\% attack success rate when processing harmful prompts. Additionally, multiple safety companies and research institutions have confirmed critical safety vulnerabilities in this model. As models demonstrating robust performance in Chinese and English, DeepSeek models require equally crucial safety assessments in both language contexts. However, current research has predominantly focused on safety evaluations in English environments, leaving a gap in comprehensive assessments of their safety performance in Chinese contexts. In response to this gap, this study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a Chinese-specific safety evaluation benchmark. This benchmark systematically evaluates the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese contexts, revealing their performance across safety categories. The experimental results quantify the deficiencies of these two models in Chinese contexts, providing key insights for subsequent improvements. It should be noted that, despite our efforts to establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation benchmark, the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution, and the setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases into the evaluation results. We will continuously optimize the evaluation benchmark and periodically update this report to provide more comprehensive and accurate assessment outcomes.

Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems. Our findings underscore the potential of dynamic retrieval-based methods to bridge the gap between global LLM capabilities and localized cultural values.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[PR2: Peephole Raw Pointer Rewriting with LLMs for Translating C to Safer Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04852v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.</p></details> |  |

However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE 4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE CAI Workshop on Adaptive Cyber Defense 2025.

This hinders test-time compute scaling that relies on using the value-function for verification. In this work, we propose RL$^V$ that augments any ``value-free'' RL method by jointly training the LLM as both a reasoner and a generative verifier using RL-generated data, adding verification capabilities without significant overhead. Empirically, RL$^V$ boosts MATH accuracy by over 20\% with parallel sampling and enables $8-32\times$ efficient test-time compute scaling compared to the base RL method. RL$^V$ also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for both easy-to-hard and out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, RL$^V$ achieves $1.2-1.6\times$ higher performance when jointly scaling parallel and sequential test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model.</p></details> |  |

However, their privacy guarantees are only considered robust when models satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Alas, this is not a ubiquitous standard, as many leading companies (and, in fact, research papers) use ad-hoc privacy metrics based on testing the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we examine the privacy metrics used in real-world synthetic data deployments and demonstrate their unreliability in several ways. First, we provide counter-examples where severe privacy violations occur even if the privacy tests pass and instantiate accurate membership and attribute inference attacks with minimal cost. We then introduce ReconSyn, a reconstruction attack that generates multiple synthetic datasets that are considered private by the metrics but actually leak information unique to individual records. We show that ReconSyn recovers 78-100% of the outliers in the train data with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics. In the process, we show that applying DP only to the model does not mitigate this attack, as using privacy metrics breaks the end-to-end DP pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 46th IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy (IEEE S&P 2025).

| **[Quantum-Inspired Optimization Process for Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04841v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data imputation is a critical step in data pre-processing, particularly for datasets with missing or unreliable values. This study introduces a novel quantum-inspired imputation framework evaluated on the UCI Diabetes dataset, which contains biologically implausible missing values across several clinical features. The method integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with quantum-assisted rotations, optimized through gradient-free classical optimizers -COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution to reconstruct missing values while preserving statistical fidelity. Reconstructed values are constrained within +/-2 standard deviations of original feature distributions, avoiding unrealistic clustering around central tendencies. This approach achieves a substantial and statistically significant improvement, including an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values between 0.18 and 0.22, compared to p-values > 0.99 in classical methods such as Mean, KNN, and MICE. The method also eliminates zero-value artifacts and enhances the realism and variability of imputed data. By combining quantum-inspired transformations with a scalable classical framework, this methodology provides a robust solution for imputation tasks in domains such as healthcare and AI pipelines, where data quality and integrity are crucial.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Practical Theory of Generalization in Selectivity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07014v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query-driven machine learning models have emerged as a promising estimation technique for query selectivities. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the efficacy of these techniques from a theoretical perspective, as there exist substantial gaps between practical solutions and state-of-the-art (SOTA) theory based on the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gaps between theory and practice. First, we demonstrate that selectivity predictors induced by signed measures are learnable, which relaxes the reliance on probability measures in SOTA theory. More importantly, beyond the PAC learning framework (which only allows us to characterize how the model behaves when both training and test workloads are drawn from the same distribution), we establish, under mild assumptions, that selectivity predictors from this class exhibit favorable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization error bounds. These theoretical advances provide us with a better understanding of both the in-distribution and OOD generalization capabilities of query-driven selectivity learning, and facilitate the design of two general strategies to improve OOD generalization for existing query-driven selectivity models. We empirically verify that our techniques help query-driven selectivity models generalize significantly better to OOD queries both in terms of prediction accuracy and query latency performance, while maintaining their superior in-distribution generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

This has led to the emergence of AI for Software Engineering as a distinct research area within software engineering. With the development of quantum computing, the field of Quantum AI (QAI) is arising, enhancing the performance of classical AI and holding significant potential for solving classical software engineering problems. Some initial applications of QAI in software engineering have already emerged, such as software test optimization. However, the path ahead remains open, offering ample opportunities to solve complex software engineering problems with QAI cost-effectively.

However, these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak, an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational systems.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Information-Theoretic Generalization Bounds for Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03176v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit an exceptional capacity for generalization in practical applications. This work aims to capture the effect and benefits of depth for supervised learning via information-theoretic generalization bounds. We first derive two hierarchical bounds on the generalization error in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or the 1-Wasserstein distance between the train and test distributions of the network internal representations. The KL divergence bound shrinks as the layer index increases, while the Wasserstein bound implies the existence of a layer that serves as a generalization funnel, which attains a minimal 1-Wasserstein distance. Analytic expressions for both bounds are derived under the setting of binary Gaussian classification with linear DNNs. To quantify the contraction of the relevant information measures when moving deeper into the network, we analyze the strong data processing inequality (SDPI) coefficient between consecutive layers of three regularized DNN models: $\mathsf{Dropout}$, $\mathsf{DropConnect}$, and Gaussian noise injection. This enables refining our generalization bounds to capture the contraction as a function of the network architecture parameters. Specializing our results to DNNs with a finite parameter space and the Gibbs algorithm reveals that deeper yet narrower network architectures generalize better in those examples, although how broadly this statement applies remains a question.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Communicating Activations Between Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14082v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication between multiple language model (LM) agents has been shown to scale up the reasoning ability of LMs. While natural language has been the dominant medium for inter-LM communication, it is not obvious this should be the standard: not only does natural language communication incur high inference costs that scale quickly with the number of both agents and messages, but also the decoding process abstracts away too much rich information that could be otherwise accessed from the internal activations. In this work, we propose a simple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause an LM $\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current activation with another LM $\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some function $\textit{f}$, then pass $\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of $\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete. This approach scales up LMs on new tasks with zero additional parameters and data, and saves a substantial amount of compute over natural language communication. We test our method with various functional forms $\textit{f}$ on two experimental setups--multi-player coordination games and reasoning benchmarks--and find that it achieves up to $27.0\%$ improvement over natural language communication across datasets with $<$$1/4$ the compute, illustrating the superiority and robustness of activations as an alternative "language" for communication between LMs.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Learning to Compare Hardware Designs for High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13138v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) is an automated design process that transforms high-level code into hardware designs, enabling the rapid development of hardware accelerators. HLS relies on pragmas, which are directives inserted into the source code to guide the synthesis process, and pragmas have various settings and values that significantly impact the resulting hardware design. State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the model, and return the top designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways. To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. CompareXplore introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel node difference attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enabling the model to identify critical pragmas impacting performance. CompareXplore adopts a two-stage DSE, where a pointwise prediction model is used for the initial design pruning, followed by a pairwise comparison stage for precise performance verification. In extensive experiments, compareXplore achieves significant improvements in ranking metrics and generates high-quality HLS results for the selected designs, outperforming the existing SOTA method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in MLCAD 2024</p></details> |

The Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) method aims to make data unlearnable by applying class-wise blurs to every image in the dataset so that neural networks learn relations between blur kernels and labels, as opposed to informative features for classifying clean data. In this work, we evaluate whether CUDA data remains unlearnable after image sharpening and frequency filtering, finding that this combination of simple transforms improves the utility of CUDA data for training. In particular, we observe a substantial increase in test accuracy over adversarial training for models trained with CUDA unlearnable data from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100. In training models to high accuracy using unlearnable data, we underscore the need for ongoing refinement in data poisoning techniques to ensure data privacy. Our method opens new avenues for enhancing the robustness of unlearnable datasets by highlighting that simple methods such as sharpening and frequency filtering are capable of breaking convolution-based unlearnable datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop at NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Conformal Prediction with Corrupted Labels: Uncertain Imputation and Robust Re-weighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04733v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework for robust uncertainty quantification in situations where labeled training data are corrupted, through noisy or missing labels. We build on conformal prediction, a statistical tool for generating prediction sets that cover the test label with a pre-specified probability. The validity of conformal prediction, however, holds under the i.i.d assumption, which does not hold in our setting due to the corruptions in the data. To account for this distribution shift, the privileged conformal prediction (PCP) method proposed leveraging privileged information (PI) -- additional features available only during training -- to re-weight the data distribution, yielding valid prediction sets under the assumption that the weights are accurate. In this work, we analyze the robustness of PCP to inaccuracies in the weights. Our analysis indicates that PCP can still yield valid uncertainty estimates even when the weights are poorly estimated. Furthermore, we introduce uncertain imputation (UI), a new conformal method that does not rely on weight estimation. Instead, we impute corrupted labels in a way that preserves their uncertainty. Our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees and validated empirically on both synthetic and real benchmarks. Finally, we show that these techniques can be integrated into a triply robust framework, ensuring statistically valid predictions as long as at least one underlying method is valid.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guaranteed Recovery of Unambiguous Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13093v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the $K$-clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, includes minor changes and some new content compared to previous version</p></details> |

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Two Sample Testing to Singular Gaussian Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04613v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish that testing for the equality of two probability measures on a general separable and compact metric space is equivalent to testing for the singularity between two corresponding Gaussian measures on a suitable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. The corresponding Gaussians are defined via the notion of kernel mean and covariance embedding of a probability measure. Discerning two singular Gaussians is fundamentally simpler from an information-theoretic perspective than non-parametric two-sample testing, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Our proof leverages the Feldman-Hajek criterion for singularity/equivalence of Gaussians on Hilbert spaces, and shows that discrepancies between distributions are heavily magnified through their corresponding Gaussian embeddings: at a population level, distinct probability measures lead to essentially separated Gaussian embeddings. This appears to be a new instance of the blessing of dimensionality that can be harnessed for the design of efficient inference tools in great generality.</p></details> |  |

Statistical methods for nonparametric change-point detection -- especially the tools of conformal test martingales (CTMs) and anytime-valid inference -- offer promising approaches to this monitoring task. However, existing methods are restricted to monitoring limited hypothesis classes or ``alarm criteria,'' such as data shifts that violate certain exchangeability assumptions, or do not allow for online adaptation in response to shifts. In this paper, we expand the scope of these monitoring methods by proposing a weighted generalization of conformal test martingales (WCTMs), which lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring for any unexpected changepoints in the data distribution while controlling false-alarms. For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms that accommodate online adaptation to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input distribution) while raising alarms in response to more severe shifts, such as concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme (out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to. On real-world datasets, we demonstrate improved performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2025</p></details> |

This is the first tight bound for testing a natural class of Boolean functions in the distribution-free sample-based model. Our bounds also hold for the feature selection problem, showing that a junta tester must learn the set of relevant variables. For tolerant junta testing, we prove a sample lower bound of $\Omega(2^{(1-o(1)) k} + \log\binom{n}{k})$ showing that, unlike standard testing, there is no large gap between tolerant testing and learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional numerical methods struggle with the exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic domains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with dimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net, an efficient neural surrogate that overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high dimensions. Unlike hyperspheres, where the internal volume diminishes as dimensionality increases, hypercubes retain or expand their volume (for unit or larger length), making high-dimensional computations significantly more demanding. Anant-Net efficiently incorporates high-dimensional boundary conditions and minimizes the PDE residual at high-dimensional collocation points. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold networks into the Anant-Net architecture. We benchmark Anant-Net's performance on several linear and nonlinear high-dimensional equations, including the Poisson, Sine-Gordon, and Allen-Cahn equations, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across randomly sampled test points from high-dimensional space. Importantly, Anant-Net achieves these results with remarkable efficiency, solving 300-dimensional problems on a single GPU within a few hours. We also compare Anant-Net's results for accuracy and runtime with other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings establish Anant-Net as an accurate, interpretable, and scalable framework for efficiently solving high-dimensional PDEs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |

Leveraging historical public health data from DataSUS (2017-2023), the proposed model concurrently performs binary classification (outbreak detection) and regression (case forecasting) tasks. A sliding window strategy was adopted to construct temporal features using varying input lengths (60, 90, and 120 days), with hyperparameter optimization carried out using Keras Tuner. Model evaluation used time series cross-validation for robustness and a held-out test from 2023 for generalization assessment. The results show that longer windows improve dengue regression accuracy, while classification performance peaked at intermediate windows, suggesting an optimal trade-off between sequence length and generalization. The multitask architecture delivers competitive performance across diseases and tasks, demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of unified modeling strategies for scalable epidemic forecasting in data-limited public health scenarios.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Boosting Masked ECG-Text Auto-Encoders as Discriminative Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02131v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate interpretation of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is pivotal for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Integrating ECG signals with accompanying textual reports further holds immense potential to enhance clinical diagnostics by combining physiological data and qualitative insights. However, this integration faces significant challenges due to inherent modality disparities and the scarcity of labeled data for robust cross-modal learning. To address these obstacles, we propose D-BETA, a novel framework that pre-trains ECG and text data using a contrastive masked auto-encoder architecture. D-BETA uniquely combines the strengths of generative with boosted discriminative capabilities to achieve robust cross-modal representations. This is accomplished through masked modality modeling, specialized loss functions, and an improved negative sampling strategy tailored for cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on five public datasets across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that D-BETA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving an average AUC improvement of 15% in linear probing with only one percent of training data and 2% in zero-shot performance without requiring training data over state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the effectiveness of D-BETA, underscoring its potential to advance automated clinical diagnostics through multi-modal representations.

Unfortunately, existing methods for matrix completion are heuristics that, while highly scalable and often identifying high-quality solutions, do not possess any optimality guarantees. We reexamine matrix completion with an optimality-oriented eye. We reformulate low-rank matrix completion problems as convex problems over the non-convex set of projection matrices and implement a disjunctive branch-and-bound scheme that solves them to certifiable optimality. Further, we derive a novel and often near-exact class of convex relaxations by decomposing a low-rank matrix as a sum of rank-one matrices and incentivizing that two-by-two minors in each rank-one matrix have determinant zero. In numerical experiments, our new convex relaxations decrease the optimality gap by two orders of magnitude compared to existing attempts, and our disjunctive branch-and-bound scheme solves $n \times m$ rank-$r$ matrix completion problems to certifiable optimality or near optimality in hours for $\max \{m, n\} \leq 2500$ and $r \leq 5$. Moreover, this improvement in the training error translates into an average $2\%$--$50\%$ improvement in the test set error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with new numerics showcasing scalability up to n=2500</p></details> |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset.

| **[Spectral and Temporal Denoising for Differentially Private Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04468v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of preserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model utility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering to enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to concentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components, preserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. With a per-iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates improved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy guarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced noise and controlled bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves neural network generalization by optimizing the worst-case loss within a neighborhood of parameters, yet it perturbs parameters using the entire gradient vector, including components with low statistical significance. We introduce ZSharp, a refined sharpness-aware optimization method that incorporates layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering. This process selects only the most statistically significant gradient components-those with large standardized magnitudes-for constructing the perturbation direction. ZSharp retains the standard two-phase SAM structure of ascent and descent while modifying the ascent step to focus on sharper, curvature-relevant directions. We evaluate ZSharp on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using a range of models including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers. Across all architectures and datasets, ZSharp consistently achieves higher test accuracy compared to SAM, ASAM, and Friendly-SAM. These results indicate that Z-score-based gradient filtering can enhance the sharpness sensitivity of the update direction, leading to improved generalization in deep neural network training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effectively Leveraging Execution Traces for Program Repair with Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04441v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising performance on various programming tasks, including Automatic Program Repair (APR). However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Checkification: A Practical Approach for Testing Static Analysis Truths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12093v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis is an essential component of many modern software development tools. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing complexity of static analyzers makes their coding error-prone. Even analysis tools based on rigorous mathematical techniques, such as abstract interpretation, are not immune to bugs. Ensuring the correctness and reliability of software analyzers is critical if they are to be inserted in production compilers and development environments. While compiler validation has seen notable success, formal validation of static analysis tools remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for testing abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Broadly, it consists in checking, over a suite of benchmarks, that the properties inferred statically are satisfied dynamically. The main advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity, which stems directly from framing it within the Ciao assertion-based validation framework, and its blended static/dynamic assertion checking approach. We demonstrate that in this setting, the analysis can be tested with little effort by combining the following components already present in the framework: 1) the static analyzer, which outputs its results as the original program source with assertions interspersed; 2) the assertion run-time checking mechanism, which instruments a program to ensure that no assertion is violated at run time; 3) the random test case generator, which generates random test cases satisfying the properties present in assertion preconditions; and 4) the unit-test framework, which executes those test cases. We have applied our approach to the CiaoPP static analyzer, resulting in the identification of many bugs with reasonable overhead. Most of these bugs have been either fixed or confirmed, helping us detect a range of errors not only related to analysis soundness but also within other aspects of the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

Existing solutions typically rely on two-stage retrieval or indirect modeling paradigms, incuring upstream-downstream inconsistency and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for GPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism for stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with lightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic complexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training with mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the fully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based dense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising and e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness and industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at more than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recognizing Ornaments in Vocal Indian Art Music with Active Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04419v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ornamentations, embellishments, or microtonal inflections are essential to melodic expression across many musical traditions, adding depth, nuance, and emotional impact to performances. Recognizing ornamentations in singing voices is key to MIR, with potential applications in music pedagogy, singer identification, genre classification, and controlled singing voice generation. However, the lack of annotated datasets and specialized modeling approaches remains a major obstacle for progress in this research area. In this work, we introduce R\=aga Ornamentation Detection (ROD), a novel dataset comprising Indian classical music recordings curated by expert musicians. The dataset is annotated using a custom Human-in-the-Loop tool for six vocal ornaments marked as event-based labels. Using this dataset, we develop an ornamentation detection model based on deep time-series analysis, preserving ornament boundaries during the chunking of long audio recordings. We conduct experiments using different train-test configurations within the ROD dataset and also evaluate our approach on a separate, manually annotated dataset of Indian classical concert recordings. Our experimental results support the superior performance of our proposed approach over the baseline CRNN.</p></details> |  |

Typically, the performance of LLMs is measured on benchmarks with small or medium-sized context windows of thousands of lines of code. At the same time, in real-world software projects, repositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by contributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The benchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large repositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of functions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies, docstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper presents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at function body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not covered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large repositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC. Third, we contribute a scalable evaluation pipeline for efficient computing of the target metrics and a tool for visual analysis of generated code. Overall, these three aspects allow for evaluating code generation in large repositories in C and C++.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at LLM4Code 2025 Workshop co-located wtih ICSE 2025</p></details> |

Unlike standard summation neurons, product units enable multiplicative feature interactions, potentially offering a more powerful representation of complex patterns. PURe replaces conventional convolutional layers with 2D product units in the second layer of each residual block, eliminating nonlinear activation functions to preserve structural information. We validate PURe on three benchmark datasets. On Galaxy10 DECaLS, PURe34 achieves the highest test accuracy of 84.89%, surpassing the much deeper ResNet152, while converging nearly five times faster and demonstrating strong robustness to Poisson noise. On ImageNet, PURe architectures outperform standard ResNet models at similar depths, with PURe34 achieving a top-1 accuracy of 80.27% and top-5 accuracy of 95.78%, surpassing deeper ResNet variants (ResNet50, ResNet101) while utilizing significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. On CIFAR-10, PURe consistently outperforms ResNet variants across varying depths, with PURe272 reaching 95.01% test accuracy, comparable to ResNet1001 but at less than half the model size. These results demonstrate that PURe achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Compared to traditional residual networks, PURe not only achieves competitive classification performance with faster convergence and fewer parameters, but also demonstrates greater robustness to noise. Its effectiveness across diverse datasets highlights the potential of product-unit-based architectures for scalable and reliable deep learning in computer vision.</p></details> |  |

| **[Consensus-Aware AV Behavior: Trade-offs Between Safety, Interaction, and Performance in Mixed Urban Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04379v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transportation systems have long been shaped by complexity and heterogeneity, driven by the interdependency of agent actions and traffic outcomes. The deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) in such systems introduces a new challenge: achieving consensus across safety, interaction quality, and traffic performance. In this work, we position consensus as a fundamental property of the traffic system and aim to quantify it. We use high-resolution trajectory data from the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) dataset to empirically analyze AV and human-driven vehicle (HDV) behavior at a signalized urban intersection and around vulnerable road users (VRUs). Key metrics, including Time-to-Collision (TTC), Post-Encroachment Time (PET), deceleration patterns, headways, and string stability, are evaluated across the three performance dimensions. Results show that full consensus across safety, interaction, and performance is rare, with only 1.63% of AV-VRU interaction frames meeting all three conditions. These findings highlight the need for AV models that explicitly balance multi-dimensional performance in mixed-traffic environments. Full reproducibility is supported via our open-source codebase on https://github.com/wissamkontar/Consensus-AV-Analysis.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Extending a Quantum Reinforcement Learning Exploration Policy with Flags to Connect Four](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04371v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action selection based on flags is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) exploration policy that improves the exploration of the state space through the use of flags, which can identify the most promising actions to take in each state. The quantum counterpart of this exploration policy further improves upon this by taking advantage of a quadratic speedup for sampling flagged actions. This approach has already been successfully employed for the game of Checkers. In this work, we describe the application of this method to the context of Connect Four, in order to study its performance in a different setting, which can lead to a better generalization of the technique. We also kept track of a metric that wasn't taken into account in previous work: the average number of iterations to obtain a flagged action. Since going second is a significant disadvantage in Connect Four, we also had the intent of exploring how this more complex scenario would impact the performance of our approach. The experiments involved training and testing classical and quantum RL agents that played either going first or going second against a Randomized Negamax opponent. The results showed that both flagged exploration policies were clearly superior to a simple epsilon-greedy policy. Furthermore, the quantum agents did in fact sample flagged actions in less iterations. Despite obtaining tagged actions more consistently, the win rates between the classical and quantum versions of the approach were identical, which could be due to the simplicity of the training scenario chosen.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, to be submitted to a journal</p></details> |

Existing methods often falter when standardizing CDEs of varying representation and complex structure, impeding data integration and interoperability in clinical research. We introduce CDE-Mapper, an innovative framework that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach combined with Large Language Models to automate the linking of CDEs to controlled vocabularies. Our modular approach features query decomposition to manage varying levels of CDEs complexity, integrates expert-defined rules within prompt engineering, and employs in-context learning alongside multiple retriever components to resolve terminological ambiguities. In addition, we propose a knowledge reservoir validated by a human-in-loop approach, achieving accurate concept linking for future applications while minimizing computational costs. For four diverse datasets, CDE-Mapper achieved an average of 7.2\% higher accuracy improvement compared to baseline methods.

Five distinct deep-learning models were trained on a comprehensive dataset of cuneiform characters and evaluated according to critical performance metrics, including accuracy and precision. Two models demonstrated outstanding performance and were subsequently assessed using cuneiform symbols from the Hammurabi law acquisition, notably Hammurabi Law 1. Each model effectively recognized the relevant Akkadian meanings of the symbols and delivered precise English translations. Future work will investigate ensemble and stacking approaches to optimize performance, utilizing hybrid architectures to improve detection accuracy and reliability. This research explores the linguistic relationships between Akkadian, an ancient Mesopotamian language, and Arabic, emphasizing their historical and cultural linkages. This study demonstrates the capability of deep learning to decipher ancient scripts by merging computational linguistics with archaeology, therefore providing significant insights for the comprehension and conservation of human history.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Efficient Prediction of excited-state properties using Quantum Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09423v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the properties of excited states of complex molecules is crucial for many chemical and physical processes. Calculating these properties is often significantly more resource-intensive than calculating their ground state counterparts. We present a quantum machine learning model that predicts excited-state properties from the molecular ground state for different geometric configurations. The model comprises a symmetry-invariant quantum neural network and a conventional neural network and is able to provide accurate predictions with only a few training data points. The proposed procedure is fully NISQ compatible. This is achieved by using a quantum circuit that requires a number of parameters linearly proportional to the number of molecular orbitals, along with a parameterized measurement observable, thereby reducing the number of necessary measurements. We benchmark the algorithm on three different molecules with three different system sizes: $H_2$ with four orbitals, LiH with five orbitals, and $H_4$ with six orbitals. For these molecules, we predict the excited state transition energies and transition dipole moments. We show that, in many cases, the procedure is able to outperform various classical models (support vector machines, Gaussian processes, and neural networks) that rely solely on classical features, by up to two orders of magnitude in the test mean squared error.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 + ...</summary><p>11 + 6 pages, 7 + 5 figures</p></details> |

A critical challenge faced by sustainable precision agriculture is weed growth, as weeds compete for essential resources with crops, such as water, soil nutrients, and sunlight, which notably affect crop yields. The adoption of automated computer vision technologies and ground agricultural consumer electronic vehicles in precision agriculture offers sustainable, low-carbon solutions. However, prior works suffer from issues such as low accuracy and precision, as well as high computational expense. This work proposes EcoWeedNet, a novel model that enhances weed detection performance without introducing significant computational complexity, aligning with the goals of low-carbon agricultural practices. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the CottonWeedDet12 benchmark dataset, which reflects real-world scenarios. EcoWeedNet achieves performance comparable to that of large models (mAP@0.5 = 95.2%), yet with significantly fewer parameters (approximately 4.21% of the parameters of YOLOv4), lower computational complexity and better computational efficiency 6.59% of the GFLOPs of YOLOv4). These key findings indicate EcoWeedNet's deployability on low-power consumer hardware, lower energy consumption, and hence reduced carbon footprint, thereby emphasizing the application prospects of EcoWeedNet in next-generation sustainable agriculture. These findings provide the way forward for increased application of environmentally-friendly agricultural consumer technologies.</p></details> |  |

What follows is a brief description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise. The 13th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software (ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy, France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad (Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications, in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and stakeholders in education. While this volume goes to press, the next edition of the ThEdu workshop is being prepared: ThEdu'25 will be a satellite event of the 30th international Conference on Automated DEduction (CADE-30), July 28th - August 2nd, 2025, Stuttgart, Germany.</p></details> |  |

Concept drift detection is a field dedicated to identifying statistical shifts that is underutilized in monitoring neural networks that may encounter inference data with distributional characteristics diverging from their training data. Given the wide variety of model architectures, applications, and datasets, it is important that concept drift detection algorithms are adaptable to different inference scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an application of the $\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Hypothesis Test as a drift detection meta-algorithm applied to a multilayer perceptron, a convolutional neural network, and a transformer trained for machine vision as they are exposed to simulated drift during inference. To that end, we demonstrate how unexpected drops in accuracy due to concept drift can be detected without directly examining the inference outputs.

| **[Flow Models for Unbounded and Geometry-Aware Distributional Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04310v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new architecture for Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) that models return distributions using normalizing flows. This approach enables flexible, unbounded support for return distributions, in contrast to categorical approaches like C51 that rely on fixed or bounded representations. It also offers richer modeling capacity to capture multi-modality, skewness, and tail behavior than quantile based approaches. Our method is significantly more parameter-efficient than categorical approaches. Standard metrics used to train existing models like KL divergence or Wasserstein distance either are scale insensitive or have biased sample gradients, especially when return supports do not overlap. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate for the Cram\`er distance, that is geometry-aware and computable directly from the return distribution's PDF, avoiding the costly CDF computation. We test our model on the ATARI-5 sub-benchmark and show that our approach outperforms PDF based models while remaining competitive with quantile based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Location Search for Identifying Maximum Weighted Independent Sets in Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04674v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Artificial intelligence (AI), including Generative AI, are effective at generating high-quality traffic data and optimization solutions in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), these techniques often demand significant training time and computational resources, especially in large-scale and complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP) technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for 350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177 instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed, highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their increased complexity introduces novel safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment through evaluators like GPT-4o. We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally, misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (8 main), to be published in IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[GASCADE: Grouped Summarization of Adverse Drug Event for Enhanced Cancer Pharmacovigilance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04284v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of cancer treatment, summarizing adverse drug events (ADEs) reported by patients using prescribed drugs is crucial for enhancing pharmacovigilance practices and improving drug-related decision-making. While the volume and complexity of pharmacovigilance data have increased, existing research in this field has predominantly focused on general diseases rather than specifically addressing cancer. This work introduces the task of grouped summarization of adverse drug events reported by multiple patients using the same drug for cancer treatment. To address the challenge of limited resources in cancer pharmacovigilance, we present the MultiLabeled Cancer Adverse Drug Reaction and Summarization (MCADRS) dataset. This dataset includes pharmacovigilance posts detailing patient concerns regarding drug efficacy and adverse effects, along with extracted labels for drug names, adverse drug events, severity, and adversity of reactions, as well as summaries of ADEs for each drug. Additionally, we propose the Grouping and Abstractive Summarization of Cancer Adverse Drug events (GASCADE) framework, a novel pipeline that combines the information extraction capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the summarization power of the encoder-decoder T5 model. Our work is the first to apply alignment techniques, including advanced algorithms like Direct Preference Optimization, to encoder-decoder models using synthetic datasets for summarization tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of GASCADE across various metrics, validated through both automated assessments and human evaluations. This multitasking approach enhances drug-related decision-making and fosters a deeper understanding of patient concerns, paving the way for advancements in personalized and responsive cancer care. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards User-Centred Design of AI-Assisted Decision-Making in Law Enforcement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17393v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these systems. Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain.</p></details> | 10 pages |

It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Conversational Process Model Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05453v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign. However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiMind: Enhancing Werewolf Agents with Multimodal Reasoning and Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18039v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[EcoAgent: An Efficient Edge-Cloud Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Mobile Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05440v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiTransProQA: an LLM-based Literary Translation evaluation metric with Professional Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05423v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LiTransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. LiTransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LiTransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, LiTransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.</p></details> | Update WIP |

We introduce AskGNN, a novel approach that bridges this gap by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate graph data and task-specific information into LLMs. AskGNN employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered structure-enhanced retriever to select labeled nodes across graphs, incorporating complex graph structures and their supervision signals. Our learning-to-retrieve algorithm optimizes the retriever to select example nodes that maximize LLM performance on graph. Experiments across three tasks and seven LLMs demonstrate AskGNN's superior effectiveness in graph task performance, opening new avenues for applying LLMs to graph-structured data without extensive fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Differential Testing With LLMs For Testing Deep Learning Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07944v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by ACM TOSEM.

Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50\% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR2025 (32 pages, 6 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Jailbreaking and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15236v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by advancing natural language understanding and generation, enabling applications across fields beyond healthcare, software engineering, and conversational systems. Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latte: Transfering LLMs` Latent-level Knowledge for Few-shot Tabular Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05237v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot tabular learning, in which machine learning models are trained with a limited amount of labeled data, provides a cost-effective approach to addressing real-world challenges. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain</p></details> |  |
| **[Stealthy LLM-Driven Data Poisoning Attacks Against Embedding-Based Retrieval-Augmented Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05196v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a systematic study of provider-side data poisoning in retrieval-augmented recommender systems (RAG-based). By modifying only a small fraction of tokens within item descriptions -- for instance, adding emotional keywords or borrowing phrases from semantically related items -- an attacker can significantly promote or demote targeted items. We formalize these attacks under token-edit and semantic-similarity constraints, and we examine their effectiveness in both promotion (long-tail items) and demotion (short-head items) scenarios. Our experiments on MovieLens, using two large language model (LLM) retrieval modules, show that even subtle attacks shift final rankings and item exposures while eluding naive detection. The results underscore the vulnerability of RAG-based pipelines to small-scale metadata rewrites and emphasize the need for robust textual consistency checks and provenance tracking to thwart stealthy provider-side poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing Weaknesses in Text Watermarking Through Self-Information Rewrite Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05190v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Accpeted |

However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively.

| **[MARK: Memory Augmented Refinement of Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05177v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in specialized tasks but struggle to align with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid') and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory: Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role: Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension; LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory, detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy. Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference; Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets; Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Re-evaluating Open-ended Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20170v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation has traditionally focused on ranking candidates for a specific skill. Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This study evaluates the classification performance of five open-source LLMs: GEMMA-3-27B-IT, LLAMA3-70B, LLAMA4-109B, DEEPSEEK-R1-DISTILL-LLAMA-70B, and DEEPSEEK-V3-0324-UD-Q2_K_XL, across six healthcare-related classification tasks involving both social media data (breast cancer, changes in medication regimen, adverse pregnancy outcomes, potential COVID-19 cases) and clinical data (stigma labeling, medication change discussion). We report precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals for all model-task combinations. Our findings reveal significant performance variability between LLMs, with DeepSeekV3 emerging as the strongest overall performer, achieving the highest F1 scores in four tasks. Notably, models generally performed better on social media tasks compared to clinical data tasks, suggesting potential domain-specific challenges. GEMMA-3-27B-IT demonstrated exceptionally high recall despite its smaller parameter count, while LLAMA4-109B showed surprisingly underwhelming performance compared to its predecessor LLAMA3-70B, indicating that larger parameter counts do not guarantee improved classification results. We observed distinct precision-recall trade-offs across models, with some favoring sensitivity over specificity and vice versa. These findings highlight the importance of task-specific model selection for healthcare applications, considering the particular data domain and precision-recall requirements rather than model size alone. As healthcare increasingly integrates AI-driven text classification tools, this comprehensive benchmarking provides valuable guidance for model selection and implementation while underscoring the need for continued evaluation and domain adaptation of LLMs in healthcare contexts.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP) can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy, (ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii) propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on 6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster, Cheaper, Better: Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for LLM and RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18635v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) enable natural language interactions with databases through models like Text2SQL and Text2Cypher. Fine-tuning these models typically requires large, diverse datasets containing non-trivial examples. However, as dataset size increases, the cost of fine-tuning also rises. This makes smaller, high-quality datasets essential for reducing costs for the same or better performance. In this paper, we propose five hard-example selection techniques for pruning the Text2Cypher dataset, aiming to preserve or improve performance while reducing resource usage. Our results show that these hard-example selection approaches can halve training time and costs with minimal impact on performance, and demonstrates that hard-example selection provides a cost-effective solution.</p></details> |  |

The scarcity of labeled ECG data coupled with the diverse nature of clinical inquiries presents a significant challenge for developing robust and adaptable ECG diagnostic systems. This work introduces a novel multimodal meta-learning method for few-shot ECG question answering, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data while leveraging the rich knowledge encoded within large language models (LLMs). Our LLM-agnostic approach integrates a pre-trained ECG encoder with a frozen LLM (e.g., LLaMA and Gemma) via a trainable fusion module, enabling the language model to reason about ECG data and generate clinically meaningful answers. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior generalization to unseen diagnostic tasks compared to supervised baselines, achieving notable performance even with limited ECG leads. For instance, in a 5-way 5-shot setting, our method using LLaMA-3.1-8B achieves an accuracy of 84.6%, 77.3%, and 69.6% on single verify, choose and query question types, respectively. These results highlight the potential of our method to enhance clinical ECG interpretation by combining signal processing with the nuanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs, particularly in data-constrained scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AHLI CHIL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-agent Embodied AI: Advances and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05108v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Outpatient Referral: Problem Definition, Benchmarking and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08292v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to outpatient referral tasks across healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Type-Constrained Code Generation with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09246v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code generation. However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because their next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code. Although constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue, it has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or syntactic features of general-purpose programming languages. However, LLMs frequently generate code with typing errors, which are beyond the domain of syntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge, we introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems to guide code generation. For this purpose, we develop novel prefix automata and a search over inhabitable types, forming a sound approach to enforce well-typedness on LLM-generated code. We formalize our approach on a foundational simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate practicality. Our evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP datasets shows that our approach reduces compilation errors by more than half and significantly increases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair tasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including state-of-the-art open-weight models with more than 30B parameters. The results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach in constraining LLM code generation with formal rules of type systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite their versatility, existing open-source unified models exhibit performance gaps against domain-specific architectures. To bridge this gap, we present Nexus-Gen, a unified model that synergizes the language reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the image synthesis power of diffusion models. To align the embedding space of the LLM and diffusion model, we conduct a dual-phase alignment training process. (1) The autoregressive LLM learns to predict image embeddings conditioned on multimodal inputs, while (2) the vision decoder is trained to reconstruct high-fidelity images from these embeddings. During training the LLM, we identified a critical discrepancy between the autoregressive paradigm's training and inference phases, where error accumulation in continuous embedding space severely degrades generation quality. To avoid this issue, we introduce a prefilled autoregression strategy that prefills input sequence with position-embedded special tokens instead of continuous embeddings. Through dual-phase training, Nexus-Gen has developed the integrated capability to comprehensively address the image understanding, generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and codes are published at https://github.com/modelscope/Nexus-Gen.git to facilitate further advancements across the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaterDrum: Watermarking for Data-centric Unlearning Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05064v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) unlearning is critical in real-world applications where it is necessary to efficiently remove the influence of private, copyrighted, or harmful data from some users. However, existing utility-centric unlearning metrics (based on model utility) may fail to accurately evaluate the extent of unlearning in realistic settings such as when (a) the forget and retain set have semantically similar content, (b) retraining the model from scratch on the retain set is impractical, and/or (c) the model owner can improve the unlearning metric without directly performing unlearning on the LLM. This paper presents the first data-centric unlearning metric for LLMs called WaterDrum that exploits robust text watermarking for overcoming these limitations. We also introduce new benchmark datasets for LLM unlearning that contain varying levels of similar data points and can be used to rigorously evaluate unlearning algorithms using WaterDrum. Our code is available at https://github.com/lululu008/WaterDrum and our new benchmark datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Glow-AI/WaterDrum-Ax.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish (Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most prior work has been limited to perplexity or basic knowledge tasks and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of recent models like Llama-3.3. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models spanning 1B to 405B parameters, applying four quantization methods across 13 datasets. Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in coding and STEM tasks, though reasoning may sometimes improve.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IJCAI 2025, 21 pages, 2 figure</p></details> |
| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

Multi-LLM Repeated Sampling Efficiently Scales Test-Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00762v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the scalable problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs while underutilizing the advantage of on-device SLMs in accessing and processing personalized data. This leads to two interconnected issues: 1) Limited utilization of the problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs, which fail to align with personalized user-task needs, and 2) Inadequate integration of user data into on-device SLM responses, resulting in mismatches in contextual user information. In this paper, we propose a Leader-Subordinate Retrieval framework for Privacy-preserving cloud-device collaboration (LSRP), a novel solution that bridges these gaps by: 1) enhancing on-cloud LLM guidance to on-device SLM through a dynamic selection of task-specific leader strategies named as user-to-user retrieval-augmented generation (U-U-RAG), and 2) integrating the data advantages of on-device SLMs through small model feedback Direct Preference Optimization (SMFB-DPO) for aligning the on-cloud LLM with the on-device SLM. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that LSRP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving question-answer relevance and personalization, while preserving user privacy through efficient on-device retrieval.

Previously, Group Recommender Systems (GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in: Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP Adjunct '25), June 16--19, 2025, New York City, NY, USA Accepted at the 4th Workshop on Group Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (GMAP), co-located at UMAP 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Driven Usefulness Judgment for Web Search Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14401v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation is fundamental in optimizing search experiences and supporting diverse user intents in Information Retrieval (IR). Traditional search evaluation methods primarily rely on relevance labels, which assess how well retrieved documents match a user's query. However, relevance alone fails to capture a search system's effectiveness in helping users achieve their search goals, making usefulness a critical evaluation criterion. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach: LLM-generated usefulness labels, which incorporate both implicit and explicit user behavior signals to evaluate document usefulness. We propose Task-aware Rubric-based Usefulness Evaluation (TRUE), a rubric-driven evaluation method that employs iterative sampling and reasoning to model complex search behavior patterns. Our findings show that (i) LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by leveraging comprehensive search session history incorporating personalization and contextual understanding, and (ii) fine-tuned LLMs improve usefulness judgments when provided with structured search session contexts. Additionally, we examine whether LLMs can distinguish between relevance and usefulness, particularly in cases where this divergence impacts search success. We also conduct an ablation study to identify key metrics for accurate usefulness label generation, optimizing for token efficiency and cost-effectiveness in real-world applications. This study advances LLM-based usefulness evaluation by refining key user metrics, exploring LLM-generated label reliability, and ensuring feasibility for large-scale search systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments: When Should We Ask LLMs for Help?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06877v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test collections are information retrieval tools that allow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate ranking algorithms. While test collections have become an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves significant effort in manual annotations, which often makes it very expensive and time-consuming. Thus, test collections could become too small when the budget is limited, which may lead to unstable evaluations. As a cheaper alternative, recent studies have proposed the use of large language models (LLMs) to completely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs seem to somewhat correlate with human judgments, their predictions are not perfect and often show bias. Thus a complete replacement with LLMs is argued to be too risky and not fully reliable. Thus, in this paper, we propose LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments (LARA), an effective method to balance manual annotations with LLM annotations, which helps to build a rich and reliable test collection even under a low budget. We use the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities to select the most profitable documents to manually annotate under a budget constraint. With theoretical reasoning, LARA effectively guides the human annotation process by actively learning to calibrate the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities. Then, using the calibration model learned from the limited manual annotations, LARA debiases the LLM predictions to annotate the remaining non-assessed data. Empirical evaluations on TREC-7 Ad Hoc, TREC-8 Ad Hoc, TREC Robust 2004, and TREC-COVID datasets show that LARA outperforms alternative solutions under almost any budget constraint.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

Nevertheless, our empirical and theoretical findings unequivocally demonstrate a pronounced optimization gradient bias in favor of acquiring representations from multimodal features over item ID embeddings. As a consequence, item ID embeddings frequently exhibit suboptimal characteristics despite the convergence of multimodal feature parameters. Given the rich informational content inherent in multimodal features, in this paper, we propose a novel model (i.e., LIRDRec) that learns item representations directly from these features to augment recommendation performance. Recognizing that features derived from each modality may capture disparate yet correlated aspects of items, we propose a multimodal transformation mechanism, integrated with modality-specific encoders, to effectively fuse features from all modalities. Moreover, to differentiate the influence of diverse modality types, we devise a progressive weight copying fusion module within LIRDRec. This module incrementally learns the weight assigned to each modality in synthesizing the final user or item representations. Finally, we utilize the powerful visual understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to convert the item images into texts and extract semantics embeddings upon the texts via LLMs. Empirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach relative to competing baselines. It is worth noting the proposed model, equipped with embeddings extracted from MLLMs and LLMs, can further improve the recommendation accuracy of NDCG@20 by an average of 4.21% compared to the original embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/enoche/LIRDRec</p></details> |

However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens.

These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Based LLMs for Position Bias-Aware Reranking in Personalized Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04948v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across digital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.</p></details> |  |

However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Risk Propensities of Large Language Models: Ethical Focus and Bias Detection through Role-Play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08884v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more prevalent, concerns about their safety, ethics, and potential biases have risen. Systematically evaluating LLMs' risk decision-making tendencies and attitudes, particularly in the ethical domain, has become crucial. This study innovatively applies the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale from cognitive science to LLMs and proposes a novel Ethical Decision-Making Risk Attitude Scale (EDRAS) to assess LLMs' ethical risk attitudes in depth. We further propose a novel approach integrating risk scales and role-playing to quantitatively evaluate systematic biases in LLMs. Through systematic evaluation and analysis of multiple mainstream LLMs, we assessed the "risk personalities" of LLMs across multiple domains, with a particular focus on the ethical domain, and revealed and quantified LLMs' systematic biases towards different groups. This research helps understand LLMs' risk decision-making and ensure their safe and reliable application. Our approach provides a tool for identifying and mitigating biases, contributing to fairer and more trustworthy AI systems. The code and data are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CogSci 2025</p></details> |

The dataset encodes 37,710 pairwise comparisons across 13,462 images, structured along six criteria - Accessibility, Safety, Comfort, Invitingness, Inclusivity, and Diversity - derived from 634 community-defined concepts. Using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL to reflect multi-criteria spatial preferences and evaluate the LIVS dataset and the fine-tuned model through four case studies: (1) DPO increases alignment with annotated preferences, particularly when annotation volume is high; (2) preference patterns vary across participant identities, underscoring the need for intersectional data; (3) human-authored prompts generate more distinctive visual outputs than LLM-generated ones, influencing annotation decisiveness; and (4) intersectional groups assign systematically different ratings across criteria, revealing the limitations of single-objective alignment. While DPO improves alignment under specific conditions, the prevalence of neutral ratings indicates that community values are heterogeneous and often ambiguous. LIVS provides a benchmark for developing T2I models that incorporate local, stakeholder-driven preferences, offering a foundation for context-aware alignment in spatial design.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[An Open-Source Dual-Loss Embedding Model for Semantic Retrieval in Higher Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04916v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational tools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique linguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series. This work contributes reusable, domain-aligned embedding models and provides a replicable framework for educational semantic retrieval, supporting downstream applications such as academic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and learning management system (LMS) integrations.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 Tables |

To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether, and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2 outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research, and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |
| **[ValuesRAG: Enhancing Cultural Alignment Through Retrieval-Augmented Contextual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01031v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, as these models often embed Western-centric biases from their training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness concerns in cross-cultural applications. Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems. Our findings underscore the potential of dynamic retrieval-based methods to bridge the gap between global LLM capabilities and localized cultural values.</p></details> | preprint |

To fully exploit this methodology at scale, we introduce Persona Hub -- a collection of 1 billion diverse personas automatically curated from web data. These 1 billion personas (~13% of the world's total population), acting as distributed carriers of world knowledge, can tap into almost every perspective encapsulated within the LLM, thereby facilitating the creation of diverse synthetic data at scale for various scenarios. By showcasing Persona Hub's use cases in synthesizing high-quality mathematical and logical reasoning problems, instructions (i.e., user prompts), knowledge-rich texts, game NPCs and tools (functions) at scale, we demonstrate persona-driven data synthesis is versatile, scalable, flexible, and easy to use, potentially driving a paradigm shift in synthetic data creation and applications in practice, which may have a profound impact on LLM research and development.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[PR2: Peephole Raw Pointer Rewriting with LLMs for Translating C to Safer Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04852v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLM Faithfulness in RAG with Evolving Leaderboards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04847v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a way to assist scientists by improving the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing this influx of information. However, scaling RAG to handle millions of articles introduces significant challenges, including the high computational costs associated with parsing documents and embedding scientific knowledge, as well as the algorithmic complexity of aligning these representations with the nuanced semantics of scientific content. To address these issues, we introduce HiPerRAG, a RAG workflow powered by high performance computing (HPC) to index and retrieve knowledge from more than 3.6 million scientific articles. At its core are Oreo, a high-throughput model for multimodal document parsing, and ColTrast, a query-aware encoder fine-tuning algorithm that enhances retrieval accuracy by using contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques. HiPerRAG delivers robust performance on existing scientific question answering benchmarks and two new benchmarks introduced in this work, achieving 90% accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA-outperforming both domain-specific models like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4. Scaling to thousands of GPUs on the Polaris, Sunspot, and Frontier supercomputers, HiPerRAG delivers million document-scale RAG workflows for unifying scientific knowledge and fostering interdisciplinary innovation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference (PASC 25), June 16-18, 2025, Brugg-Windisch, Switzerland</p></details> |

Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE 4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE CAI Workshop on Adaptive Cyber Defense 2025.

| **[Putting the Value Back in RL: Better Test-Time Scaling by Unifying LLM Reasoners With Verifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04842v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for fine-tuning LLM reasoners, such as GRPO or Leave-one-out PPO, abandon the learned value function in favor of empirically estimated returns. This hinders test-time compute scaling that relies on using the value-function for verification. In this work, we propose RL$^V$ that augments any ``value-free'' RL method by jointly training the LLM as both a reasoner and a generative verifier using RL-generated data, adding verification capabilities without significant overhead. Empirically, RL$^V$ boosts MATH accuracy by over 20\% with parallel sampling and enables $8-32\times$ efficient test-time compute scaling compared to the base RL method. RL$^V$ also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for both easy-to-hard and out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, RL$^V$ achieves $1.2-1.6\times$ higher performance when jointly scaling parallel and sequential test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces "XG-NID," a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to fuse flow-level and packet-level data within a heterogeneous graph structure, offering a comprehensive analysis of network traffic. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed "GNN4ID," an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data. Our comprehensive quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that XG-NID achieves an F1 score of 97\% in multi-class classification, outperforming existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This sets a new standard in Network Intrusion Detection Systems by combining innovative data fusion with enhanced interpretability and real-time capabilities.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

However, these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak, an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational systems.</p></details> | 21 pages |

In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality" from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity. First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model, it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention (ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into account, bad data may lead to good models.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with 84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.</p></details> |  |

This can be crucial for tasks such as patent matching, legal or compliance case retrieval, and academic literature review. Existing retrieval methods, including keyword search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen. We provide a comparative analysis of our proposed methods in terms of cost, speed, and the human interface with the domain experts. The methods we compare leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) which can incorporate domain expert input to produce document scores and rankings, as well as explanations for human review. The process and methods for it that we present can significantly reduce human effort in dataset creation for custom domains while still obtaining sufficient expert knowledge for tuning retrieval models. We evaluate our methods on QBD datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and finetune the parameters of the BM25 model -- which is used in many industrial-strength search engines like OpenSearch -- using the generated data.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, these models predominantly focus on English, leaving multilingual embedding capabilities largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we present LUSIFER, a novel zero-shot approach that adapts LLM-based embedding models for multilingual tasks without requiring multilingual supervision. LUSIFER's architecture combines a multilingual encoder, serving as a language-universal learner, with an LLM-based embedding model optimized for embedding-specific tasks. These components are seamlessly integrated through a minimal set of trainable parameters that act as a connector, effectively transferring the multilingual encoder's language understanding capabilities to the specialized embedding model. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate multilingual embedding performance, we introduce a new benchmark encompassing 5 primary embedding tasks, 123 diverse datasets, and coverage across 14 languages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LUSIFER significantly enhances the multilingual performance across various embedding tasks, particularly for medium and low-resource languages, without requiring explicit multilingual training data.</p></details> |  |

Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |

With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs. However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations. First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages. Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues. Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues. In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain. OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues. Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images. The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information. Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ISSTA'25</p></details> |

These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution. In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures; clarify relation to indirect prompt injection attacks</p></details> |

To this end, it describes: (1) an internally developed proof of concept pipeline that employs state-of-the-art practices to deliver safe and trustable analysis for healthcare documents and scientific papers called RAGEv (Retrieval Augmented Generation Evaluation); (2) a set of evaluation tools for LLM-based document retrieval and generation; (3) a benchmark dataset to verify the accuracy and veracity of the results called RAGEv-Bench. It concludes that careful implementations of RAG techniques could minimize most of the common problems in the use of LLMs for document processing in the health domain, obtaining very high scores both on short yes/no answers and long answers. There is a high potential for incorporating it into the day-to-day work of policy support tasks, but additional efforts are required to obtain a consistent and trustworthy tool.</p></details> |  |

These models assist programmers in generating code, potentially increasing productivity and efficiency. However, the environmental impact of utilising these AI models is substantial, given their high energy consumption during both training and inference stages. This research aims to compare the energy consumption of manual software development versus an LLM-assisted approach, using Codeforces as a simulation platform for software development. The goal is to quantify the environmental impact and propose strategies for minimising the carbon footprint of using LLM in software development. Our results show that the LLM-assisted code generation leads on average to 32.72 higher carbon footprint than the manual one. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between task complexity and the difference in the carbon footprint of the two approaches.</p></details> |  |

These OM-specific hallucinations are carefully classified into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset in constructing the LLM leaderboard and fine-tuning foundational LLMs for LLM-based OM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 2 prompt templates</p></details> |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features. To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating. First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise. Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions. Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.

However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose OBLIVIATE, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA), it ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including the Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: forget quality (new document-level memorization score), model utility, and fluency. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | 18 pages, 2 figures |

Typically, the performance of LLMs is measured on benchmarks with small or medium-sized context windows of thousands of lines of code. At the same time, in real-world software projects, repositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by contributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The benchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large repositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of functions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies, docstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper presents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at function body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not covered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large repositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC. Third, we contribute a scalable evaluation pipeline for efficient computing of the target metrics and a tool for visual analysis of generated code. Overall, these three aspects allow for evaluating code generation in large repositories in C and C++.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at LLM4Code 2025 Workshop co-located wtih ICSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Estimating LLM Uncertainty with Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00290v5)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.</p></details> |  |

Evaluation includes close-ended, open-ended, safety and human assessments, to maximize the reliability of results. Results: Recommendations are made across the entire pipeline, backed by the solid performance of the Aloe Family. These models deliver competitive performance across healthcare benchmarks and medical fields, and are often preferred by healthcare professionals. On bias and toxicity, the Aloe Beta models significantly improve safety, showing resilience to unseen jailbreaking attacks. For a responsible release, a detailed risk assessment specific to healthcare is attached to the Aloe Family models. Conclusion: The Aloe Beta models, and the recipe that leads to them, are a significant contribution to the open-source medical LLM field, offering top-of-the-line performance while maintaining high ethical requirements.

However, their computational costs make them infeasible for processing large document corpora. To address this, retrieval systems often employ a telescoping approach, where computationally efficient but less precise lexical and semantic retrievers filter potential candidates for further ranking. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of early-stage retrieval, which can potentially exclude relevant documents early in the process. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for re-ranking called online relevance estimation that continuously updates relevance estimates for a query throughout the ranking process. Instead of re-ranking a fixed set of top-k documents in a single step, online relevance estimation iteratively re-scores smaller subsets of the most promising documents while adjusting relevance scores for the remaining pool based on the estimations from the final model using an online bandit-based algorithm. This dynamic process mitigates the recall limitations of telescoping systems by re-prioritizing documents initially deemed less relevant by earlier stages -- including those completely excluded by earlier-stage retrievers. We validate our approach on TREC benchmarks under two scenarios: hybrid retrieval and adaptive retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is sample-efficient and significantly improves recall, highlighting the effectiveness of our online relevance estimation framework for modern search systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at SIGIR'25 . 11 pages,5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[LLM-based Bi-level Multi-interest Learning Framework for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09410v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) leverages users' dynamic preferences, with recent advances incorporating multi-interest learning to model diverse user interests. However, most multi-interest SR models rely on noisy, sparse implicit feedback, limiting recommendation accuracy. Large language models (LLMs) offer robust reasoning on low-quality data but face high computational costs and latency challenges for SR integration. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-interest SR framework combining implicit behavioral and explicit semantic perspectives. It includes two modules: the Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM), which learns from user behavior using a traditional SR model, and the Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM), which uses clustering and prompt-engineered LLMs to extract semantic multi-interest representations from informative samples. Semantic insights from ESIM enhance IBIM's behavioral representations via modality alignment and semantic prediction tasks. During inference, only IBIM is used, ensuring efficient, LLM-free recommendations. Experiments on four real-world datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

However, their increased complexity introduces novel safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment through evaluators like GPT-4o. We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally, misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (8 main), to be published in IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

While the volume and complexity of pharmacovigilance data have increased, existing research in this field has predominantly focused on general diseases rather than specifically addressing cancer. This work introduces the task of grouped summarization of adverse drug events reported by multiple patients using the same drug for cancer treatment. To address the challenge of limited resources in cancer pharmacovigilance, we present the MultiLabeled Cancer Adverse Drug Reaction and Summarization (MCADRS) dataset. This dataset includes pharmacovigilance posts detailing patient concerns regarding drug efficacy and adverse effects, along with extracted labels for drug names, adverse drug events, severity, and adversity of reactions, as well as summaries of ADEs for each drug. Additionally, we propose the Grouping and Abstractive Summarization of Cancer Adverse Drug events (GASCADE) framework, a novel pipeline that combines the information extraction capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the summarization power of the encoder-decoder T5 model. Our work is the first to apply alignment techniques, including advanced algorithms like Direct Preference Optimization, to encoder-decoder models using synthetic datasets for summarization tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of GASCADE across various metrics, validated through both automated assessments and human evaluations. This multitasking approach enhances drug-related decision-making and fosters a deeper understanding of patient concerns, paving the way for advancements in personalized and responsive cancer care. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages plus 2 pages of supplemental material</p></details> |

Despite their impressive adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic variations. Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a highly promising tool for defensive and offensive cybersecurity-related strategies. While existing literature has focused much on the defensive use of LLMs, when it comes to their offensive utilization, very little has been reported-namely, concerning Vulnerability Assessment (VA) report validation. Consequentially, this paper tries to fill that gap by investigating the capabilities of LLMs in automating and improving the validation process of the report of the VA. From the critical review of the related literature, this paper hereby proposes a new approach to using the LLMs in the automation of the analysis and within the validation process of the report of the VA that could potentially reduce the number of false positives and generally enhance efficiency. These results are promising for LLM automatization for improving validation on reports coming from VA in order to improve accuracy while reducing human effort and security postures. The contribution of this paper provides further evidence about the offensive and defensive LLM capabilities and therefor helps in devising more appropriate cybersecurity strategies and tools accordingly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print - Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the International Computer Sciences and Informatics Conference (ICSIC-2024), published by AIP Publishing</p></details> |

However, untrained lay users have poor prompt specification abilities and often struggle with conveying their latent preferences to AI assistants. To address this, we leverage activation steering to guide LLMs to align with interpretable preference dimensions during inference. In contrast to memory-based personalization methods that require longer user history, steering is extremely lightweight and can be easily controlled by the user via an linear strength factor. We embed steering into three different interactive chatbot interfaces and conduct a within-subjects user study (n=14) to investigate how end users prefer to personalize their conversations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of preference-based steering for aligning real-world conversations with hidden user preferences, and highlight further insights on how diverse values around control, usability, and transparency lead users to prefer different interfaces.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of compilation instruction search and error resolution makes automatic compilation challenging. Inspired by the success of LLM-based agents in various fields, we propose CompileAgent, the first LLM-based agent framework dedicated to repo-level compilation. CompileAgent integrates five tools and a flow-based agent strategy, enabling interaction with software artifacts for compilation instruction search and error resolution. To measure the effectiveness of our method, we design a public repo-level benchmark CompileAgentBench, and we also design two baselines for comparison by combining two compilation-friendly schemes. The performance on this benchmark shows that our method significantly improves the compilation success rate, ranging from 10% to 71%. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of CompileAgent under different agent strategies and verify the effectiveness of the flow-based strategy. Additionally, we emphasize the scalability of CompileAgent, further expanding its application prospects.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

This holds true within the field of software engineering (SE) as well. The state-of-the-art research on MAS within SE focuses on integrating LLMs at the core of autonomous agents to create LLM-based multi-agent autonomous (LMA) systems. However, the introduction of LMA systems into SE brings a plethora of challenges. One of the major challenges is the strategic allocation of tasks between humans and the LMA system in a trustworthy manner. To address this challenge, a RACI-based framework is proposed in this work in progress article, along with implementation guidelines and an example implementation of the framework. The proposed framework can facilitate efficient collaboration, ensure accountability, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM-driven automation while aligning with the Trustworthy AI guidelines.

To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation.To address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process effectively. Our approach follows a "cold start, then PRM supervision" paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions (Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline. Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that combining PRM as an online training signal (GRPO) with PRM-guided inference (e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by a 7B PRM to achieve a 13.1% performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.</p></details> |  |

The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs). We propose InfiniteHBD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfiniteHBD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfiniteHBD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</p></details> |  |
| **[Fate: Fast Edge Inference of Mixture-of-Experts Models via Cross-Layer Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12224v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and their application in edge scenarios has attracted significant attention. However, sparse-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which are well suited for edge scenarios, have received relatively little attention due to their high memory demands. Offload-based methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert prediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference delays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose Fate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is that gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert prefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU overhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy that increases the expert hit rate to 99\%. Additionally, Fate integrates tailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency. Experimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert Activation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in prefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively, while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements are scalable across different memory budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Large Language Model for Feasible and Diverse Population Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04196v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating a synthetic population that is both feasible and diverse is crucial for ensuring the validity of downstream activity schedule simulation in activity-based models (ABMs). While deep generative models (DGMs), such as variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, have been applied to this task, they often struggle to balance the inclusion of rare but plausible combinations (i.e., sampling zeros) with the exclusion of implausible ones (i.e., structural zeros). To improve feasibility while maintaining diversity, we propose a fine-tuning method for large language models (LLMs) that explicitly controls the autoregressive generation process through topological orderings derived from a Bayesian Network (BN). Experimental results show that our hybrid LLM-BN approach outperforms both traditional DGMs and proprietary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-4o) with few-shot learning. Specifically, our approach achieves approximately 95% feasibility, significantly higher than the ~80% observed in DGMs, while maintaining comparable diversity, making it well-suited for practical applications. Importantly, the method is based on a lightweight open-source LLM, enabling fine-tuning and inference on standard personal computing environments. This makes the approach cost-effective and scalable for large-scale applications, such as synthesizing populations in megacities, without relying on expensive infrastructure. By initiating the ABM pipeline with high-quality synthetic populations, our method improves overall simulation reliability and reduces downstream error propagation. The source code for these methods is available for research and practical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables.

Despite their demonstrated efficiency and performance, pretraining such non-standard architectures from scratch remains costly and risky. The linearization of large language models (LLMs) transforms pretrained standard models into linear recurrent structures, enabling more efficient deployment. However, current linearization methods typically introduce additional feature map modules that require extensive fine-tuning and overlook the gating mechanisms used in state-of-the-art linear recurrent models. To address these issues, this paper presents Liger, short for Linearizing LLMs to gated recurrent structures. Liger is a novel approach for converting pretrained LLMs into gated linear recurrent models without adding extra parameters. It repurposes the pretrained key matrix weights to construct diverse gating mechanisms, facilitating the formation of various gated recurrent structures while avoiding the need to train additional components from scratch. Using lightweight fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Liger restores the performance of the linearized gated recurrent models to match that of the original LLMs. Additionally, we introduce Liger Attention, an intra-layer hybrid attention mechanism, which significantly recovers 93\% of the Transformer-based LLM at 0.02\% pre-training tokens during the linearization process, achieving competitive results across multiple benchmarks, as validated on models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters.

Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComPO: Preference Alignment via Comparison Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05465v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.</p></details> | 25 pages |

In order to solve this vector-valued optimisation problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarisation functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarised problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimisation techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimisation problem into a single-objective optimisation problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem are the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarised optimisation problems. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimisation algorithms. We then analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimisation, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Review 2025. 47 pages.

| **[Conversational Process Model Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05453v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign. However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL-DAUNCE: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Data Assimilation with Uncertainty-Aware Constrained Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05452v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has become a powerful tool for enhancing data assimilation. While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning (RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework, which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second, RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space. Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially less computational effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiMind: Enhancing Werewolf Agents with Multimodal Reasoning and Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18039v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p></details> |  |

While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.</p></details> |  |

Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |

Although there are de facto consensuses on how to share research code (through a git repository linked to from publications) and trained models (via HuggingFace Hub), there is no consensus for other types of artifacts, such as built indexes. Given the practical utility of using shared indexes, researchers have resorted to self-hosting these resources or performing ad hoc file transfers upon request, ultimately limiting the artifacts' discoverability and reuse. This demonstration introduces a flexible and interoperable way to share artifacts for Information Retrieval research, improving both their accessibility and usability.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 (demo) |

However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 boxes, updated to published version</p></details> |

However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LiTransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. LiTransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LiTransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, LiTransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.</p></details> | Update WIP |

In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks.

However, continuous human monitoring and intervention can be highly labor-intensive and impractical when deploying a large number of robots. To address this limitation, we propose a method that allows diffusion policies to actively seek human assistance only when necessary, reducing reliance on constant human oversight. To achieve this, we leverage the generative process of diffusion policies to compute an uncertainty-based metric based on which the autonomous agent can decide to request operator assistance at deployment time, without requiring any operator interaction during training. Additionally, we show that the same method can be used for efficient data collection for fine-tuning diffusion policies in order to improve their autonomous performance. Experimental results from simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our approach enhances policy performance during deployment for a variety of scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 30 figures.

In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, current HDC-based applications often rely on high-precision models and/or encoding matrices to achieve competitive performance, which imposes significant computational and memory demands, especially for ultra-low power devices. While recent efforts use techniques like precision reduction and pruning to increase the efficiency, most require retraining to maintain performance, making them expensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose a novel Post Training Compression algorithm, Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization (DPQ-HD), which aims at compressing the end-to-end HDC system, achieving near floating point performance without the need of retraining. DPQ-HD reduces computational and memory overhead by uniquely combining the above three compression techniques and efficiently adapts to hardware constraints. Additionally, we introduce an energy-efficient inference approach that progressively evaluates similarity scores such as cosine similarity and performs early exit to reduce the computation, accelerating prediction inference while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate that DPQ-HD achieves up to 20-100x reduction in memory for image and graph classification tasks with only a 1-2% drop in accuracy compared to uncompressed workloads. Lastly, we show that DPQ-HD outperforms the existing post-training compression methods and performs better or at par with retraining-based state-of-the-art techniques, requiring significantly less overall optimization time (up to 100x) and faster inference (up to 56x) on a microcontroller</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05410v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crosslingual Reasoning through Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05408v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representing spherical tensors with scalar-based machine-learning models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05404v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors. The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to implement, and accurate in practical settings.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> |

We introduce AskGNN, a novel approach that bridges this gap by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate graph data and task-specific information into LLMs. AskGNN employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered structure-enhanced retriever to select labeled nodes across graphs, incorporating complex graph structures and their supervision signals. Our learning-to-retrieve algorithm optimizes the retriever to select example nodes that maximize LLM performance on graph. Experiments across three tasks and seven LLMs demonstrate AskGNN's superior effectiveness in graph task performance, opening new avenues for applying LLMs to graph-structured data without extensive fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

These methods face two challenges: (1) the retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed independently for each event without considering their possible relationship. In this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet effective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we propose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively leverage possible connections between different events and thus capture relevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further analysis shows the impact of different components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper in COLING 2025</p></details> |

| **[On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10729v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference.

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Coastal Inundation Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05381v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coastal flooding poses significant risks to communities, necessitating fast and accurate forecasting methods to mitigate potential damage. To approach this problem, we present DIFF-FLOOD, a probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting method designed based on denoising diffusion models. DIFF-FLOOD predicts inundation level at a location by taking both spatial and temporal context into account. It utilizes inundation levels at neighboring locations and digital elevation data as spatial context. Inundation history from a context time window, together with additional co-variates are used as temporal context. Convolutional neural networks and cross-attention mechanism are then employed to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested DIFF-FLOOD on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a region highly impacted by coastal flooding. Our results show that, DIFF-FLOOD outperforms existing forecasting methods in terms of prediction performance (6% to 64% improvement in terms of two performance metrics) and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Threshold Modulation for Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05375v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025. \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages) and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update 08.05.2025: Added some intermediate steps in the derivation of the loss to add clarity.

Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to \SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of \SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming, potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences</p></details> |

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards the Worst-case Robustness of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19040v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial attacks, where adversaries craft specific input sequences to induce harmful, violent, private, or incorrect outputs. In this work, we study their worst-case robustness, i.e., whether an adversarial example exists that leads to such undesirable outputs. We upper bound the worst-case robustness using stronger white-box attacks, indicating that most current deterministic defenses achieve nearly 0\% worst-case robustness. We propose a general tight lower bound for randomized smoothing using fractional knapsack solvers or 0-1 knapsack solvers, and using them to bound the worst-case robustness of all stochastic defenses. Based on these solvers, we provide theoretical lower bounds for several previous empirical defenses. For example, we certify the robustness of a specific case, smoothing using a uniform kernel, against \textit{any possible attack} with an average $\ell_0$ perturbation of 2.02 or an average suffix length of 6.41.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present a comprehensive deep learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index (MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively. We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, outperforming existing RGB-based benchmarks. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining multi-resolution imagery, feature augmentation, and optimized training strategies for robust building segmentation in remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>in pr...</summary><p>in preparation for journal submission, 25 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.</p></details> |  |

Deciphering their intricate, hierarchical structures, and diverse functions is essential for advancing our understanding of life at the molecular level. Protein Representation Learning (PRL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling the extraction of meaningful computational representations from protein data to address these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of PRL research, categorizing methodologies into five key areas: feature-based, sequence-based, structure-based, multimodal, and complex-based approaches. To support researchers in this rapidly evolving field, we introduce widely used databases for protein sequences, structures, and functions, which serve as essential resources for model development and evaluation. We also explore the diverse applications of these approaches in multiple domains, demonstrating their broad impact.

| **[Performance Estimation in Binary Classification Using Calibrated Confidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05295v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model monitoring is a critical component of the machine learning lifecycle, safeguarding against undetected drops in the model's performance after deployment. Traditionally, performance monitoring has required access to ground truth labels, which are not always readily available. This can result in unacceptable latency or render performance monitoring altogether impossible. Recently, methods designed to estimate the accuracy of classifier models without access to labels have shown promising results. However, there are various other metrics that might be more suitable for assessing model performance in many cases. Until now, none of these important metrics has received similar interest from the scientific community. In this work, we address this gap by presenting CBPE, a novel method that can estimate any binary classification metric defined using the confusion matrix. In particular, we choose four metrics from this large family: accuracy, precision, recall, and F$_1$, to demonstrate our method. CBPE treats the elements of the confusion matrix as random variables and leverages calibrated confidence scores of the model to estimate their distributions. The desired metric is then also treated as a random variable, whose full probability distribution can be derived from the estimated confusion matrix. CBPE is shown to produce estimates that come with strong theoretical guarantees and valid confidence intervals.</p></details> |  |

In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly. Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5 MTL task-weighting strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Connection Between Learning to Reject and Bhattacharyya Divergences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05273v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to abstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an ideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a hypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal distribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that rejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-T: Table Transformer for Tagging-based Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05271v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences. The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges: overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[A Two-Sample Test of Text Generation Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05269v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in digitized text data requires reliable inferential methods on observed textual patterns. This article proposes a novel two-sample text test for comparing similarity between two groups of documents. The hypothesis is whether the probabilistic mapping generating the textual data is identical across two groups of documents. The proposed test aims to assess text similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set. We showed theoretically that under mild conditions, the test statistic asymptotically follows a normal distribution. A multiple data-splitting strategy is proposed to enhance test power, which combines p-values into a unified decision. Various simulation studies and a real data example demonstrated that the proposed two-sample text test maintains the nominal Type one error rate while offering greater power compared to existing methods. The proposed method provides a novel solution to assert differences in document classes, particularly in fields where large-scale textual information is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with State Modelling and Adversarial Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05262v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents' exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Poster) at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rejection via Learning Density Ratios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18686v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification with rejection emerges as a learning paradigm which allows models to abstain from making predictions. The predominant approach is to alter the supervised learning pipeline by augmenting typical loss functions, letting model rejection incur a lower loss than an incorrect prediction. Instead, we propose a different distributional perspective, where we seek to find an idealized data distribution which maximizes a pretrained model's performance. This can be formalized via the optimization of a loss's risk with a $\varphi$-divergence regularization term. Through this idealized distribution, a rejection decision can be made by utilizing the density ratio between this distribution and the data distribution. We focus on the setting where our $\varphi$-divergences are specified by the family of $\alpha$-divergence. Our framework is tested empirically over clean and noisy datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compa...</summary><p>Compared to published version, a typo in Appendix Section E has been fixed</p></details> |

Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on latent variables for generation. For experimental design or creative applications that require more control over the generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g. interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Linear combinations of Latent variables (LOL) as a general-purpose method to form linear combinations of latent variables that adhere to the assumptions of the generative model. As LOL is easy to implement and naturally addresses the broader task of forming any linear combinations, e.g. the construction of subspaces of the latent space, LOL dramatically simplifies the creation of expressive low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

Stellar flare forecasting can provide additional flare event samples to support research efforts. Despite this potential, no specialized models for stellar flare forecasting have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that both stellar physical properties and historical flare records are valuable inputs for flare forecasting tasks. We then introduce FLARE (Forecasting Light-curve-based Astronomical Records via features Ensemble), the first-of-its-kind large model specifically designed for stellar flare forecasting. FLARE integrates stellar physical properties and historical flare records through a novel Soft Prompt Module and Residual Record Fusion Module. Our experiments on the publicly available Kepler light curve dataset demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance compared to other methods across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we validate the forecast capability of our model through a comprehensive case study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, its success largely depends on large-scale, high-quality labeled datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain due to the need for expert annotation. To mitigate this limitation, label-efficient deep learning methods have emerged to improve model performance under limited supervision by leveraging labeled, unlabeled, and weakly labeled data. In this survey, we systematically review over 350 peer-reviewed studies and present a comprehensive taxonomy of label-efficient learning methods in MIA. These methods are categorized into four labeling paradigms: no label, insufficient label, inexact label, and label refinement. For each category, we analyze representative techniques across imaging modalities and clinical applications, highlighting shared methodological principles and task-specific adaptations. We also examine the growing role of health foundation models (HFMs) in enabling label-efficient learning through large-scale pre-training and transfer learning, enhancing the use of limited annotations in downstream tasks. Finally, we identify current challenges and future directions to facilitate the translation of label-efficient learning from research promise to everyday clinical care.</p></details> | Under Review |

To that aim, we generated a database with 996 entries, which includes up to 7 variables regarding both the manufacturing process and environmental conditions for more than 180 days. Then, we relied on a software framework that brings together a conglomeration of automated ML protocols that execute sequentially against our database by simply command-line interface. This easily permits hyper-optimizing and randomizing seeds of the ML models through exhaustive benchmarking so that optimal models are obtained. The accuracy achieved reaches values of the coefficient determination (R2) widely exceeding 0.90, whereas the root mean squared error (RMSE), sum of squared error (SSE), and mean absolute error (MAE)>1% of the target value, the PCE. Additionally, we contribute with validated models able to screen the behavior of OSCs never seen in the database. In that case, R2~0.96-0.97 and RMSE~1%, thus confirming the reliability of the proposal to predict. For comparative purposes, classical Bayesian regression fitting based on non-linear mean squares (LMS) are also presented, which only perform sufficiently for univariate cases of single OSCs. Hence they fail to outperform the breadth of the capabilities shown by the ML models. Finally, thanks to the standardized results offered by the ML framework, we study the dependencies between the variables of the dataset and their implications for the optimal performance and stability of the OSCs. Reproducibility is ensured by a standardized report altogether with the dataset, which are publicly available at Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Symbolic World Models via Test-time Scaling of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04728v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving complex planning problems requires Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly model the state transition to avoid rule violations, comply with constraints, and ensure optimality-a task hindered by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50\% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR2025 (32 pages, 6 figures)</p></details> |

Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Neural Network Verification through Hierarchical Safety Abstract Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05235v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for formal verification (FV) of deep neural networks (DNNs) are constrained by a binary encoding of safety properties, where a model is classified as either safe or unsafe (robust or not robust). This binary encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs, providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN. Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach. Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard DNN-Verification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, this complexity poses computational challenges, requiring a balance between model performance and acceptable response times for online services. Traditional methods often utilize filtering techniques. These techniques can lead to the loss of significant information by prioritizing top K items based on item attributes or employing low-precision attention mechanisms. In this study, we introduce LREA, a novel attention mechanism that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches while ensuring computational efficiency. LREA leverages low-rank matrix decomposition to optimize runtime performance and incorporates a specially designed loss function to maintain attention capabilities while preserving information integrity. During the inference phase, matrix absorption and pre-storage strategies are employed to effectively meet runtime constraints. The results of extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by SIGIR 2025 Short Paper Track</p></details> |

However, recently several works raise the security issues of 3D deep models. Although most of them consider adversarial attacks, we identify that backdoor attack is indeed a more serious threat to 3D deep learning systems but remains unexplored. We present the backdoor attacks in 3D point cloud with a unified framework that exploits the unique properties of 3D data and networks. In particular, we design two attack approaches on point cloud: the poison-label backdoor attack (PointPBA) and the clean-label backdoor attack (PointCBA). The first one is straightforward and effective in practice, while the latter is more sophisticated assuming there are certain data inspections. The attack algorithms are mainly motivated and developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples suggesting the vulnerability of deep models under spatial transformation; 2) the proposed feature disentanglement technique that manipulates the feature of the data through optimization methods and its potential to embed a new task. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the PointPBA with over 95% success rate across various 3D datasets and models, and the more stealthy PointCBA with around 50% success rate. Our proposed backdoor attack in 3D point cloud is expected to perform as a baseline for improving the robustness of 3D deep models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2021</p></details> |

In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper accepted to the Proceedings of the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-2025)</p></details> |

Yet, unknown or varying symmetries can lead to overconstrained weights and decreased performance. To address this, this paper introduces a probabilistic method to learn the degree of equivariance in SCNNs. We parameterise the degree of equivariance as a likelihood distribution over the transformation group using Fourier coefficients, offering the option to model layer-wise and shared equivariance. These likelihood distributions are regularised to ensure an interpretable degree of equivariance across the network. Advantages include the applicability to many types of equivariant networks through the flexible framework of SCNNs and the ability to learn equivariance with respect to any subgroup of any compact group without requiring additional layers. Our experiments reveal competitive performance on datasets with mixed symmetries, with learnt likelihood distributions that are representative of the underlying degree of equivariance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, published at ICML 2024 as main conference paper</p></details> |

We design suitable resource management techniques that can simultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale appropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such models are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their training reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such, GFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that update the surrogate model and swiftly discover suitable solutions. We provide simulation results showing that our method can allocate radio resources achieving 20% performance gains against benchmarks, while requiring less than half of the number of acquisition rounds.</p></details> |  |

Up to now, no conceptual model exists covering privacy statements from different smartwatch manufacturers that is reusable for developers. This paper introduces such a conceptual model for privacy policies of smartwatches and shows its use in a model-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data visualization of wearable privacy policies from different smartwatch manufacturers. We have analyzed the privacy policies of various manufacturers and extracted the relevant concepts. Moreover, we have checked the model with lawyers for its correctness, instantiated it with concrete data, and used it in a model-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data visualization. This reusable privacy policy model can enable developers to easily represent privacy policies in their systems. This provides a foundation for more structured and understandable privacy policies which, in the long run, can increase the data sovereignty of application users.</p></details> |  |

It categorizes the research into three perspectives: robustness, aiming to design models resilient to "gaming"; fairness, analyzing the societal impacts of such systems; and improvement/causality, recognizing situations where strategic actions lead to genuine personal or societal improvement. The paper introduces a unified framework encapsulating models for these perspectives, including offline, online, and causal settings, and highlights key challenges such as differentiating between gaming and improvement and addressing heterogeneity among agents. By synthesizing findings from diverse works, we outline theoretical advancements and practical solutions for robust, fair, and causally-informed incentive-aware ML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This literature review was published in SIGEcom Exchanges in 2025</p></details> |
| **[LAPSO: A Unified Optimization View for Learning-Augmented Power System Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05203v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components. All code and data are available at https://github.com/xuwkk/lapso_exp.</p></details> |  |

However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the lack of large-scale, diverse, and standardized datasets tailored to physics-based simulations. While existing initiatives provide valuable contributions, many are limited in scope-focusing on specific physics domains, relying on fragmented tooling, or adhering to overly simplistic datamodels that restrict generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce PLAID (Physics-Learning AI Datamodel), a flexible and extensible framework for representing and sharing datasets of physics simulations. PLAID defines a unified standard for describing simulation data and is accompanied by a library for creating, reading, and manipulating complex datasets across a wide range of physical use cases (gitlab.com/drti/plaid). We release six carefully crafted datasets under the PLAID standard, covering structural mechanics and computational fluid dynamics, and provide baseline benchmarks using representative learning methods. Benchmarking tools are made available on Hugging Face, enabling direct participation by the community and contribution to ongoing evaluation efforts (huggingface.co/PLAIDcompetitions).</p></details> |  |

By modifying only a small fraction of tokens within item descriptions -- for instance, adding emotional keywords or borrowing phrases from semantically related items -- an attacker can significantly promote or demote targeted items. We formalize these attacks under token-edit and semantic-similarity constraints, and we examine their effectiveness in both promotion (long-tail items) and demotion (short-head items) scenarios. Our experiments on MovieLens, using two large language model (LLM) retrieval modules, show that even subtle attacks shift final rankings and item exposures while eluding naive detection. The results underscore the vulnerability of RAG-based pipelines to small-scale metadata rewrites and emphasize the need for robust textual consistency checks and provenance tracking to thwart stealthy provider-side poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept-Based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05195v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by explaining predictions through human-understandable concepts but typically assume that training and test data share the same distribution. This assumption often fails under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization. To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IEEE TMI</p></details> |

These physical constraints cannot be fully addressed through advancements in control algorithms alone. Drawing inspiration from the winged flying squirrel, this paper proposes a highly maneuverable drone equipped with agility-enhancing foldable wings. By leveraging collaborative control between the conventional propeller system and the foldable wings-coordinated through the Thrust-Wing Coordination Control (TWCC) framework-the controllable acceleration set is expanded, enabling the generation of abrupt vertical forces that are unachievable with traditional wingless drones. The complex aerodynamics of the foldable wings are modeled using a physics-assisted recurrent neural network (paRNN), which calibrates the angle of attack (AOA) to align with the real aerodynamic behavior of the wings. The additional air resistance generated by appropriately deploying these wings significantly improves the tracking performance of the proposed "flying squirrel" drone. The model is trained on real flight data and incorporates flat-plate aerodynamic principles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed flying squirrel drone achieves a 13.1% improvement in tracking performance, as measured by root mean square error (RMSE), compared to a conventional wingless drone.

| **[Data-Driven Merton's Strategies via Policy Randomization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11797v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Merton's expected utility maximization problem in an incomplete market, characterized by a factor process in addition to the stock price process, where all the model primitives are unknown. The agent under consideration is a price taker who has access only to the stock and factor value processes and the instantaneous volatility. We propose an auxiliary problem in which the agent can invoke policy randomization according to a specific class of Gaussian distributions, and prove that the mean of its optimal Gaussian policy solves the original Merton problem. With randomized policies, we are in the realm of continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) recently developed in Wang et al. (2020) and Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2022b, 2023), enabling us to solve the auxiliary problem in a data-driven way without having to estimate the model primitives. Specifically, we establish a policy improvement theorem based on which we design both online and offline actor-critic RL algorithms for learning Merton's strategies. A key insight from this study is that RL in general and policy randomization in particular are useful beyond the purpose for exploration -- they can be employed as a technical tool to solve a problem that cannot be otherwise solved by mere deterministic policies. At last, we carry out both simulation and empirical studies in a stochastic volatility environment to demonstrate the decisive outperformance of the devised RL algorithms in comparison to the conventional model-based, plug-in method.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Attention-Based Model for 5G Radio-based Outdoor Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23810v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio-based localization in dynamic environments, such as urban and vehicular settings, requires systems that efficiently adapt to varying signal conditions and environmental changes. Factors like multipath interference and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations, which also results in reduced execution time and smaller model size. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a single-layer perceptron. This enables seamless transitions between specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing accuracy and computational complexity. We design three low-complex models tailored for distinct scenarios, and a router that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station and compared to more general models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p></details> |  |

The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Accpeted |

However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively.

| **[PaniCar: Securing the Perception of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems Against Emergency Vehicle Lighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05183v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety of autonomous cars has come under scrutiny in recent years, especially after 16 documented incidents involving Teslas (with autopilot engaged) crashing into parked emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, and firetrucks). While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources often introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image quality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear. In this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object detector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when exposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a significant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect objects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be exploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving assistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3, "manufacturer C", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors (YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle lighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental factors. We also evaluate four SOTA flare removal methods and show that their performance and latency are insufficient for real-time driving constraints. To mitigate this risk, we propose Caracetamol, a robust framework designed to enhance the resilience of object detectors against the effects of activated emergency vehicle lighting. Our evaluation shows that on YOLOv3 and Faster RCNN, Caracetamol improves the models' average confidence of car detection by 0.20, the lower confidence bound by 0.33, and reduces the fluctuation range by 0.33. In addition, Caracetamol is capable of processing frames at a rate of between 30-50 FPS, enabling real-time ADAS car detection.</p></details> |  |

In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2). What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics. We release the code at https://github.com/huacong/OpenworldAUC</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICML2025</p></details> |

Domain knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid') and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory: Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role: Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension; LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory, detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy. Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference; Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets; Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.</p></details> |  |

Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

| **[Benchmarking Open-Source Large Language Models on Healthcare Text Classification Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15169v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of large language models (LLMs) to healthcare information extraction has emerged as a promising approach. This study evaluates the classification performance of five open-source LLMs: GEMMA-3-27B-IT, LLAMA3-70B, LLAMA4-109B, DEEPSEEK-R1-DISTILL-LLAMA-70B, and DEEPSEEK-V3-0324-UD-Q2_K_XL, across six healthcare-related classification tasks involving both social media data (breast cancer, changes in medication regimen, adverse pregnancy outcomes, potential COVID-19 cases) and clinical data (stigma labeling, medication change discussion). We report precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals for all model-task combinations. Our findings reveal significant performance variability between LLMs, with DeepSeekV3 emerging as the strongest overall performer, achieving the highest F1 scores in four tasks. Notably, models generally performed better on social media tasks compared to clinical data tasks, suggesting potential domain-specific challenges. GEMMA-3-27B-IT demonstrated exceptionally high recall despite its smaller parameter count, while LLAMA4-109B showed surprisingly underwhelming performance compared to its predecessor LLAMA3-70B, indicating that larger parameter counts do not guarantee improved classification results. We observed distinct precision-recall trade-offs across models, with some favoring sensitivity over specificity and vice versa. These findings highlight the importance of task-specific model selection for healthcare applications, considering the particular data domain and precision-recall requirements rather than model size alone. As healthcare increasingly integrates AI-driven text classification tools, this comprehensive benchmarking provides valuable guidance for model selection and implementation while underscoring the need for continued evaluation and domain adaptation of LLMs in healthcare contexts.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, recent research highlights that deterministic embeddings from standard VLMs often struggle to capture the uncertainties arising from the ambiguities in visual and textual descriptions and the multiple possible correspondences between images and texts. Existing approaches tackle this by learning probabilistic embeddings during VLM training, which demands large datasets and does not leverage the powerful representations already learned by large-scale VLMs like CLIP. In this paper, we propose GroVE, a post-hoc approach to obtaining probabilistic embeddings from frozen VLMs. GroVE builds on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) to learn a shared low-dimensional latent space where image and text inputs are mapped to a unified representation, optimized through single-modal embedding reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. Once trained, the Gaussian Process model generates uncertainty-aware probabilistic embeddings. Evaluation shows that GroVE achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty calibration across multiple downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and active learning.</p></details> | UAI 2025, 22 pages |

However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP) can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy, (ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii) propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on 6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

We rigorously prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |

We demonstrate, via real data analysis, that common differentially private multivariate mean estimators may not perform well as the aggregator, even in large datasets, motivating our developments.We show that the modified winsorized mean is minimax optimal for several, large classes of distributions, even under adversarial contamination. We also demonstrate that, empirically, the private modified winsorized mean performs well compared to other private mean estimates. We consider the modified winsorized mean as the aggregator in subsample-and-aggregate, deriving a finite sample deviations bound for a subsample-and-aggregate estimate generated with the new aggregator. This result yields two important insights: (i) the optimal choice of subsamples depends on the bias of the estimator computed on the subsamples, and (ii) the rate of convergence of the subsample-and-aggregate estimator depends on the robustness of the estimator computed on the subsamples.</p></details> | 45 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Recursive Inference Scaling: A Winning Path to Scalable Inference in Language and Multimodal Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07503v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time in language and multimodal systems. RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding In-context Learning of Addition via Activation Subspaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05145v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Sparse Training from Random Initialization: Aligning Lottery Ticket Masks using Weight Symmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05143v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests there exists a sparse LTH mask and weights that achieve the same generalization performance as the dense model while using significantly fewer parameters. However, finding a LTH solution is computationally expensive, and a LTH sparsity mask does not generalize to other random weight initializations. Recent work has suggested that neural networks trained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo permutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss basin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks do not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH mask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training from a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in generalization when sparse training from random initialization with the permuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and ResNet50).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Not Another Imputation Method: A Transformer-based Model for Missing Values in Tabular Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11540v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling missing values in tabular datasets presents a significant challenge in training and testing artificial intelligence models, an issue usually addressed using imputation techniques. Here we introduce "Not Another Imputation Method" (NAIM), a novel transformer-based model specifically designed to address this issue without the need for traditional imputation techniques. NAIM's ability to avoid the necessity of imputing missing values and to effectively learn from available data relies on two main techniques: the use of feature-specific embeddings to encode both categorical and numerical features also handling missing inputs; the modification of the masked self-attention mechanism to completely mask out the contributions of missing data. Additionally, a novel regularization technique is introduced to enhance the model's generalization capability from incomplete data. We extensively evaluated NAIM on 5 publicly available tabular datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over 6 state-of-the-art machine learning models and 5 deep learning models, each paired with 3 different imputation techniques when necessary. The results highlight the efficacy of NAIM in improving predictive performance and resilience in the presence of missing data. To facilitate further research and practical application in handling missing data without traditional imputation methods, we made the code for NAIM available at https://github.com/cosbidev/NAIM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Research on Anomaly Detection Methods Based on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05137v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining, with significant applications in cybersecurity, industrial fault diagnosis, and clinical disease monitoring. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling and machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling complex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse data modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models in anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 table |
| **[A Unified Data Representation Learning for Non-parametric Two-sample Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00613v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective data representations has been crucial in non-parametric two-sample testing. Common approaches will first split data into training and test sets and then learn data representations purely on the training set. However, recent theoretical studies have shown that, as long as the sample indexes are not used during the learning process, the whole data can be used to learn data representations, meanwhile ensuring control of Type-I errors. The above fact motivates us to use the test set (but without sample indexes) to facilitate the data representation learning in the testing. To this end, we propose a representation-learning two-sample testing (RL-TST) framework. RL-TST first performs purely self-supervised representation learning on the entire dataset to capture inherent representations (IRs) that reflect the underlying data manifold. A discriminative model is then trained on these IRs to learn discriminative representations (DRs), enabling the framework to leverage both the rich structural information from IRs and the discriminative power of DRs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-TST outperforms representative approaches by simultaneously using data manifold information in the test set and enhancing test power via finding the DRs with the training set.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures.

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms effectively help designers identify trade-offs among the desired non-functional properties. To reduce the use of computational resources, this work examines the impact of implementing a search budget to limit the search for design alternatives. In particular, we analyze how time budgets affect the quality of Pareto fronts by utilizing quality indicators and exploring the structural features of the generated design alternatives. This study identifies distinct behavioral differences among evolutionary algorithms when a search budget is implemented. It further reveals that design alternatives generated under a budget are structurally different from those produced without one. Additionally, we offer recommendations for designers on selecting algorithms in relation to time constraints, thereby facilitating the effective application of automated refactoring to improve non-functional properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.08385</p></details> |
| **[Pairwise Markov Chains for Volatility Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11838v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Pairwise Markov Chain (PMC) is a probabilistic graphical model extending the well-known Hidden Markov Model. This model, although highly effective for many tasks, has been scarcely utilized for continuous value prediction. This is mainly due to the issue of modeling observations inherent in generative probabilistic models. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for prediction with the PMC. On the one hand, this algorithm allows circumventing the feature problem, thus fully exploiting the capabilities of the PMC. On the other hand, it enables the PMC to extend any predictive model by introducing hidden states, updated at each time step, and allowing the introduction of non-stationarity for any model. We apply the PMC with its new algorithm for volatility forecasting, which we compare to the highly popular GARCH(1,1) and feedforward neural models across numerous pairs. This is particularly relevant given the regime changes that we can observe in volatility. For each scenario, our algorithm enhances the performance of the extended model, demonstrating the value of our approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Conversational Process Model Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05453v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign. However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.</p></details> |  |

These methods face two challenges: (1) the retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed independently for each event without considering their possible relationship. In this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet effective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we propose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively leverage possible connections between different events and thus capture relevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further analysis shows the impact of different components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper in COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10729v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference.

| **[Enhancing Differential Testing With LLMs For Testing Deep Learning Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07944v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by ACM TOSEM.

The absence of comprehensive best practices for feature toggle usage often results in improper implementation, causing code quality issues. Although certain feature toggle usage patterns are prone to toggle smells, there is no tool as of today for software engineers to detect toggle usage patterns from the source code. This paper presents a tool TS-Detector to detect five different toggle usage patterns across ten open-source software projects in six different programming languages. We conducted a manual evaluation and results show that the true positive rates of detecting Spread, Nested, and Dead toggles are 80%, 86.4%, and 66.6% respectively, and the true negative rate of Mixed and Enum usages was 100%.

The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain</p></details> |  |

ChemRxivQuest was constructed using an automated pipeline that combines optical character recognition (OCR), GPT-4o-based QA generation, and a fuzzy matching technique for answer verification. The dataset emphasizes conceptual, mechanistic, applied, and experimental questions, enabling applications in retrieval-based QA systems, search engine development, and fine-tuning of domain-adapted large language models. We analyze the dataset's structure, coverage, and limitations, and outline future directions for expansion and expert validation.

To better communicate privacy policies for smartwatches, we need an in-depth understanding of their concepts and provide better ways to enable developers to integrate them when engineering systems. Up to now, no conceptual model exists covering privacy statements from different smartwatch manufacturers that is reusable for developers. This paper introduces such a conceptual model for privacy policies of smartwatches and shows its use in a model-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data visualization of wearable privacy policies from different smartwatch manufacturers. We have analyzed the privacy policies of various manufacturers and extracted the relevant concepts. Moreover, we have checked the model with lawyers for its correctness, instantiated it with concrete data, and used it in a model-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data visualization. This reusable privacy policy model can enable developers to easily represent privacy policies in their systems. This provides a foundation for more structured and understandable privacy policies which, in the long run, can increase the data sovereignty of application users.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided.

| **[OpenworldAUC: Towards Unified Evaluation and Optimization for Open-world Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05180v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning adapts Vision-Language Models like CLIP to open-world tasks with minimal training costs. In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2). What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics. We release the code at https://github.com/huacong/OpenworldAUC</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICML2025</p></details> |

Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms effectively help designers identify trade-offs among the desired non-functional properties. To reduce the use of computational resources, this work examines the impact of implementing a search budget to limit the search for design alternatives. In particular, we analyze how time budgets affect the quality of Pareto fronts by utilizing quality indicators and exploring the structural features of the generated design alternatives. This study identifies distinct behavioral differences among evolutionary algorithms when a search budget is implemented. It further reveals that design alternatives generated under a budget are structurally different from those produced without one. Additionally, we offer recommendations for designers on selecting algorithms in relation to time constraints, thereby facilitating the effective application of automated refactoring to improve non-functional properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.08385</p></details> |

Cypher, a powerful query language for graph databases, enables efficient modeling and querying. Recent advancements in large language models allow translation of natural language questions into Cypher queries - Text2Cypher. A common approach is incorporating database schema into prompts. However, complex schemas can introduce noise, increase hallucinations, and raise computational costs. Schema filtering addresses these challenges by including only relevant schema elements, improving query generation while reducing token costs. This work explores various schema filtering methods for Text2Cypher task and analyzes their impact on token length, performance, and cost. Results show that schema filtering effectively optimizes Text2Cypher, especially for smaller models. Consistent with prior research, we find that larger models benefit less from schema filtering due to their longer context capabilities. However, schema filtering remains valuable for both larger and smaller models in cost reduction.</p></details> |  |

(2025), I show that within their suite of research-engineering tasks the performance of AI agents on longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical model -- a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do the task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length of the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life. This empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent at different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the data is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that they involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails the task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is unknown and an important subject for further work.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Early identification is necessary to prompt intervention, but it remains a challenging task. This study aims to address this challenge by combining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this discovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework that: a) constructs two networks based on disease coding, including the patient network and the disease difference network. Three comorbidity network features were generated based on the basic difference network to capture the potential relationship between comorbidities and risk diseases; b) incorporates computational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL was developed to predict the risks of diabetes and coronary heart disease in patients; and c) analysis the comorbidity patterns and exploring the pathways of disease progression, the pathological pathogenesis of diabetes and coronary heart disease may be revealed. The results show that the network features extracted based on the difference network are important, and the framework we proposed provides more accurate predictions than other strong models in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Beyond technical aspects, CSE also encompasses business activities like continuous planning, budgeting, and operational processes. Coordinating these activities in large-scale product development involves multiple stakeholders, increasing complexity. This study aims to address this complexity by identifying and analyzing critical dependencies in large-scale CSE. Based on 17 semi-structured interviews conducted at two Nordic fintech companies, our preliminary findings indicate that dependencies between software teams and support functions, as well as between software teams and external entities, are the primary sources of delays and bottlenecks. As a next step, we plan to further refine our understanding of critical dependencies in large-scale CSE and explore coordination mechanisms that can better support software development teams in managing these challenges.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research predominantly concentrates on the security of general large language models, lacking specialized methodologies for establishing safety benchmarks and input moderation tailored to embodied agents. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel input moderation framework, meticulously designed to safeguard embodied agents. This framework encompasses the entire pipeline, including taxonomy definition, dataset curation, moderator architecture, model training, and rigorous evaluation. Notably, we introduce EAsafetyBench, a meticulously crafted safety benchmark engineered to facilitate both the training and stringent assessment of moderators specifically designed for embodied agents. Furthermore, we propose Pinpoint, an innovative prompt-decoupled input moderation scheme that harnesses a masked attention mechanism to effectively isolate and mitigate the influence of functional prompts on moderation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets and models validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve an impressive average detection accuracy of 94.58%, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques, alongside an exceptional moderation processing time of merely 0.002 seconds per instance.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, existing benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish (Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

Despite their impressive capabilities, they still face practical deployment issues, such as high inference costs, limited accessibility of proprietary LCMs, and adaptability issues of ultra-large LCMs. These issues highlight the critical need for more accessible, lightweight yet effective LCMs. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, which transfers the programming capabilities of larger, advanced LCMs to smaller, less powerful LCMs. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Paced knOwledge DistillAtion framework, named SODA, aiming at developing lightweight yet effective student LCMs. SODA consists of three stages in one cycle: (1) Correct-and-Fault Knowledge Delivery stage aims at improving the student models capability to recognize errors while ensuring its basic programming skill during the knowledge transferring, which involves correctness-aware supervised learning and fault-aware contrastive learning methods. (2) Multi-View Feedback stage aims at measuring the quality of results generated by the student model from two views, including model-based and static tool-based measurement, for identifying the difficult questions. (3) Feedback-based Knowledge Update stage aims at updating the student model adaptively by generating new questions at different difficulty levels, in which the difficulty levels are categorized based on the feedback in the second stage. Experimental results show that SODA improves the student model by 65.96% in terms of average Pass@1, outperforming the best baseline by 29.85%. Based on the SODA framework, we develop SodaCoder, a series of lightweight yet effective LCMs, which outperform 15 LCMs with less than or equal to 16B parameters. Notably, SodaCoder-DS-6.7B, built on DeepseekCoder-6.7B, even surpasses the prominent ChatGPT on average Pass@1.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 |

Previously, Group Recommender Systems (GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in: Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP Adjunct '25), June 16--19, 2025, New York City, NY, USA Accepted at the 4th Workshop on Group Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (GMAP), co-located at UMAP 2025</p></details> |

Our innovation includes (1) a hierarchical multi-index retrieval system with specialized indices for different simulation aspects, (2) a dependency-aware file generation system that provides consistency management across configuration files, and (3) an iterative error correction mechanism that diagnoses and resolves simulation failures without human intervention.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.</p></details> |  |

However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.</p></details> |  |

However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as captions or mathematical formulas, remains largely untested, posing significant challenges for applications requiring exact textual accuracy. In this work, we introduce T2VTextBench, the first human-evaluation benchmark dedicated to evaluating on-screen text fidelity and temporal consistency in text-to-video models. Our suite of prompts integrates complex text strings with dynamic scene changes, testing each model's ability to maintain detailed instructions across frames. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art systems, ranging from open-source solutions to commercial offerings, and find that most struggle to generate legible, consistent text.

The dataset encodes 37,710 pairwise comparisons across 13,462 images, structured along six criteria - Accessibility, Safety, Comfort, Invitingness, Inclusivity, and Diversity - derived from 634 community-defined concepts. Using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL to reflect multi-criteria spatial preferences and evaluate the LIVS dataset and the fine-tuned model through four case studies: (1) DPO increases alignment with annotated preferences, particularly when annotation volume is high; (2) preference patterns vary across participant identities, underscoring the need for intersectional data; (3) human-authored prompts generate more distinctive visual outputs than LLM-generated ones, influencing annotation decisiveness; and (4) intersectional groups assign systematically different ratings across criteria, revealing the limitations of single-objective alignment. While DPO improves alignment under specific conditions, the prevalence of neutral ratings indicates that community values are heterogeneous and often ambiguous. LIVS provides a benchmark for developing T2I models that incorporate local, stakeholder-driven preferences, offering a foundation for context-aware alignment in spatial design.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity, Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable alternative to conventional approaches.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

Existing compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning, risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection, which fails to intervene effectively during generation. In this work, we introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task accuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether, and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2 outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research, and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |

Despite these advantages, they exhibit significant safety deficiencies. Research conducted by Robust Intelligence, a subsidiary of Cisco, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that DeepSeek-R1 has a 100\% attack success rate when processing harmful prompts. Additionally, multiple safety companies and research institutions have confirmed critical safety vulnerabilities in this model. As models demonstrating robust performance in Chinese and English, DeepSeek models require equally crucial safety assessments in both language contexts. However, current research has predominantly focused on safety evaluations in English environments, leaving a gap in comprehensive assessments of their safety performance in Chinese contexts. In response to this gap, this study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a Chinese-specific safety evaluation benchmark. This benchmark systematically evaluates the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese contexts, revealing their performance across safety categories. The experimental results quantify the deficiencies of these two models in Chinese contexts, providing key insights for subsequent improvements. It should be noted that, despite our efforts to establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation benchmark, the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution, and the setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases into the evaluation results.

| **[Physics-informed solution reconstruction in elasticity and heat transfer using the explicit constraint force method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04875v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One use case of ``physics-informed neural networks'' (PINNs) is solution reconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical system from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations, the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data lead to different ``constraint forces" -- which we define as additional source terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured system.</p></details> |  |

The existing methods suffer from multi-stage procedures along with significant engineering efforts and human expertise. The Only-Train-Once (OTO) series has been recently proposed to resolve the many pain points by streamlining the workflow by automatically conducting (i) search space generation, (ii) structured sparse optimization, and (iii) sub-network construction. However, the built-in sparse optimizers in the OTO series, i.e., the Half-Space Projected Gradient (HSPG) family, have limitations that require hyper-parameter tuning and the implicit controls of the sparsity exploration, consequently requires intervening by human expertise. To address such limitations, we propose a Hybrid Efficient Structured Sparse Optimizer (HESSO). HESSO could automatically and efficiently train a DNN to produce a high-performing subnetwork. Meanwhile, it is almost tuning-free and enjoys user-friendly integration for generic training applications. To address another common issue of irreversible performance collapse observed in pruning DNNs, we further propose a Corrective Redundant Identification Cycle (CRIC) for reliably identifying indispensable structures. We numerically demonstrate the efficacy of HESSO and its enhanced version HESSO-CRIC on a variety of applications ranging from computer vision to natural language processing, including large language model. The numerical results showcase that HESSO can achieve competitive even superior performance to varying state-of-the-arts and support most DNN architectures. Meanwhile, CRIC can effectively prevent the irreversible performance collapse and further enhance the performance of HESSO on certain applications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

To fully exploit this methodology at scale, we introduce Persona Hub -- a collection of 1 billion diverse personas automatically curated from web data. These 1 billion personas (~13% of the world's total population), acting as distributed carriers of world knowledge, can tap into almost every perspective encapsulated within the LLM, thereby facilitating the creation of diverse synthetic data at scale for various scenarios. By showcasing Persona Hub's use cases in synthesizing high-quality mathematical and logical reasoning problems, instructions (i.e., user prompts), knowledge-rich texts, game NPCs and tools (functions) at scale, we demonstrate persona-driven data synthesis is versatile, scalable, flexible, and easy to use, potentially driving a paradigm shift in synthetic data creation and applications in practice, which may have a profound impact on LLM research and development.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[PR2: Peephole Raw Pointer Rewriting with LLMs for Translating C to Safer Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04852v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.</p></details> |  |

This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed recurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas where AI support can improve visualization design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE VIS2025</p></details> |

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a way to assist scientists by improving the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing this influx of information. However, scaling RAG to handle millions of articles introduces significant challenges, including the high computational costs associated with parsing documents and embedding scientific knowledge, as well as the algorithmic complexity of aligning these representations with the nuanced semantics of scientific content. To address these issues, we introduce HiPerRAG, a RAG workflow powered by high performance computing (HPC) to index and retrieve knowledge from more than 3.6 million scientific articles. At its core are Oreo, a high-throughput model for multimodal document parsing, and ColTrast, a query-aware encoder fine-tuning algorithm that enhances retrieval accuracy by using contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques. HiPerRAG delivers robust performance on existing scientific question answering benchmarks and two new benchmarks introduced in this work, achieving 90% accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA-outperforming both domain-specific models like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4. Scaling to thousands of GPUs on the Polaris, Sunspot, and Frontier supercomputers, HiPerRAG delivers million document-scale RAG workflows for unifying scientific knowledge and fostering interdisciplinary innovation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference (PASC 25), June 16-18, 2025, Brugg-Windisch, Switzerland</p></details> |
| **[The Design Space of Lockfiles Across Package Managers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04834v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software developers reuse third-party packages that are hosted in package registries. At build time, a package manager resolves and fetches the direct and indirect dependencies of a project. Most package managers also generate a lockfile, which records the exact set of resolved dependency versions. Lockfiles are used to reduce build times; to verify the integrity of resolved packages; and to support build reproducibility across environments and time. Despite these beneficial features, developers often struggle with their maintenance, usage, and interpretation. In this study, we unveil the major challenges related to lockfiles, such that future researchers and engineers can address them. We perform the first comprehensive study of lockfiles across 7 popular package managers, npm, pnpm, Cargo, Poetry, Pipenv, Gradle, and Go. First, we highlight how the content and functions of lockfiles differ across package managers and ecosystems. Next, we conduct a qualitative analysis based on semi-structured interviews with 15 developers. We capture first-hand insights about the benefits that developers perceive in lockfiles, as well as the challenges they face to manage these files. Following these observations, we make 4 recommendations to further improve lockfiles, for a better developer experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guide your favorite protein sequence generative model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04823v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative machine learning models have begun to transform protein engineering, yet no principled framework for conditioning on auxiliary information in a plug-and-play manner exists; one may want to iteratively incorporate experimental feedback, or make use of an existing classifier -- such as for predicting enzyme commission number -- in order to guide the sampling of the generative model to generate sequences with desired properties. Herein, we present ProteinGuide, a rigorous and general framework to achieve just that: through unifying a broad class of protein generative models that includes masked language, (order-agnostic) autoregressive, diffusion and flow-matching models, we provide an approach to statistically condition pre-trained protein generative models. We demonstrate applicability of our approach by guiding each of two commonly used protein generative models, ProteinMPNN and ESM3, to generate amino acid and structure token sequences conditioned on several user-specified properties, namely, enhanced stability and CATH-labeled fold generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Protecting Privacy in Software Logs: What Should Be Anonymized?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11313v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software logs, generated during the runtime of software systems, are essential for various development and analysis activities, such as anomaly detection and failure diagnosis. However, the presence of sensitive information in these logs poses significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers that could lead to re-identification risks. While general data privacy has been extensively studied, the specific domain of privacy in software logs remains underexplored, with inconsistent definitions of sensitivity and a lack of standardized guidelines for anonymization. To mitigate this gap, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of privacy in software logs from multiple perspectives. We start by performing an analysis of 25 publicly available log datasets to identify potentially sensitive attributes. Based on the result of this step, we focus on three perspectives: privacy regulations, research literature, and industry practices. We first analyze key data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to understand the legal requirements concerning sensitive information in logs. Second, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify common privacy attributes and practices in log anonymization, revealing gaps in existing approaches. Finally, we survey 45 industry professionals to capture practical insights on log anonymization practices. Our findings shed light on various perspectives of log privacy and reveal industry challenges, such as technical and efficiency issues while highlighting the need for standardized guidelines. By combining insights from regulatory, academic, and industry perspectives, our study aims to provide a clearer framework for identifying and protecting sensitive information in software logs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact nonlinear state estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10976v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The majority of data assimilation (DA) methods in the geosciences are based on Gaussian assumptions. While these assumptions facilitate efficient algorithms, they cause analysis biases and subsequent forecast degradations. Non-parametric, particle-based DA algorithms have superior accuracy, but their application to high-dimensional models still poses operational challenges. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), this article introduces a new nonlinear estimation theory which attempts to bridge the existing gap in DA methodology. Specifically, a Conjugate Transform Filter (CTF) is derived and shown to generalize the celebrated Kalman filter to arbitrarily non-Gaussian distributions. The new filter has several desirable properties, such as its ability to preserve statistical relationships in the prior state and convergence to highly accurate observations. An ensemble approximation of the new theory (ECTF) is also presented and validated using idealized statistical experiments that feature bounded quantities with non-Gaussian distributions, a prevalent challenge in Earth system models. Results from these experiments indicate that the greatest benefits from ECTF occur when observation errors are small relative to the forecast uncertainty and when state variables exhibit strong nonlinear dependencies. Ultimately, the new filtering theory offers exciting avenues for improving conventional DA algorithms through their principled integration with AI techniques.</p></details> |  |

This has led to the emergence of AI for Software Engineering as a distinct research area within software engineering. With the development of quantum computing, the field of Quantum AI (QAI) is arising, enhancing the performance of classical AI and holding significant potential for solving classical software engineering problems. Some initial applications of QAI in software engineering have already emerged, such as software test optimization. However, the path ahead remains open, offering ample opportunities to solve complex software engineering problems with QAI cost-effectively. To this end, this paper presents open research opportunities and challenges in QAI for software engineering that need to be addressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Proposal for Evaluating the Operational Risk for ChatBots based on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04784v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled more advanced chatbots capable of human-like interactions. However, these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak, an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational systems.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Effectively analyzing these reviews is essential for guiding app development, prioritizing feature updates, and enhancing user satisfaction. Classifying reviews into functional and non-functional requirements play a pivotal role in distinguishing feedback related to specific app features (functional requirements) from feedback concerning broader quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability (non-functional requirements). Both categories are integral to informed development decisions. Traditional approaches to classifying app reviews are hindered by the need for large, domain-specific datasets, which are often costly and time-consuming to curate. This study explores the potential of zero-shot learning with ChatGPT for classifying app reviews into four categories: functional requirement, non-functional requirement, both, or neither. We evaluate ChatGPT's performance on a benchmark dataset of 1,880 manually annotated reviews from ten diverse apps spanning multiple domains. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT achieves a robust F1 score of 0.842 in review classification, despite certain challenges and limitations. Additionally, we examine how factors such as review readability and length impact classification accuracy and conduct a manual analysis to identify review categories more prone to misclassification.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Bad Data Leads to Good Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04741v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality" from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity. First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model, it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention (ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into account, bad data may lead to good models.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with 84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.</p></details> |  |

This can be crucial for tasks such as patent matching, legal or compliance case retrieval, and academic literature review. Existing retrieval methods, including keyword search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen. We provide a comparative analysis of our proposed methods in terms of cost, speed, and the human interface with the domain experts. The methods we compare leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) which can incorporate domain expert input to produce document scores and rankings, as well as explanations for human review. The process and methods for it that we present can significantly reduce human effort in dataset creation for custom domains while still obtaining sufficient expert knowledge for tuning retrieval models. We evaluate our methods on QBD datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and finetune the parameters of the BM25 model -- which is used in many industrial-strength search engines like OpenSearch -- using the generated data.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[On Synthetic Texture Datasets: Challenges, Creation, and Curation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10297v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of textures on machine learning models has been an ongoing investigation, specifically in texture bias/learning, interpretability, and robustness. However, due to the lack of large and diverse texture data available, the findings in these works have been limited, as more comprehensive evaluations have not been feasible. Image generative models are able to provide data creation at scale, but utilizing these models for texture synthesis has been unexplored and poses additional challenges both in creating accurate texture images and validating those images. In this work, we introduce an extensible methodology and corresponding new dataset for generating high-quality, diverse texture images capable of supporting a broad set of texture-based tasks. Our pipeline consists of: (1) developing prompts from a range of descriptors to serve as input to text-to-image models, (2) adopting and adapting Stable Diffusion pipelines to generate and filter the corresponding images, and (3) further filtering down to the highest quality images. Through this, we create the Prompted Textures Dataset (PTD), a dataset of 362,880 texture images that span 56 textures. During the process of generating images, we find that NSFW safety filters in image generation pipelines are highly sensitive to texture (and flag up to 60\% of our texture images), uncovering a potential bias in these models and presenting unique challenges when working with texture data. Through both standard metrics and a human evaluation, we find that our dataset is high quality and diverse. Our dataset is available for download at https://zenodo.org/records/15359142.</p></details> |  |

Prior scene layout generation methods are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn in image editing applications.</p></details> |  |

Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We find that VLMs align conceptually equivalent inputs into a shared task vector, which is invariant to modality (text, image) and format (examples, instruction), and may simplify VLM processing. We measure this alignment via cross-modal transfer -- the ability of a task vector derived in one modality to trigger the correct generation in another -- on a range of tasks and model architectures. Although the task vector is highly compressed, we find that this single vector outperforms prompting the model with the full task information, unique to this cross-modal case. Furthermore, we show that task vectors can be transferred from a base language model to its fine-tuned vision-language counterpart, and that they can be derived solely from instructions without the need for examples. Taken together, our findings shed light on how VLMs internally process task information, and how they map different modalities into common semantic representations.

While SDS was initially designed for text-to-3D generation using image diffusion, its core idea of distilling a powerful generative prior into a separate parametric representation extends to the audio domain. Leveraging a single pretrained model, Audio-SDS enables a broad range of tasks without requiring specialized datasets. In particular, we demonstrate how Audio-SDS can guide physically informed impact sound simulations, calibrate FM-synthesis parameters, and perform prompt-specified source separation. Our findings illustrate the versatility of distillation-based methods across modalities and establish a robust foundation for future work using generative priors in audio tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>See t...</summary><p>See the project website at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/Audio-SDS/</p></details> |

With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs. However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations. First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages. Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues. Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues. In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain. OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues. Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images. The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information. Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ISSTA'25</p></details> |

These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution. In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures; clarify relation to indirect prompt injection attacks</p></details> |

Traditional numerical methods struggle with the exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic domains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with dimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net, an efficient neural surrogate that overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high dimensions. Unlike hyperspheres, where the internal volume diminishes as dimensionality increases, hypercubes retain or expand their volume (for unit or larger length), making high-dimensional computations significantly more demanding. Anant-Net efficiently incorporates high-dimensional boundary conditions and minimizes the PDE residual at high-dimensional collocation points. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold networks into the Anant-Net architecture. We benchmark Anant-Net's performance on several linear and nonlinear high-dimensional equations, including the Poisson, Sine-Gordon, and Allen-Cahn equations, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across randomly sampled test points from high-dimensional space. Importantly, Anant-Net achieves these results with remarkable efficiency, solving 300-dimensional problems on a single GPU within a few hours. We also compare Anant-Net's results for accuracy and runtime with other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings establish Anant-Net as an accurate, interpretable, and scalable framework for efficiently solving high-dimensional PDEs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |

This attack vector particularly threatens open-source models with parameter-level access. Existing defenses targeting supervised fine-tuning prove ineffective against RL's dynamic feedback mechanisms. We introduce Reward Neutralization, the first defense framework specifically designed against RL fine-tuning attacks, establishing concise rejection patterns that render malicious reward signals ineffective. Our approach trains models to produce minimal-information rejections that attackers cannot exploit, systematically neutralizing attempts to optimize toward harmful outputs. Experiments validate that our approach maintains low harmful scores (no greater than 2) after 200 attack steps, while standard models rapidly deteriorate. This work provides the first constructive proof that robust defense against increasingly accessible RL attacks is achievable, addressing a critical security gap for open-weight models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Componential Prompt-Knowledge Alignment for Domain Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04575v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) aims to learn from non-stationary data streams across domains while retaining and utilizing past knowledge. Although prompt-based methods effectively store multi-domain knowledge in prompt parameters and obtain advanced performance through cross-domain prompt fusion, we reveal an intrinsic limitation: component-wise misalignment between domain-specific prompts leads to conflicting knowledge integration and degraded predictions. This arises from the random positioning of knowledge components within prompts, where irrelevant component fusion introduces interference.To address this, we propose Componential Prompt-Knowledge Alignment (KA-Prompt), a novel prompt-based DIL method that introduces component-aware prompt-knowledge alignment during training, significantly improving both the learning and inference capacity of the model. KA-Prompt operates in two phases: (1) Initial Componential Structure Configuring, where a set of old prompts containing knowledge relevant to the new domain are mined via greedy search, which is then exploited to initialize new prompts to achieve reusable knowledge transfer and establish intrinsic alignment between new and old prompts. (2) Online Alignment Preservation, which dynamically identifies the target old prompts and applies adaptive componential consistency constraints as new prompts evolve. Extensive experiments on DIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our KA-Prompt.

This introduces human-on-the-loop requirements, where evolving needs shape ongoing system functionality and behaviors. While traditional personas support upfront, static requirements elicitation, we propose a persona-based advocate framework for runtime requirements engineering to provide ethically informed, safety-driven, and regulatory-aware decision support. Our approach extends standard personas into event-driven personas. When triggered by events such as adverse environmental conditions, evolving mission state, or operational constraints, the framework updates the sUAS operator's view of the personas, ensuring relevance to current conditions. We create three key advocate personas, namely Safety Controller, Ethical Governor, and Regulatory Auditor, to manage trade-offs among risk, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. We perform a proof-of-concept validation in an emergency response scenario using sUAS, showing how our advocate personas provide context-aware guidance grounded in safety, regulatory, and ethical constraints. By evolving static, design-time personas into adaptive, event-driven advocates, the framework surfaces mission-critical runtime requirements in response to changing conditions. These requirements shape operator decisions in real time, aligning actions with the operational demands of the moment.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

While these models have demonstrated transformative potential in productivity and communication, they overwhelmingly cater to high-resource languages like English. This has amplified concerns over linguistic inequality in natural language processing (NLP). This paper presents the first systematic review focused specifically on strategies to address data scarcity in generative language modelling for low-resource languages (LRL). Drawing from 54 studies, we identify, categorise and evaluate technical approaches, including monolingual data augmentation, back-translation, multilingual training, and prompt engineering, across generative tasks. We also analyse trends in architecture choices, language family representation, and evaluation methods. Our findings highlight a strong reliance on transformer-based models, a concentration on a small subset of LRLs, and a lack of consistent evaluation across studies. We conclude with recommendations for extending these methods to a wider range of LRLs and outline open challenges in building equitable generative language systems. Ultimately, this review aims to support researchers and developers in building inclusive AI tools for underrepresented languages, a necessary step toward empowering LRL speakers and the preservation of linguistic diversity in a world increasingly shaped by large-scale language technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is currently under review.

However, a general yet concrete formulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development of AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability is rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes existing FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified problem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer verification for better human-alignment. The expressiveness, soundness and completeness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on problem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500 benchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP benchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and human-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by formal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting methods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving.</p></details> | 42 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Edge-GPU Based Face Tracking for Face Detection and Recognition Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04524v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cost-effective machine vision systems dedicated to real-time and accurate face detection and recognition in public places are crucial for many modern applications. However, despite their high performance, which could be reached using specialized edge or cloud AI hardware accelerators, there is still room for improvement in throughput and power consumption. This paper aims to suggest a combined hardware-software approach that optimizes face detection and recognition systems on one of the latest edge GPUs, namely NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. First, it leverages the simultaneous usage of all its hardware engines to improve processing time. This offers an improvement over previous works where these tasks were mainly allocated automatically and exclusively to the CPU or, to a higher extent, to the GPU core. Additionally, the paper suggests integrating a face tracker module to avoid redundantly running the face recognition algorithm for every frame but only when a new face appears in the scene. The results of extended experiments suggest that simultaneous usage of all the hardware engines that are available in the Orin GPU and tracker integration into the pipeline yield an impressive throughput of 290 FPS (frames per second) on 1920 x 1080 input size frames containing in average of 6 faces/frame. Additionally, a substantial saving of power consumption of around 800 mW was achieved when compared to running the task on the CPU/GPU engines only and without integrating a tracker into the Orin GPU\'92s pipeline. This hardware-codesign approach can pave the way to design high-performance machine vision systems at the edge, critically needed in video monitoring in public places where several nearby cameras are usually deployed for a same scene.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

These models assist programmers in generating code, potentially increasing productivity and efficiency. However, the environmental impact of utilising these AI models is substantial, given their high energy consumption during both training and inference stages. This research aims to compare the energy consumption of manual software development versus an LLM-assisted approach, using Codeforces as a simulation platform for software development. The goal is to quantify the environmental impact and propose strategies for minimising the carbon footprint of using LLM in software development. Our results show that the LLM-assisted code generation leads on average to 32.72 higher carbon footprint than the manual one. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between task complexity and the difference in the carbon footprint of the two approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite their significant value, designing and managing CPI is intricate; they evolve with rapidly changing business contexts and present comprehension and explanation challenges for end-users. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) emerges as a potent solution to overcome these hurdles and ensure CPI adoption, though its application to CPI remains an understudied research area. While prior efforts targeted specific CPI modeling objectives, a comprehensive overview of literature advancements is lacking. This study addresses this gap by conducting a scoping review yielding dual outcomes: (1) a comprehensive mapping of modeling features in the literature and (2) a comparative analysis of the coverage offered by the modeling frameworks. These outcomes enhance CPI understanding in academic and practitioner circles and offer insights for future MDE CPI advancements.</p></details> |  |

To tackle the substantial challenge of addressing hallucinations for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark dataset called OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from the TBox (i.e. schema-matching) datasets in the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are carefully classified into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset in constructing the LLM leaderboard and fine-tuning foundational LLMs for LLM-based OM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 2 prompt templates</p></details> |
| **[Towards Effectively Leveraging Execution Traces for Program Repair with Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04441v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising performance on various programming tasks, including Automatic Program Repair (APR). However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Checkification: A Practical Approach for Testing Static Analysis Truths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12093v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis is an essential component of many modern software development tools. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing complexity of static analyzers makes their coding error-prone. Even analysis tools based on rigorous mathematical techniques, such as abstract interpretation, are not immune to bugs. Ensuring the correctness and reliability of software analyzers is critical if they are to be inserted in production compilers and development environments. While compiler validation has seen notable success, formal validation of static analysis tools remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for testing abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Broadly, it consists in checking, over a suite of benchmarks, that the properties inferred statically are satisfied dynamically. The main advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity, which stems directly from framing it within the Ciao assertion-based validation framework, and its blended static/dynamic assertion checking approach. We demonstrate that in this setting, the analysis can be tested with little effort by combining the following components already present in the framework: 1) the static analyzer, which outputs its results as the original program source with assertions interspersed; 2) the assertion run-time checking mechanism, which instruments a program to ensure that no assertion is violated at run time; 3) the random test case generator, which generates random test cases satisfying the properties present in assertion preconditions; and 4) the unit-test framework, which executes those test cases. We have applied our approach to the CiaoPP static analyzer, resulting in the identification of many bugs with reasonable overhead. Most of these bugs have been either fixed or confirmed, helping us detect a range of errors not only related to analysis soundness but also within other aspects of the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Light Control in Intelligent Transportation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03669v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart traffic lights in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are envisioned to greatly increase traffic efficiency and reduce congestion. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to adaptively control traffic lights based on the real-time traffic situation in a road network. However, conventional methods may suffer from poor scalability. In this paper, we investigate deep reinforcement learning to control traffic lights, and both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the intelligent behavior ``greenwave" (i.e., a vehicle will see a progressive cascade of green lights, and not have to brake at any intersection) emerges naturally a grid road network, which is proved to be the optimal policy in an avenue with multiple cross streets. As a first step, we use two DRL algorithms for the traffic light control problems in two scenarios. In a single road intersection, we verify that the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm delivers a thresholding policy; and in a grid road network, we adopt the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Secondly, numerical experiments show that the DQN algorithm delivers the optimal control, and the DDPG algorithm with passive observations has the capability to produce on its own a high-level intelligent behavior in a grid road network, namely, the ``greenwave" policy emerges. We also verify the ``greenwave" patterns in a $5 \times 10$ grid road network. Thirdly, the ``greenwave" patterns demonstrate that DRL algorithms produce favorable solutions since the ``greenwave" policy shown in experiment results is proved to be optimal in a specified traffic model (an avenue with multiple cross streets). The delivered policies both in a single road intersection and a grid road network demonstrate the scalability of DRL algorithms.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Existing solutions typically rely on two-stage retrieval or indirect modeling paradigms, incuring upstream-downstream inconsistency and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for GPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism for stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with lightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic complexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training with mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the fully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based dense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising and e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness and industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at more than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users.</p></details> |  |

Typically, the performance of LLMs is measured on benchmarks with small or medium-sized context windows of thousands of lines of code. At the same time, in real-world software projects, repositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by contributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The benchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large repositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of functions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies, docstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper presents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at function body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not covered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large repositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC. Third, we contribute a scalable evaluation pipeline for efficient computing of the target metrics and a tool for visual analysis of generated code. Overall, these three aspects allow for evaluating code generation in large repositories in C and C++.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at LLM4Code 2025 Workshop co-located wtih ICSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-Context Adaptation to Concept Drift for Learned Database Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04404v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has demonstrated transformative potential for database operations, such as query optimization and in-database data analytics. However, dynamic database environments, characterized by frequent updates and evolving data distributions, introduce concept drift, which leads to performance degradation for learned models and limits their practical applicability. Addressing this challenge requires efficient frameworks capable of adapting to shifting concepts while minimizing the overhead of retraining or fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose FLAIR, an online adaptation framework that introduces a new paradigm called \textit{in-context adaptation} for learned database operations. FLAIR leverages the inherent property of data systems, i.e., immediate availability of execution results for predictions, to enable dynamic context construction. By formalizing adaptation as $f:(\mathbf{x} \,| \,\mathcal{C}_t) \to \mathbf{y}$, with $\mathcal{C}_t$ representing a dynamic context memory, FLAIR delivers predictions aligned with the current concept, eliminating the need for runtime parameter optimization. To achieve this, FLAIR integrates two key modules: a Task Featurization Module for encoding task-specific features into standardized representations, and a Dynamic Decision Engine, pre-trained via Bayesian meta-training, to adapt seamlessly using contextual information at runtime. Extensive experiments across key database tasks demonstrate that FLAIR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 5.2x faster adaptation and reducing error by 22.5% for cardinality estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, most multi-interest SR models rely on noisy, sparse implicit feedback, limiting recommendation accuracy. Large language models (LLMs) offer robust reasoning on low-quality data but face high computational costs and latency challenges for SR integration. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-interest SR framework combining implicit behavioral and explicit semantic perspectives. It includes two modules: the Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM), which learns from user behavior using a traditional SR model, and the Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM), which uses clustering and prompt-engineered LLMs to extract semantic multi-interest representations from informative samples. Semantic insights from ESIM enhance IBIM's behavioral representations via modality alignment and semantic prediction tasks. During inference, only IBIM is used, ensuring efficient, LLM-free recommendations. Experiments on four real-world datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

In addition, we propose a knowledge reservoir validated by a human-in-loop approach, achieving accurate concept linking for future applications while minimizing computational costs. For four diverse datasets, CDE-Mapper achieved an average of 7.2\% higher accuracy improvement compared to baseline methods.

Defect taxonomies are valuable tools for this, offering a common language for issues and enabling systematic tracking. A significant prior study developed such a taxonomy, but based it exclusively on the declarative language Puppet. It remained unknown whether this taxonomy applies to programming language-based IaC (PL-IaC) tools like Pulumi, Terraform CDK, and AWS CDK. Aim: We replicated this foundational work to assess the generalizability of the taxonomy across a broader and more diverse landscape. Method: We performed qualitative analysis on 3,364 defect-related commits from 285 open-source PL-IaC repositories (PIPr dataset) to derive a PL-IaC-specific defect taxonomy. We then enhanced the ACID tool, originally developed for the prior study, to automatically classify and analyze defect distributions across an expanded dataset-447 open-source repositories and 94 proprietary projects from VTEX (e-commerce) and Nubank (financial). Results: Our research confirmed the same eight defect categories identified in the original study, with idempotency and security defects appearing infrequently but persistently across projects. Configuration Data defects maintain high frequency in both open-source and proprietary codebases. Conclusions: Our replication supports the generalizability of the original taxonomy, suggesting IaC development challenges surpass organizational boundaries. Configuration Data defects emerge as a persistent high-frequency problem, while idempotency and security defects remain important concerns despite lower frequency. These patterns appear consistent across open-source and proprietary projects, indicating they are fundamental to the IaC paradigm itself, transcending specific tools or project types.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

R-B is a promising approach to increase the integrity of the software supply chain, when installing open source software built by third parties. Unfortunately, despite success stories like high build reproducibility levels in Debian packages, uncertainty remains among field experts on the scalability of R-B to very large package repositories. In this work, we perform the first large-scale study of bitwise reproducibility, in the context of the Nix functional package manager, rebuilding 709 816 packages from historical snapshots of the nixpkgs repository, the largest cross-ecosystem open source software distribution, sampled in the period 2017-2023. We obtain very high bitwise reproducibility rates, between 69 and 91% with an upward trend, and even higher rebuildability rates, over 99%. We investigate unreproducibility causes, showing that about 15% of failures are due to embedded build dates. We release a novel dataset with all build statuses, logs, as well as full ''diffoscopes'': recursive diffs of where unreproducible build artifacts differ.</p></details> |  |

| **[Verification of Digital Twins using Classical and Statistical Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04322v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of digital techniques, the concept of digital twin (DT) has received a widespread attention in both industry and academia. While several definitions exist for a DT, most definitions focus on the existence of a virtual entity (VE) of a real-world object or process, often comprising interconnected models which interact with each other, undergoing changes continuously owing to the synchronization with the real-world object. These interactions might lead to inconsistencies at execution time, due to their highly stochastic and/or time-critical nature, which may lead to undesirable behavior. In addition, the continuously varying nature of VE owing to its synchronization with the real-world object further contributes to the complexity arising from these interactions and corresponding model execution times, which could possibly affect its overall functioning at runtime. This creates a need to perform (continuous) verification of the VE, to ensure that it behaves consistently at runtime by adhering to desired properties such as deadlock freeness, functional correctness, liveness and timeliness. Some critical properties such as deadlock freeness can only be verified using classical model checking; on the other hand, statistical model checking provides the possibility to model actual stochastic temporal behavior. We therefore propose to use both these techniques to verify the correctness and the fulfillment of desirable properties of VE. We present our observations and findings from applying these techniques on the DT of an autonomously driving truck. Results from these verification techniques suggest that this DT adheres to properties of deadlock freeness and functional correctness, but not adhering to timeliness properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ASQAP 2025, arXiv:2505.02873</p></details> |

The central research question that motivates this work is: How can unstructured, often tacit, human expertise be effectively transformed into computationally tractable algorithms that AI systems can efficiently utilise? KERAIA seeks to bridge this gap by building on foundational concepts such as Minsky's frame-based reasoning and K-lines, while introducing significant innovations. These include Clouds of Knowledge for dynamic aggregation, Dynamic Relations (DRels) for context-sensitive inheritance, explicit Lines of Thought (LoTs) for traceable reasoning, and Cloud Elaboration for adaptive knowledge transformation. This approach moves beyond the limitations of traditional, often static, knowledge representation paradigms. KERAIA is designed with Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle, ensuring transparency and interpretability, particularly through the use of LoTs. The paper details the framework's architecture, the KSYNTH representation language, and the General Purpose Paradigm Builder (GPPB) to integrate diverse inference methods within a unified structure. We validate KERAIA's versatility, expressiveness, and practical applicability through detailed analysis of multiple case studies spanning naval warfare simulation, industrial diagnostics in water treatment plants, and strategic decision-making in the game of RISK. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis against established knowledge representation paradigms (including ontologies, rule-based systems, and knowledge graphs) and discuss the implementation aspects and computational considerations of the KERAIA platform.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[How the Misuse of a Dataset Harmed Semantic Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04311v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BigCloneBench is a well-known and widely used large-scale dataset for the evaluation of recall of clone detection tools. It has been beneficial for research on clone detection and has become a standard in evaluating the performance of clone detection tools. More recently, it has also been widely used as a dataset to evaluate machine learning approaches to semantic clone detection or code similarity detection for functional or semantic similarity. This paper demonstrates that BigCloneBench is problematic to use as ground truth for learning or evaluating semantic code similarity, and highlights the aspects of BigCloneBench that affect the ground truth quality. A manual investigation of a statistically significant random sample of 406 Weak Type-3/Type-4 clone pairs revealed that 93% of them do not have a similar functionality and are therefore mislabelled. In a literature review of 179 papers that use BigCloneBench as a dataset, we found 139 papers that used BigCloneBench to evaluate semantic clone detection and where the results are threatened in their validity by the mislabelling. As such, these papers often report high F1 scores (e.g., above 0.9), which indicates overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts rather than genuine semantic similarity detection. We emphasise that using BigCloneBench remains valid for the intended purpose of evaluating syntactic or textual clone detection of Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3 clones. We acknowledge the important contributions of BigCloneBench to two decades of traditional clone detection research. However, the usage of BigCloneBench beyond the intended purpose without careful consideration of its limitations has led to misleading results and conclusions, and potentially harmed the field of semantic clone detection.</p></details> |  |

According to the results, the propagation sequences have been complex in general, although GitHub, Debian, and Ubuntu stand out. Furthermore, the associated propagation delays have been lengthy, and these do not correlate well with the number of ecosystems involved in the associated sequences. Nor does the presence or absence of particularly ecosystems in the sequences yield clear, interpretable patterns. With these results, the paper contributes to the overlapping knowledge bases about software ecosystems, traceability, and vulnerabilities.</p></details> | Submitted to ICTSS |

We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages plus 2 pages of supplemental material</p></details> |

To address this gap, we conducted qualitative research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these systems. Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Despite their impressive adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic variations. Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To lower barriers and increase engagement, OSS projects have dedicated experts who provide guidance for newcomers. However, timely responses are often hindered by experts' busy schedules. The recent rapid advancements of AI in software engineering have brought opportunities to leverage AI as a substitute for expert mentoring. However, the potential role of AI as a comprehensive mentor throughout the entire onboarding process remains unexplored. To identify design strategies of this ``AI mentor'', we applied Design Fiction as a participatory method with 19 OSS newcomers. We investigated their current onboarding experience and elicited 32 design strategies for future AI mentor. Participants envisioned AI mentor being integrated into OSS platforms like GitHub, where it could offer assistance to newcomers, such as ``recommending projects based on personalized requirements'' and ``assessing and categorizing project issues by difficulty''. We also collected participants' perceptions of a prototype, named ``OSSerCopilot'', that implemented the envisioned strategies. They found the interface useful and user-friendly, showing a willingness to use it in the future, which suggests the design strategies are effective. Finally, in order to identify the gaps between our design strategies and current research, we conducted a comprehensive literature review, evaluating the extent of existing research support for this concept. We find that research is relatively scarce in certain areas where newcomers highly anticipate AI mentor assistance, such as ``discovering an interested project''. Our study has the potential to revolutionize the current newcomer-expert mentorship and provides valuable insights for researchers and tool designers aiming to develop and enhance AI mentor systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auto.gov: Learning-based Governance for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09551v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an integral component of the blockchain ecosystem, enabling a range of financial activities through smart-contract-based protocols. Traditional DeFi governance typically involves manual parameter adjustments by protocol teams or token holder votes, and is thus prone to human bias and financial risks, undermining the system's integrity and security. While existing efforts aim to establish more adaptive parameter adjustment schemes, there remains a need for a governance model that is both more efficient and resilient to significant market manipulations. In this paper, we introduce "Auto$.$gov", a learning-based governance framework that employs a deep Qnetwork (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to perform semi-automated, data-driven parameter adjustments. We create a DeFi environment with an encoded action-state space akin to the Aave lending protocol for simulation and testing purposes, where Auto$.$gov has demonstrated the capability to retain funds that would have otherwise been lost to price oracle attacks. In tests with real-world data, Auto$.$gov outperforms the benchmark approaches by at least 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold, in terms of the preset performance metric--protocol profitability. Overall, the comprehensive evaluations confirm that Auto$.$gov is more efficient and effective than traditional governance methods, thereby enhancing the security, profitability, and ultimately, the sustainability of DeFi protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steerable Chatbots: Personalizing LLMs with Preference-Based Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04260v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) improve in their capacity to serve as personal AI assistants, their ability to output uniquely tailored, personalized responses that align with the soft preferences of their users is essential for enhancing user satisfaction and retention. However, untrained lay users have poor prompt specification abilities and often struggle with conveying their latent preferences to AI assistants. To address this, we leverage activation steering to guide LLMs to align with interpretable preference dimensions during inference. In contrast to memory-based personalization methods that require longer user history, steering is extremely lightweight and can be easily controlled by the user via an linear strength factor. We embed steering into three different interactive chatbot interfaces and conduct a within-subjects user study (n=14) to investigate how end users prefer to personalize their conversations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of preference-based steering for aligning real-world conversations with hidden user preferences, and highlight further insights on how diverse values around control, usability, and transparency lead users to prefer different interfaces.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of compilation instruction search and error resolution makes automatic compilation challenging. Inspired by the success of LLM-based agents in various fields, we propose CompileAgent, the first LLM-based agent framework dedicated to repo-level compilation. CompileAgent integrates five tools and a flow-based agent strategy, enabling interaction with software artifacts for compilation instruction search and error resolution. To measure the effectiveness of our method, we design a public repo-level benchmark CompileAgentBench, and we also design two baselines for comparison by combining two compilation-friendly schemes. The performance on this benchmark shows that our method significantly improves the compilation success rate, ranging from 10% to 71%. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of CompileAgent under different agent strategies and verify the effectiveness of the flow-based strategy. Additionally, we emphasize the scalability of CompileAgent, further expanding its application prospects.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

This holds true within the field of software engineering (SE) as well. The state-of-the-art research on MAS within SE focuses on integrating LLMs at the core of autonomous agents to create LLM-based multi-agent autonomous (LMA) systems. However, the introduction of LMA systems into SE brings a plethora of challenges. One of the major challenges is the strategic allocation of tasks between humans and the LMA system in a trustworthy manner. To address this challenge, a RACI-based framework is proposed in this work in progress article, along with implementation guidelines and an example implementation of the framework. The proposed framework can facilitate efficient collaboration, ensure accountability, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM-driven automation while aligning with the Trustworthy AI guidelines. The future steps for this work delineating the planned empirical validation method are also presented.</p></details> |  |

However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.</p></details> |  |

Attention modelling is crucial for optimising web design and computational advertising, whereas attention metrics can inform ad placement and revenue strategies. We introduce AdSight, a method leveraging mouse cursor trajectories to quantify in a scalable and accurate manner user attention in multi-slot environments like SERPs. AdSight uses a novel Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture where the encoder processes cursor trajectory embeddings, and the decoder incorporates slot-specific features, enabling robust attention prediction across various SERP layouts. We evaluate our approach on two Machine Learning tasks: (1) regression, to predict fixation times and counts; and (2) classification, to determine some slot types were noticed. Our findings demonstrate the model's ability to predict attention with unprecedented precision, offering actionable insights for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval</p></details> |

Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025; 17 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Despite the success, fine-tuning continues to rely on repeated and lengthy prompts, which escalate computational expenses, require more resources, and lead to slower inference. In this paper, we present a novel approach, PromptIntern, which internalizes prompt knowledge during model fine-tuning to achieve efficient inference and save costs. Instead of compressing the prompts for a vanilla model, PromptIntern aims to embed the recurrent prompt directly into the model parameters. We design a fine-tuning pipeline that includes instruction template compression, few-shot example absorption, and a progressive internalization strategy, effectively diminishing the need for intricate prompts during inference. Comprehensive experiments on challenging NL2Code tasks demonstrate that our method reduces input tokens by more than 90%, accelerates inference by 4.2 times, and reduces monetary inference costs by 88.3%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

In order to solve this vector-valued optimisation problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarisation functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarised problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimisation techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimisation problem into a single-objective optimisation problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem are the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarised optimisation problems. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimisation algorithms. We then analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimisation, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Review 2025. 47 pages.

One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign. However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.</p></details> |  |

Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |

Although there are de facto consensuses on how to share research code (through a git repository linked to from publications) and trained models (via HuggingFace Hub), there is no consensus for other types of artifacts, such as built indexes. Given the practical utility of using shared indexes, researchers have resorted to self-hosting these resources or performing ad hoc file transfers upon request, ultimately limiting the artifacts' discoverability and reuse. This demonstration introduces a flexible and interoperable way to share artifacts for Information Retrieval research, improving both their accessibility and usability.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 (demo) |

In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks.

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |
| **[Threshold Modulation for Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05375v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025. \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages) and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The absence of comprehensive best practices for feature toggle usage often results in improper implementation, causing code quality issues. Although certain feature toggle usage patterns are prone to toggle smells, there is no tool as of today for software engineers to detect toggle usage patterns from the source code. This paper presents a tool TS-Detector to detect five different toggle usage patterns across ten open-source software projects in six different programming languages. We conducted a manual evaluation and results show that the true positive rates of detecting Spread, Nested, and Dead toggles are 80%, 86.4%, and 66.6% respectively, and the true negative rate of Mixed and Enum usages was 100%. The tool can be downloaded from its GitHub repository and can be used following the instructions provided there.</p></details> | <details><summary>33rd ...</summary><p>33rd ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering, June 23--28, 2025, Trondheim, Norway</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Chain of Thoughts via Elastic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05315v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer-based assignment decision network for multiple object tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03571v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/psaltaath/tadn-mot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Personalized Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05223v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style. Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation, limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAPSO: A Unified Optimization View for Learning-Augmented Power System Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05203v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

| **[Biomed-DPT: Dual Modality Prompt Tuning for Biomedical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05189v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively.

| **[OpenworldAUC: Towards Unified Evaluation and Optimization for Open-world Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05180v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning adapts Vision-Language Models like CLIP to open-world tasks with minimal training costs. In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2). What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics.

| **[Not Another Imputation Method: A Transformer-based Model for Missing Values in Tabular Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11540v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling missing values in tabular datasets presents a significant challenge in training and testing artificial intelligence models, an issue usually addressed using imputation techniques. Here we introduce "Not Another Imputation Method" (NAIM), a novel transformer-based model specifically designed to address this issue without the need for traditional imputation techniques. NAIM's ability to avoid the necessity of imputing missing values and to effectively learn from available data relies on two main techniques: the use of feature-specific embeddings to encode both categorical and numerical features also handling missing inputs; the modification of the masked self-attention mechanism to completely mask out the contributions of missing data. Additionally, a novel regularization technique is introduced to enhance the model's generalization capability from incomplete data. We extensively evaluated NAIM on 5 publicly available tabular datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over 6 state-of-the-art machine learning models and 5 deep learning models, each paired with 3 different imputation techniques when necessary. The results highlight the efficacy of NAIM in improving predictive performance and resilience in the presence of missing data. To facilitate further research and practical application in handling missing data without traditional imputation methods, we made the code for NAIM available at https://github.com/cosbidev/NAIM.</p></details> |  |
| **[USPR: Learning a Unified Solver for Profiled Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05119v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Profiled Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) extends the classical VRP by incorporating vehicle-client-specific preferences and constraints, reflecting real-world requirements such as zone restrictions and service-level preferences. While recent reinforcement learning (RL) solvers have shown promise, they require retraining for each new profile distribution, suffer from poor representation ability, and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution instances. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing USPR (Unified Solver for Profiled Routing), a novel framework that natively handles arbitrary profile types. USPR introduces three key innovations: (i) Profile Embeddings (PE) to encode any combination of profile types; (ii) Multi-Head Profiled Attention (MHPA), an attention mechanism that models rich interactions between vehicles and clients; (iii) Profile-aware Score Reshaping (PSR), which dynamically adjusts decoder logits using profile scores to improve generalization. Empirical results on diverse PVRP benchmarks demonstrate that USPR achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based methods while offering significant gains in flexibility and computational efficiency. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/uspr.</p></details> |  |

Early identification is necessary to prompt intervention, but it remains a challenging task. This study aims to address this challenge by combining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this discovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework that: a) constructs two networks based on disease coding, including the patient network and the disease difference network. Three comorbidity network features were generated based on the basic difference network to capture the potential relationship between comorbidities and risk diseases; b) incorporates computational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL was developed to predict the risks of diabetes and coronary heart disease in patients; and c) analysis the comorbidity patterns and exploring the pathways of disease progression, the pathological pathogenesis of diabetes and coronary heart disease may be revealed. The results show that the network features extracted based on the difference network are important, and the framework we proposed provides more accurate predictions than other strong models in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |

One such task is disparity estimation, estimating the disparity between matching pixels in stereo image pairs, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like medical surgeries and autonomous navigation. However, DL-based disparity estimation methods are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their reliability and generalization. Despite these concerns, a standardized benchmark for evaluating the robustness of disparity estimation methods remains absent, hindering progress in the field. To address this gap, we introduce DispBench, a comprehensive benchmarking tool for systematically assessing the reliability of disparity estimation methods. DispBench evaluates robustness against synthetic image corruptions such as adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution shifts caused by 2D Common Corruptions across multiple datasets and diverse corruption scenarios. We conduct the most extensive performance and robustness analysis of disparity estimation methods to date, uncovering key correlations between accuracy, reliability, and generalization.

| **[Type-Constrained Code Generation with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09246v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code generation. However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because their next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code. Although constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue, it has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or syntactic features of general-purpose programming languages. However, LLMs frequently generate code with typing errors, which are beyond the domain of syntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge, we introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems to guide code generation. For this purpose, we develop novel prefix automata and a search over inhabitable types, forming a sound approach to enforce well-typedness on LLM-generated code. We formalize our approach on a foundational simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate practicality. Our evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP datasets shows that our approach reduces compilation errors by more than half and significantly increases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair tasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including state-of-the-art open-weight models with more than 30B parameters. The results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach in constraining LLM code generation with formal rules of type systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22480v5)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical technique for training large language models. However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed the uncertain reward models to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, and thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that can directly learn the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the uncertainty of the reward distribution. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final performance compared with existing methods. We also find that PURM genuinely produce sound reward and uncertainty estimations.

To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance.

Despite their versatility, existing open-source unified models exhibit performance gaps against domain-specific architectures. To bridge this gap, we present Nexus-Gen, a unified model that synergizes the language reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the image synthesis power of diffusion models. To align the embedding space of the LLM and diffusion model, we conduct a dual-phase alignment training process. (1) The autoregressive LLM learns to predict image embeddings conditioned on multimodal inputs, while (2) the vision decoder is trained to reconstruct high-fidelity images from these embeddings. During training the LLM, we identified a critical discrepancy between the autoregressive paradigm's training and inference phases, where error accumulation in continuous embedding space severely degrades generation quality. To avoid this issue, we introduce a prefilled autoregression strategy that prefills input sequence with position-embedded special tokens instead of continuous embeddings. Through dual-phase training, Nexus-Gen has developed the integrated capability to comprehensively address the image understanding, generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and codes are published at https://github.com/modelscope/Nexus-Gen.git to facilitate further advancements across the field.</p></details> |  |

However, existing utility-centric unlearning metrics (based on model utility) may fail to accurately evaluate the extent of unlearning in realistic settings such as when (a) the forget and retain set have semantically similar content, (b) retraining the model from scratch on the retain set is impractical, and/or (c) the model owner can improve the unlearning metric without directly performing unlearning on the LLM. This paper presents the first data-centric unlearning metric for LLMs called WaterDrum that exploits robust text watermarking for overcoming these limitations. We also introduce new benchmark datasets for LLM unlearning that contain varying levels of similar data points and can be used to rigorously evaluate unlearning algorithms using WaterDrum.

However, existing benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish (Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> |  |

Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in coding and STEM tasks, though reasoning may sometimes improve.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IJCAI 2025, 21 pages, 2 figure</p></details> |
| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

Despite their impressive capabilities, they still face practical deployment issues, such as high inference costs, limited accessibility of proprietary LCMs, and adaptability issues of ultra-large LCMs. These issues highlight the critical need for more accessible, lightweight yet effective LCMs. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, which transfers the programming capabilities of larger, advanced LCMs to smaller, less powerful LCMs. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Paced knOwledge DistillAtion framework, named SODA, aiming at developing lightweight yet effective student LCMs. SODA consists of three stages in one cycle: (1) Correct-and-Fault Knowledge Delivery stage aims at improving the student models capability to recognize errors while ensuring its basic programming skill during the knowledge transferring, which involves correctness-aware supervised learning and fault-aware contrastive learning methods. (2) Multi-View Feedback stage aims at measuring the quality of results generated by the student model from two views, including model-based and static tool-based measurement, for identifying the difficult questions. (3) Feedback-based Knowledge Update stage aims at updating the student model adaptively by generating new questions at different difficulty levels, in which the difficulty levels are categorized based on the feedback in the second stage. Experimental results show that SODA improves the student model by 65.96% in terms of average Pass@1, outperforming the best baseline by 29.85%. Based on the SODA framework, we develop SodaCoder, a series of lightweight yet effective LCMs, which outperform 15 LCMs with less than or equal to 16B parameters. Notably, SodaCoder-DS-6.7B, built on DeepseekCoder-6.7B, even surpasses the prominent ChatGPT on average Pass@1.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 |

However, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the scalable problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs while underutilizing the advantage of on-device SLMs in accessing and processing personalized data. This leads to two interconnected issues: 1) Limited utilization of the problem-solving capabilities of on-cloud LLMs, which fail to align with personalized user-task needs, and 2) Inadequate integration of user data into on-device SLM responses, resulting in mismatches in contextual user information. In this paper, we propose a Leader-Subordinate Retrieval framework for Privacy-preserving cloud-device collaboration (LSRP), a novel solution that bridges these gaps by: 1) enhancing on-cloud LLM guidance to on-device SLM through a dynamic selection of task-specific leader strategies named as user-to-user retrieval-augmented generation (U-U-RAG), and 2) integrating the data advantages of on-device SLMs through small model feedback Direct Preference Optimization (SMFB-DPO) for aligning the on-cloud LLM with the on-device SLM. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that LSRP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving question-answer relevance and personalization, while preserving user privacy through efficient on-device retrieval.

A/B testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS, a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released publicly.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |

Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAM: Continuous Latent Action Models for Robot Learning from Unlabeled Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04999v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robot policies using imitation learning requires collecting large amounts of costly action-labeled expert demonstrations, which fundamentally limits the scale of training data. A promising approach to address this bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way. However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models (CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a) using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and (b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples. Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data, enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl (locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot arm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, remarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best baseline.

We present Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates complex OpenFOAM-based CFD simulation workflows from natural language inputs. Our innovation includes (1) a hierarchical multi-index retrieval system with specialized indices for different simulation aspects, (2) a dependency-aware file generation system that provides consistency management across configuration files, and (3) an iterative error correction mechanism that diagnoses and resolves simulation failures without human intervention. Through comprehensive evaluation on the dataset of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 83.6% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM and 37.3% for OpenFOAM-GPT). Ablation studies demonstrate the critical contribution of each system component, with the specialized error correction mechanism providing a 36.4% performance improvement. Foam-Agent substantially lowers the CFD expertise threshold while maintaining modeling accuracy, demonstrating the potential of specialized multi-agent systems to democratize access to complex scientific simulation tools.

| **[Rethinking Invariance in In-context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04994v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual independence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets, showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.

| **[LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments: When Should We Ask LLMs for Help?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06877v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test collections are information retrieval tools that allow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate ranking algorithms. While test collections have become an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves significant effort in manual annotations, which often makes it very expensive and time-consuming. Thus, test collections could become too small when the budget is limited, which may lead to unstable evaluations. As a cheaper alternative, recent studies have proposed the use of large language models (LLMs) to completely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs seem to somewhat correlate with human judgments, their predictions are not perfect and often show bias. Thus a complete replacement with LLMs is argued to be too risky and not fully reliable. Thus, in this paper, we propose LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments (LARA), an effective method to balance manual annotations with LLM annotations, which helps to build a rich and reliable test collection even under a low budget. We use the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities to select the most profitable documents to manually annotate under a budget constraint. With theoretical reasoning, LARA effectively guides the human annotation process by actively learning to calibrate the LLM's predicted relevance probabilities. Then, using the calibration model learned from the limited manual annotations, LARA debiases the LLM predictions to annotate the remaining non-assessed data. Empirical evaluations on TREC-7 Ad Hoc, TREC-8 Ad Hoc, TREC Robust 2004, and TREC-COVID datasets show that LARA outperforms alternative solutions under almost any budget constraint.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

The most common evaluation framework for MI attacks/defenses relies on an evaluation model that has been utilized to assess progress across almost all MI attacks and defenses proposed in recent years. In this paper, for the first time, we present an in-depth study of MI evaluation. Firstly, we construct the first comprehensive human-annotated dataset of MI attack samples, based on 28 setups of different MI attacks, defenses, private and public datasets. Secondly, using our dataset, we examine the accuracy of the MI evaluation framework and reveal that it suffers from a significant number of false positives. These findings raise questions about the previously reported success rates of SOTA MI attacks. Thirdly, we analyze the causes of these false positives, design controlled experiments, and discover the surprising effect of Type I adversarial features on MI evaluation, as well as adversarial transferability, highlighting a relationship between two previously distinct research areas. Our findings suggest that the performance of SOTA MI attacks has been overestimated, with the actual privacy leakage being significantly less than previously reported. In conclusion, we highlight critical limitations in the widely used MI evaluation framework and present our methods to mitigate false positive rates. We remark that prior research has shown that Type I adversarial attacks are very challenging, with no existing solution. Therefore, we urge to consider human evaluation as a primary MI evaluation framework rather than merely a supplement as in previous MI research. We also encourage further work on developing more robust and reliable automatic evaluation frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our dataset and code are available in the Supp</p></details> |

| **[Learning Item Representations Directly from Multimodal Features for Effective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04960v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional multimodal recommender systems predominantly leverage Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) optimization to learn item representations by amalgamating item identity (ID) embeddings with multimodal features. Nevertheless, our empirical and theoretical findings unequivocally demonstrate a pronounced optimization gradient bias in favor of acquiring representations from multimodal features over item ID embeddings. As a consequence, item ID embeddings frequently exhibit suboptimal characteristics despite the convergence of multimodal feature parameters. Given the rich informational content inherent in multimodal features, in this paper, we propose a novel model (i.e., LIRDRec) that learns item representations directly from these features to augment recommendation performance. Recognizing that features derived from each modality may capture disparate yet correlated aspects of items, we propose a multimodal transformation mechanism, integrated with modality-specific encoders, to effectively fuse features from all modalities. Moreover, to differentiate the influence of diverse modality types, we devise a progressive weight copying fusion module within LIRDRec. This module incrementally learns the weight assigned to each modality in synthesizing the final user or item representations. Finally, we utilize the powerful visual understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to convert the item images into texts and extract semantics embeddings upon the texts via LLMs. Empirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach relative to competing baselines. It is worth noting the proposed model, equipped with embeddings extracted from MLLMs and LLMs, can further improve the recommendation accuracy of NDCG@20 by an average of 4.21% compared to the original embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/enoche/LIRDRec</p></details> |

However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens.

Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias.

Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development.

However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.</p></details> |  |

Importantly, our method strikes a balance by effectively recommending cold start items and handling cold start users without incurring extra bias, and it maintains strong performance in warm settings. Experimental results demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to previous collaborative filtering approaches.

Systematically evaluating LLMs' risk decision-making tendencies and attitudes, particularly in the ethical domain, has become crucial. This study innovatively applies the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale from cognitive science to LLMs and proposes a novel Ethical Decision-Making Risk Attitude Scale (EDRAS) to assess LLMs' ethical risk attitudes in depth. We further propose a novel approach integrating risk scales and role-playing to quantitatively evaluate systematic biases in LLMs. Through systematic evaluation and analysis of multiple mainstream LLMs, we assessed the "risk personalities" of LLMs across multiple domains, with a particular focus on the ethical domain, and revealed and quantified LLMs' systematic biases towards different groups. This research helps understand LLMs' risk decision-making and ensure their safe and reliable application. Our approach provides a tool for identifying and mitigating biases, contributing to fairer and more trustworthy AI systems.

While such technologies offer benefits such as democratizing artistic creation, they also pose challenges in misinformation, digital forgery, and authenticity verification. Additionally, the uncredited use of AI-generated images in media and marketing has sparked significant backlash from online communities. In response to this, we introduce DejAIvu, a Chrome Web extension that combines real-time AI-generated image detection with saliency-based explainability while users browse the web.

As such, with the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning tools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as the Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to date have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed that the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual) vector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge embeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction. This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to link prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs and state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective that models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather than individual nodes and edges. Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis concludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both viable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG transfer learning for the link prediction task.

| **[RouterKT: Mixture-of-Experts for Knowledge Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08989v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which aims to model the dynamic knowledge states of students based on their interaction histories. However, existing KT models often rely on a global forgetting decay mechanism for capturing learning patterns, assuming that students' performance is predominantly influenced by their most recent interactions. Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex learning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning stages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous learning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns without any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay. Specifically, RouterKT introduces a \textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to effectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs \textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse patterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that RouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of various KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\% across different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, RouterKT demonstrates consistently superior inference efficiency compared to existing approaches based on handcrafted learning pattern bias, highlighting its usability for real-world educational applications.

In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation from the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\circ$-resolution ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction model IFS T42.

| **[Agentic Neurodivergence as a Contingent Solution to the AI Alignment Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02581v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about control and existential risk have escalated. Here, we investigate whether embracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a dynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more human-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in this contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce and test change-of-opinion attacks based on this kind of perturbation and intervention analysis to study how agents may neutralise friendly or unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that open models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in proprietary models are successful at steering and controlling to some extent the agents' range of opinion and sentiment change with possible positive and negative consequences in what we believe are signs of a neuro-symbolic approach even if shallow.</p></details> | 45 pages |
| **[PR2: Peephole Raw Pointer Rewriting with LLMs for Translating C to Safer Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04852v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.</p></details> |  |

This is due to the content of existing large training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is arxiv version of the paper which was accepted for the Doklady Mathematics Journal in 2024</p></details> |

However, scenes that satisfy strict task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3) poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five diverse environments.

However, previous dominating MORL methods typically generate a fixed policy set or preference-conditioned policy through multiple training iterations exclusively for sampled preference vectors, and cannot ensure the efficient discovery of the Pareto front. Furthermore, integrating preferences into the input of policy or value functions presents scalability challenges, in particular as the dimension of the state and preference space grow, which can complicate the learning process and hinder the algorithm's performance on more complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage Pareto front discovery algorithm called Constrained MORL (C-MORL), which serves as a seamless bridge between constrained policy optimization and MORL. Concretely, a set of policies is trained in parallel in the initialization stage, with each optimized towards its individual preference over the multiple objectives. Then, to fill the remaining vacancies in the Pareto front, the constrained optimization steps are employed to maximize one objective while constraining the other objectives to exceed a predefined threshold. Empirically, compared to recent advancements in MORL methods, our algorithm achieves more consistent and superior performances in terms of hypervolume, expected utility, and sparsity on both discrete and continuous control tasks, especially with numerous objectives (up to nine objectives in our experiments).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

| **[TLOB: A Novel Transformer Model with Dual Attention for Price Trend Prediction with Limit Order Book Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15757v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Price Trend Prediction (PTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a fundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning, existing models fail to generalize across different market conditions and assets. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we show that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of complex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the horizon bias. We evaluate TLOB's effectiveness across four horizons, using the established FI-2010 benchmark, a NASDAQ and a Bitcoin dataset. TLOB outperforms SoTA methods in every dataset and horizon. Additionally, we empirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time, -6.68 in F1-score, highlighting the growing market efficiency. Predictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial AI. We release the code at https://github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB.</p></details> |  |

However, these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak, an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational systems.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Communicating Activations Between Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14082v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication between multiple language model (LM) agents has been shown to scale up the reasoning ability of LMs. While natural language has been the dominant medium for inter-LM communication, it is not obvious this should be the standard: not only does natural language communication incur high inference costs that scale quickly with the number of both agents and messages, but also the decoding process abstracts away too much rich information that could be otherwise accessed from the internal activations. In this work, we propose a simple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause an LM $\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current activation with another LM $\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some function $\textit{f}$, then pass $\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of $\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete. This approach scales up LMs on new tasks with zero additional parameters and data, and saves a substantial amount of compute over natural language communication. We test our method with various functional forms $\textit{f}$ on two experimental setups--multi-player coordination games and reasoning benchmarks--and find that it achieves up to $27.0\%$ improvement over natural language communication across datasets with $<$$1/4$ the compute, illustrating the superiority and robustness of activations as an alternative "language" for communication between LMs.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

HLS relies on pragmas, which are directives inserted into the source code to guide the synthesis process, and pragmas have various settings and values that significantly impact the resulting hardware design. State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the model, and return the top designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways. To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. CompareXplore introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel node difference attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enabling the model to identify critical pragmas impacting performance. CompareXplore adopts a two-stage DSE, where a pointwise prediction model is used for the initial design pruning, followed by a pairwise comparison stage for precise performance verification. In extensive experiments, compareXplore achieves significant improvements in ranking metrics and generates high-quality HLS results for the selected designs, outperforming the existing SOTA method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in MLCAD 2024</p></details> |
| **[Dual Conic Proxy for Semidefinite Relaxation of AC Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06978v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nonlinear, non-convex AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is fundamental for power systems operations. The intrinsic complexity of AC-OPF has fueled a growing interest in the development of optimization proxies for the problem, i.e., machine learning models that predict high-quality, close-to-optimal solutions. More recently, dual conic proxy architectures have been proposed, which combine machine learning and convex relaxations of AC-OPF, to provide valid certificates of optimality using learning-based methods. Building on this methodology, this paper proposes, for the first time, a dual conic proxy architecture for the semidefinite (SDP) relaxation of AC-OPF problems. Although the SDP relaxation is stronger than the second-order cone relaxation considered in previous work, its practical use has been hindered by its computational cost. The proposed method combines a neural network with a differentiable dual completion strategy that leverages the structure of the dual SDP problem. This approach guarantees dual feasibility, and therefore valid dual bounds, while providing orders of magnitude of speedups compared to interior-point algorithms. The paper also leverages self-supervised learning, which alleviates the need for time-consuming data generation and allows to train the proposed models efficiently. Numerical experiments are presented on several power grid benchmarks with up to 500 buses. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDP-based proxies can outperform weaker conic relaxations, while providing several orders of magnitude speedups compared to a state-of-the-art interior-point SDP solver.</p></details> |  |

The Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) method aims to make data unlearnable by applying class-wise blurs to every image in the dataset so that neural networks learn relations between blur kernels and labels, as opposed to informative features for classifying clean data. In this work, we evaluate whether CUDA data remains unlearnable after image sharpening and frequency filtering, finding that this combination of simple transforms improves the utility of CUDA data for training. In particular, we observe a substantial increase in test accuracy over adversarial training for models trained with CUDA unlearnable data from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100. In training models to high accuracy using unlearnable data, we underscore the need for ongoing refinement in data poisoning techniques to ensure data privacy. Our method opens new avenues for enhancing the robustness of unlearnable datasets by highlighting that simple methods such as sharpening and frequency filtering are capable of breaking convolution-based unlearnable datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AdvML-Frontiers Workshop at NeurIPS 2024.

Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size.

| **[Guaranteed Recovery of Unambiguous Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13093v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the $K$-clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, includes minor changes and some new content compared to previous version</p></details> |

We also explore the specific criteria individuals rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived readability. We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 254 Czech native speakers who identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment. Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely resolved among the feedback group. The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in educational contexts.</p></details> |  |

However, it is often the case that data in spectroscopy is scarce, and this usually causes severe overfitting problems with deep learning methods. Traditional machine learning methods are viable when datasets are smaller, but the accuracy and applicability of these methods is generally more limited. We introduce a deep learning method for classification of molecular spectra based on learning integral operators via integral equations of the first kind, which results in an algorithm that is less affected by overfitting issues on small datasets, compared to other deep learning models. The problem formulation of the deep learning approach is based on inverse problems, which have traditionally found important applications in spectroscopy. We perform experiments on real world data to showcase our algorithm. It is seen that the model outperforms traditional machine learning approaches such as decision tree and support vector machine, and for small datasets it outperforms other deep learning models. Therefore, our methodology leverages the power of deep learning, still maintaining the performance when the available data is very limited, which is one of the main issues that deep learning faces in spectroscopy, where datasets are often times of small size.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages. v2: Link to code repository added.

We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |

To enable such a future by reducing the magnetic field strength, one key approach will be to improve sampling strategies. Previous work has shown that it is possible to make diagnostic decisions directly from k-space with fewer samples. Such work shows that single diagnostic decisions can be made, but if we aspire to see MRI as a true PoC, multiple and sequential decisions are necessary while minimizing the number of samples acquired. We present a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework enabling comprehensive, sequential, diagnostic evaluation from undersampled k-space data. Our approach during inference actively adapts to sequential decisions to optimally sample. To achieve this, we introduce a training methodology that identifies the samples that contribute the best to each diagnostic objective using a step-wise weighting reward function. We evaluate our approach in two sequential knee pathology assessment tasks: ACL sprain detection and cartilage thickness loss assessment. Our framework achieves diagnostic performance competitive with various policy-based benchmarks on disease detection, severity quantification, and overall sequential diagnosis, while substantially saving k-space samples. Our approach paves the way for the future of MRI as a comprehensive and affordable PoC device.

By adjusting exercise difficulty for a specific user throughout the exercise interaction, robots can maximize both the user's rehabilitation outcomes and the their motivation throughout the exercise. Previous approaches have assumed exercises have generic difficulty values that apply to all users equally, however, we identified that stroke survivors have varied and unique perceptions of exercise difficulty. For example, some stroke survivors found reaching vertically more difficult than reaching farther but lower while others found reaching farther more challenging than reaching vertically. In this paper, we formulate a causal tree-based method to calculate exercise difficulty based on the user's performance. We find that this approach accurately models exercise difficulty and provides a readily interpretable model of why that exercise is difficult for both users and caretakers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RAS-EMBS International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR 2025)</p></details> |

Although prompt-based methods effectively store multi-domain knowledge in prompt parameters and obtain advanced performance through cross-domain prompt fusion, we reveal an intrinsic limitation: component-wise misalignment between domain-specific prompts leads to conflicting knowledge integration and degraded predictions. This arises from the random positioning of knowledge components within prompts, where irrelevant component fusion introduces interference.To address this, we propose Componential Prompt-Knowledge Alignment (KA-Prompt), a novel prompt-based DIL method that introduces component-aware prompt-knowledge alignment during training, significantly improving both the learning and inference capacity of the model. KA-Prompt operates in two phases: (1) Initial Componential Structure Configuring, where a set of old prompts containing knowledge relevant to the new domain are mined via greedy search, which is then exploited to initialize new prompts to achieve reusable knowledge transfer and establish intrinsic alignment between new and old prompts. (2) Online Alignment Preservation, which dynamically identifies the target old prompts and applies adaptive componential consistency constraints as new prompts evolve. Extensive experiments on DIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our KA-Prompt.

We also prove that for any representation mapping, the HSCL and Hard-UCL (HUCL) losses are lower bounded by the corresponding SCL and UCL losses. In contrast to existing literature, our theoretical results for SCL do not require class-conditional independence of augmented views and work for a general loss function class that includes the widely used InfoNCE loss function. Moreover, our proofs are simpler, compact, and transparent. Similar to existing literature, our theoretical claims also hold for the practical scenario where batching is used for optimization. We empirically demonstrate, for the first time, that Adam optimization (with batching) of HSCL and HUCL losses with random initialization and suitable hardness levels can indeed converge to the NC-geometry if we incorporate unit-ball or unit-sphere feature normalization. Without incorporating hard-negatives or feature normalization, however, the representations learned via Adam suffer from Dimensional-Collapse (DC) and fail to attain the NC-geometry. These results exemplify the role of hard-negative sampling in contrastive representation learning and we conclude with several open theoretical problems for future work.

It has become an effective training paradigm due to the broader supervision information provided by the teacher distribution compared to one-hot labels. We identify that the core challenge in KD lies in balancing two mode-concentration effects: the \textbf{\textit{Hardness-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with large errors, and the \textbf{\textit{Confidence-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with high student confidence. Through an analysis of how probabilities are reassigned during gradient updates, we observe that these two effects are entangled in FKLD and RKLD, but in extreme forms. Specifically, both are too weak in FKLD, causing the student to fail to concentrate on the target class. In contrast, both are too strong in RKLD, causing the student to overly emphasize the target class while ignoring the broader distributional information from the teacher. To address this imbalance, we propose ABKD, a generic framework with $\alpha$-$\beta$-divergence. Our theoretical results show that ABKD offers a smooth interpolation between FKLD and RKLD, achieving an effective trade-off between these effects. Extensive experiments on 17 language/vision datasets with 12 teacher-student settings confirm its efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/ghwang-s/abkd.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Spotlight |
| **[Boosting Masked ECG-Text Auto-Encoders as Discriminative Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02131v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate interpretation of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is pivotal for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Integrating ECG signals with accompanying textual reports further holds immense potential to enhance clinical diagnostics by combining physiological data and qualitative insights. However, this integration faces significant challenges due to inherent modality disparities and the scarcity of labeled data for robust cross-modal learning. To address these obstacles, we propose D-BETA, a novel framework that pre-trains ECG and text data using a contrastive masked auto-encoder architecture. D-BETA uniquely combines the strengths of generative with boosted discriminative capabilities to achieve robust cross-modal representations. This is accomplished through masked modality modeling, specialized loss functions, and an improved negative sampling strategy tailored for cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on five public datasets across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that D-BETA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving an average AUC improvement of 15% in linear probing with only one percent of training data and 2% in zero-shot performance without requiring training data over state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the effectiveness of D-BETA, underscoring its potential to advance automated clinical diagnostics through multi-modal representations.

However, a general yet concrete formulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development of AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability is rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes existing FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified problem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer verification for better human-alignment. The expressiveness, soundness and completeness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on problem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500 benchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP benchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and human-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by formal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting methods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving.</p></details> | 42 pages, 3 figures |

| **[DFVO: Learning Darkness-free Visible and Infrared Image Disentanglement and Fusion All at Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04526v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible and infrared image fusion is one of the most crucial tasks in the field of image fusion, aiming to generate fused images with clear structural information and high-quality texture features for high-level vision tasks. However, when faced with severe illumination degradation in visible images, the fusion results of existing image fusion methods often exhibit blurry and dim visual effects, posing major challenges for autonomous driving. To this end, a Darkness-Free network is proposed to handle Visible and infrared image disentanglement and fusion all at Once (DFVO), which employs a cascaded multi-task approach to replace the traditional two-stage cascaded training (enhancement and fusion), addressing the issue of information entropy loss caused by hierarchical data transmission. Specifically, we construct a latent-common feature extractor (LCFE) to obtain latent features for the cascaded tasks strategy. Firstly, a details-extraction module (DEM) is devised to acquire high-frequency semantic information. Secondly, we design a hyper cross-attention module (HCAM) to extract low-frequency information and preserve texture features from source images. Finally, a relevant loss function is designed to guide the holistic network learning, thereby achieving better image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Particularly, DFVO can generate clearer, more informative, and more evenly illuminated fusion results in the dark environments, achieving best performance on the LLVIP dataset with 63.258 dB PSNR and 0.724 CC, providing more effective information for high-level vision tasks. Our code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaVin-Qi530/DFVO.</p></details> |  |

This algorithm explores the game tree by iteratively expanding the most promising sequences of actions based on the current partial game tree. We first evaluate the use of transposition tables, which convert the game tree into a directed acyclic graph by merging duplicate states. Second, we compare the original algorithm by Korf & Chickering with the variant proposed by Cohen-Solal, which differs in its backpropagation strategy: instead of stopping when a stable value is encountered, it updates values up to the root. This change slightly improves performance when value ties or transposition tables are involved. Third, we assess replacing the exact terminal evaluation function with the learned heuristic function. While beneficial when exact evaluations are costly, this modification reduces performance in inexpensive settings. Finally, we examine the impact of the completion technique that prioritizes resolved winning states and avoids resolved losing states. This technique also improves performance. Overall, our findings highlight how targeted modifications can enhance the efficiency of Unbounded Best-First Minimax.</p></details> |  |

These models assist programmers in generating code, potentially increasing productivity and efficiency. However, the environmental impact of utilising these AI models is substantial, given their high energy consumption during both training and inference stages. This research aims to compare the energy consumption of manual software development versus an LLM-assisted approach, using Codeforces as a simulation platform for software development. The goal is to quantify the environmental impact and propose strategies for minimising the carbon footprint of using LLM in software development. Our results show that the LLM-assisted code generation leads on average to 32.72 higher carbon footprint than the manual one. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between task complexity and the difference in the carbon footprint of the two approaches.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing methods for matrix completion are heuristics that, while highly scalable and often identifying high-quality solutions, do not possess any optimality guarantees. We reexamine matrix completion with an optimality-oriented eye. We reformulate low-rank matrix completion problems as convex problems over the non-convex set of projection matrices and implement a disjunctive branch-and-bound scheme that solves them to certifiable optimality. Further, we derive a novel and often near-exact class of convex relaxations by decomposing a low-rank matrix as a sum of rank-one matrices and incentivizing that two-by-two minors in each rank-one matrix have determinant zero. In numerical experiments, our new convex relaxations decrease the optimality gap by two orders of magnitude compared to existing attempts, and our disjunctive branch-and-bound scheme solves $n \times m$ rank-$r$ matrix completion problems to certifiable optimality or near optimality in hours for $\max \{m, n\} \leq 2500$ and $r \leq 5$. Moreover, this improvement in the training error translates into an average $2\%$--$50\%$ improvement in the test set error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with new numerics showcasing scalability up to n=2500</p></details> |

LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks, we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable evaluation under real-world conditions.

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics.

To facilitate the study, we construct DeVE-QA -- a dataset featuring 78K questions about 26K events on 10.6K long videos. Our benchmarking shows that state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle on DeVE-QA. For improvement, we propose DeVi, a novel training-free MLLM approach that highlights a hierarchical captioning module, a temporal event memory module, and a self-consistency checking module to respectively detect, contextualize and memorize, and ground dense-events in long videos for question answering. Extensive experiments show that DeVi is superior at answering dense-event questions and grounding relevant video moments. Compared with existing MLLMs, it achieves a remarkable increase of 4.8% and 2.1% for G(round)QA accuracy on DeVE-QA~and NExT-GQA, respectively.

While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features. To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating. First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise. Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions. Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.

| **[Towards Effectively Leveraging Execution Traces for Program Repair with Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04441v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising performance on various programming tasks, including Automatic Program Repair (APR). However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Checkification: A Practical Approach for Testing Static Analysis Truths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12093v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis is an essential component of many modern software development tools. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing complexity of static analyzers makes their coding error-prone. Even analysis tools based on rigorous mathematical techniques, such as abstract interpretation, are not immune to bugs. Ensuring the correctness and reliability of software analyzers is critical if they are to be inserted in production compilers and development environments. While compiler validation has seen notable success, formal validation of static analysis tools remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a method for testing abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Broadly, it consists in checking, over a suite of benchmarks, that the properties inferred statically are satisfied dynamically. The main advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity, which stems directly from framing it within the Ciao assertion-based validation framework, and its blended static/dynamic assertion checking approach. We demonstrate that in this setting, the analysis can be tested with little effort by combining the following components already present in the framework: 1) the static analyzer, which outputs its results as the original program source with assertions interspersed; 2) the assertion run-time checking mechanism, which instruments a program to ensure that no assertion is violated at run time; 3) the random test case generator, which generates random test cases satisfying the properties present in assertion preconditions; and 4) the unit-test framework, which executes those test cases. We have applied our approach to the CiaoPP static analyzer, resulting in the identification of many bugs with reasonable overhead. Most of these bugs have been either fixed or confirmed, helping us detect a range of errors not only related to analysis soundness but also within other aspects of the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

Existing methods often fail to capture local details with global topological integrity from noisy data or construct a balanced dimensionality reduction, resulting in distorted or fractured embeddings. We present an AutoEncoder-based method that integrates a manifold reconstruction layer, which uncovers latent manifold structures from noisy point clouds, and further provides regularizations on topological and geometric properties during dimensionality reduction, whereas the two components promote each other during training. Experiments on point cloud datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines like t-SNE, UMAP, and Topological AutoEncoders in discovering manifold structures from noisy data and preserving them through dimensionality reduction, as validated by visualization and quantitative metrics. This work demonstrates the significance of combining manifold reconstruction with manifold learning to achieve reliable representation of the latent manifold, particularly when dealing with noisy real-world data.

Typically, the performance of LLMs is measured on benchmarks with small or medium-sized context windows of thousands of lines of code. At the same time, in real-world software projects, repositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by contributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The benchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large repositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of functions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies, docstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper presents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at function body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not covered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large repositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC.

However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well.

Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Lens of the Telescope: Online Relevance Estimation over Large Retrieval Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09353v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced relevance models, such as those that use large language models (LLMs), provide highly accurate relevance estimations. However, their computational costs make them infeasible for processing large document corpora. To address this, retrieval systems often employ a telescoping approach, where computationally efficient but less precise lexical and semantic retrievers filter potential candidates for further ranking. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of early-stage retrieval, which can potentially exclude relevant documents early in the process. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for re-ranking called online relevance estimation that continuously updates relevance estimates for a query throughout the ranking process. Instead of re-ranking a fixed set of top-k documents in a single step, online relevance estimation iteratively re-scores smaller subsets of the most promising documents while adjusting relevance scores for the remaining pool based on the estimations from the final model using an online bandit-based algorithm. This dynamic process mitigates the recall limitations of telescoping systems by re-prioritizing documents initially deemed less relevant by earlier stages -- including those completely excluded by earlier-stage retrievers. We validate our approach on TREC benchmarks under two scenarios: hybrid retrieval and adaptive retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is sample-efficient and significantly improves recall, highlighting the effectiveness of our online relevance estimation framework for modern search systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at SIGIR'25 . 11 pages,5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Map entity representation learning (MapRL) generates versatile and reusable data representations, providing essential tools for efficiently managing and utilizing map entity data. Despite the progress in MapRL, two key challenges constrain further development. First, existing research is fragmented, with models classified by the type of map entity, limiting the reusability of techniques across different tasks. Second, the lack of unified benchmarks makes systematic evaluation and comparison of models difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a novel taxonomy for MapRL that organizes models based on functional module-such as encoders, pre-training tasks, and downstream tasks-rather than by entity type. Building on this taxonomy, we present a taxonomy-driven library, VecCity, which offers easy-to-use interfaces for encoding, pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The library integrates datasets from nine cities and reproduces 21 mainstream MapRL models, establishing the first standardized benchmarks for the field. VecCity also allows users to modify and extend models through modular components, facilitating seamless experimentation. Our comprehensive experiments cover multiple types of map entities and evaluate 21 VecCity pre-built models across various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VecCity in streamlining model development and provide insights into the impact of various components on performance. By promoting modular design and reusability, VecCity offers a unified framework to advance research and innovation in MapRL.

These models are essential to Knowledge Graph Completion yet criticized for their opaque, black-box nature. Despite their significant success in capturing the semantics of knowledge graphs through high-dimensional latent representations, their inherent complexity poses substantial challenges to explainability. While existing methods like Kelpie use resource-intensive perturbation to explain KGE models, our approach directly decodes the latent representations encoded by KGE models, leveraging the smoothness of the embeddings, which follows the principle that similar embeddings reflect similar behaviours within the Knowledge Graph, meaning that nodes are similarly embedded because their graph neighbourhood looks similar. This principle is commonly referred to as smoothness. By identifying symbolic structures, in the form of triples, within the subgraph neighborhoods of similarly embedded entities, our method identifies the statistical regularities on which the models rely and translates these insights into human-understandable symbolic rules and facts. This bridges the gap between the abstract representations of KGE models and their predictive outputs, offering clear, interpretable insights. Key contributions include a novel post-hoc and local explainable AI method for KGE models that provides immediate, faithful explanations without retraining, facilitating real-time application on large-scale knowledge graphs. The method's flexibility enables the generation of rule-based, instance-based, and analogy-based explanations, meeting diverse user needs. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of our approach in delivering faithful and well-localized explanations, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of KGE models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Defect Taxonomy for Infrastructure as Code: A Replication Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01568v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: As Infrastructure as Code (IaC) becomes standard practice, ensuring the reliability of IaC scripts is essential. Defect taxonomies are valuable tools for this, offering a common language for issues and enabling systematic tracking. A significant prior study developed such a taxonomy, but based it exclusively on the declarative language Puppet. It remained unknown whether this taxonomy applies to programming language-based IaC (PL-IaC) tools like Pulumi, Terraform CDK, and AWS CDK. Aim: We replicated this foundational work to assess the generalizability of the taxonomy across a broader and more diverse landscape. Method: We performed qualitative analysis on 3,364 defect-related commits from 285 open-source PL-IaC repositories (PIPr dataset) to derive a PL-IaC-specific defect taxonomy. We then enhanced the ACID tool, originally developed for the prior study, to automatically classify and analyze defect distributions across an expanded dataset-447 open-source repositories and 94 proprietary projects from VTEX (e-commerce) and Nubank (financial). Results: Our research confirmed the same eight defect categories identified in the original study, with idempotency and security defects appearing infrequently but persistently across projects. Configuration Data defects maintain high frequency in both open-source and proprietary codebases. Conclusions: Our replication supports the generalizability of the original taxonomy, suggesting IaC development challenges surpass organizational boundaries. Configuration Data defects emerge as a persistent high-frequency problem, while idempotency and security defects remain important concerns despite lower frequency. These patterns appear consistent across open-source and proprietary projects, indicating they are fundamental to the IaC paradigm itself, transcending specific tools or project types.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[How the Misuse of a Dataset Harmed Semantic Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04311v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BigCloneBench is a well-known and widely used large-scale dataset for the evaluation of recall of clone detection tools. It has been beneficial for research on clone detection and has become a standard in evaluating the performance of clone detection tools. More recently, it has also been widely used as a dataset to evaluate machine learning approaches to semantic clone detection or code similarity detection for functional or semantic similarity. This paper demonstrates that BigCloneBench is problematic to use as ground truth for learning or evaluating semantic code similarity, and highlights the aspects of BigCloneBench that affect the ground truth quality. A manual investigation of a statistically significant random sample of 406 Weak Type-3/Type-4 clone pairs revealed that 93% of them do not have a similar functionality and are therefore mislabelled. In a literature review of 179 papers that use BigCloneBench as a dataset, we found 139 papers that used BigCloneBench to evaluate semantic clone detection and where the results are threatened in their validity by the mislabelling. As such, these papers often report high F1 scores (e.g., above 0.9), which indicates overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts rather than genuine semantic similarity detection. We emphasise that using BigCloneBench remains valid for the intended purpose of evaluating syntactic or textual clone detection of Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3 clones. We acknowledge the important contributions of BigCloneBench to two decades of traditional clone detection research. However, the usage of BigCloneBench beyond the intended purpose without careful consideration of its limitations has led to misleading results and conclusions, and potentially harmed the field of semantic clone detection.</p></details> |  |

This article explores the evolution of website information security, examining its historical development, current practices, and future directions. The early beginnings from the 1960s to the 1980s laid the groundwork for modern cybersecurity, with the development of ARPANET, TCP/IP, public-key cryptography, and the first antivirus programs. The 1990s marked a transformative era, driven by the commercialization of the Internet and the emergence of web-based services. As the Internet grew, so did the range and sophistication of cyber threats, leading to advancements in security technologies such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, password protection, and firewalls. Current practices in website information security involve a multi-layered approach, including encryption, secure coding practices, regular security audits, and user education. The future of website information security is expected to be shaped by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing, as well as the increasing importance of international cooperation and standardization efforts. As cyber threats continue to evolve, ongoing research and innovation in website information security will be essential to protect sensitive information and maintain trust in the digital world.</p></details> | 22 pages |

We hypothesized that the benefits of pathway integration does not arise from its biological relevance, but rather from the sparsity it introduces. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of all relevant pathway-based neural network models for predictive tasks, critically evaluating each study's contributions. From this review, we curated a subset of methods for which the source code was publicly available. The comparison of the biologically informed state-of-the-art deep learning models and their randomized counterparts showed that models based on randomized information performed equally well as biologically informed ones across different metrics and datasets. Notably, in 3 out of the 15 analyzed models, the randomized versions even outperformed their biologically informed counterparts. Moreover, pathway-informed models did not show any clear advantage in interpretability, as randomized models were still able to identify relevant disease biomarkers despite lacking explicit pathway information. Our findings suggest that pathway annotations may be too noisy or inadequately explored by current methods. Therefore, we propose a methodology that can be applied to different domains and can serve as a robust benchmark for systematically comparing novel pathway-informed models against their randomized counterparts. This approach enables researchers to rigorously determine whether observed performance improvements can be attributed to biological insights.</p></details> |  |

This index combines the contextual nuances of objective testing with metric stability, providing a legally consistent and reliable measure. Utilizing the Objective Fairness Index, we provide fresh insights into sensitive machine learning applications, such as COMPAS (recidivism prediction), highlighting the metric's practical and theoretical significance.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComPO: Preference Alignment via Comparison Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05465v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Multi-objective optimisation via the R2 utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11774v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of multi-objective optimisation is to identify a collection of points which describe the best possible trade-offs between the multiple objectives. In order to solve this vector-valued optimisation problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarisation functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarised problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimisation techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimisation problem into a single-objective optimisation problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem are the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarised optimisation problems. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimisation algorithms. We then analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimisation, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Review 2025. 47 pages.

| **[Conversational Process Model Redesign](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05453v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign. However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL-DAUNCE: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Data Assimilation with Uncertainty-Aware Constrained Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05452v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has become a powerful tool for enhancing data assimilation. While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning (RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework, which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second, RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space. Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially less computational effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiMind: Enhancing Werewolf Agents with Multimodal Reasoning and Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18039v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[EcoAgent: An Efficient Edge-Cloud Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Mobile Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05440v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.</p></details> |  |

Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artifact Sharing for Information Retrieval Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05434v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharing artifacts -- such as trained models, pre-built indexes, and the code to use them -- aids in reproducibility efforts by allowing researchers to validate intermediate steps and improves the sustainability of research by allowing multiple groups to build off one another's prior computational work. Although there are de facto consensuses on how to share research code (through a git repository linked to from publications) and trained models (via HuggingFace Hub), there is no consensus for other types of artifacts, such as built indexes. Given the practical utility of using shared indexes, researchers have resorted to self-hosting these resources or performing ad hoc file transfers upon request, ultimately limiting the artifacts' discoverability and reuse. This demonstration introduces a flexible and interoperable way to share artifacts for Information Retrieval research, improving both their accessibility and usability.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 (demo) |
| **[Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00781v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational quantum computing offers a flexible computational paradigm with applications in diverse areas. However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 boxes, updated to published version</p></details> |

However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LiTransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. LiTransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LiTransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, LiTransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.</p></details> | Update WIP |

In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Uncertainty Comes for Free: Human-in-the-Loop Policies with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01876v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-in-the-loop (HitL) robot deployment has gained significant attention in both academia and industry as a semi-autonomous paradigm that enables human operators to intervene and adjust robot behaviors at deployment time, improving success rates. However, continuous human monitoring and intervention can be highly labor-intensive and impractical when deploying a large number of robots. To address this limitation, we propose a method that allows diffusion policies to actively seek human assistance only when necessary, reducing reliance on constant human oversight. To achieve this, we leverage the generative process of diffusion policies to compute an uncertainty-based metric based on which the autonomous agent can decide to request operator assistance at deployment time, without requiring any operator interaction during training. Additionally, we show that the same method can be used for efficient data collection for fine-tuning diffusion policies in order to improve their autonomous performance. Experimental results from simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our approach enhances policy performance during deployment for a variety of scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 30 figures.

| **[Active learning of neural population dynamics using two-photon holographic optogenetics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02529v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in techniques for monitoring and perturbing neural populations have greatly enhanced our ability to study circuits in the brain. In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, current HDC-based applications often rely on high-precision models and/or encoding matrices to achieve competitive performance, which imposes significant computational and memory demands, especially for ultra-low power devices. While recent efforts use techniques like precision reduction and pruning to increase the efficiency, most require retraining to maintain performance, making them expensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose a novel Post Training Compression algorithm, Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization (DPQ-HD), which aims at compressing the end-to-end HDC system, achieving near floating point performance without the need of retraining. DPQ-HD reduces computational and memory overhead by uniquely combining the above three compression techniques and efficiently adapts to hardware constraints. Additionally, we introduce an energy-efficient inference approach that progressively evaluates similarity scores such as cosine similarity and performs early exit to reduce the computation, accelerating prediction inference while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate that DPQ-HD achieves up to 20-100x reduction in memory for image and graph classification tasks with only a 1-2% drop in accuracy compared to uncompressed workloads. Lastly, we show that DPQ-HD outperforms the existing post-training compression methods and performs better or at par with retraining-based state-of-the-art techniques, requiring significantly less overall optimization time (up to 100x) and faster inference (up to 56x) on a microcontroller</p></details> |  |
| **[An alignment safety case sketch based on debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03989v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If AI systems match or exceed human capabilities on a wide range of tasks, it may become difficult for humans to efficiently judge their actions -- making it hard to use human feedback to steer them towards desirable traits. One proposed solution is to leverage another superhuman system to point out flaws in the system's outputs via a debate. This paper outlines the value of debate for AI safety, as well as the assumptions and further research required to make debate work. It does so by sketching an ``alignment safety case'' -- an argument that an AI system will not autonomously take actions which could lead to egregious harm, despite being able to do so. The sketch focuses on the risk of an AI R\&D agent inside an AI company sabotaging research, for example by producing false results. To prevent this, the agent is trained via debate, subject to exploration guarantees, to teach the system to be honest. Honesty is maintained throughout deployment via online training. The safety case rests on four key claims: (1) the agent has become good at the debate game, (2) good performance in the debate game implies that the system is mostly honest, (3) the system will not become significantly less honest during deployment, and (4) the deployment context is tolerant of some errors. We identify open research problems that, if solved, could render this a compelling argument that an AI system is safe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05410v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.</p></details> |  |

For transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities. Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representing spherical tensors with scalar-based machine-learning models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05404v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors. The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to implement, and accurate in practical settings.</p></details> |  |

However, methods that rely on exhaustive search to find oblique splits face computational challenges. As a result, they have not been widely explored. We introduce a novel algorithm, Classification and Regression Tree - Exhaustive Linear Combinations (CART-ELC), for inducing oblique decision trees that performs an exhaustive search on a restricted set of hyperplanes. We then investigate the algorithm's computational complexity and its predictive capabilities. Our results demonstrate that CART-ELC consistently achieves competitive performance on small datasets, often yielding statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy relative to existing decision tree induction algorithms, while frequently producing shallower, simpler, and thus more interpretable trees.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> |

We introduce AskGNN, a novel approach that bridges this gap by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate graph data and task-specific information into LLMs. AskGNN employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered structure-enhanced retriever to select labeled nodes across graphs, incorporating complex graph structures and their supervision signals. Our learning-to-retrieve algorithm optimizes the retriever to select example nodes that maximize LLM performance on graph. Experiments across three tasks and seven LLMs demonstrate AskGNN's superior effectiveness in graph task performance, opening new avenues for applying LLMs to graph-structured data without extensive fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

These methods face two challenges: (1) the retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed independently for each event without considering their possible relationship. In this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet effective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we propose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively leverage possible connections between different events and thus capture relevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further analysis shows the impact of different components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper in COLING 2025</p></details> |

| **[On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10729v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference.

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |

To approach this problem, we present DIFF-FLOOD, a probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting method designed based on denoising diffusion models. DIFF-FLOOD predicts inundation level at a location by taking both spatial and temporal context into account. It utilizes inundation levels at neighboring locations and digital elevation data as spatial context. Inundation history from a context time window, together with additional co-variates are used as temporal context. Convolutional neural networks and cross-attention mechanism are then employed to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested DIFF-FLOOD on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a region highly impacted by coastal flooding. Our results show that, DIFF-FLOOD outperforms existing forecasting methods in terms of prediction performance (6% to 64% improvement in terms of two performance metrics) and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Threshold Modulation for Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05375v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025. \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update 08.05.2025: Added some intermediate steps in the derivation of the loss to add clarity.

| **[Enhancing Differential Testing With LLMs For Testing Deep Learning Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07944v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries. We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by ACM TOSEM.

Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf</p></details> |  |

Despite the partial observability, the goal is still to achieve small regret at the level of individual examples. We give results on the sample complexity of LLP under square loss, showing that our sample complexity is essentially optimal. From an algorithmic viewpoint, we rely on carefully designed variants of Empirical Risk Minimization, and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms, combined with ad hoc variance reduction techniques. On one hand, our theoretical results improve in important ways on the existing literature on LLP, specifically in the way the sample complexity depends on the bag size. On the other hand, we validate our algorithmic solutions on several datasets, demonstrating improved empirical performance (better accuracy for less samples) against recent baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to \SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of \SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming, potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences</p></details> |

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards the Worst-case Robustness of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19040v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial attacks, where adversaries craft specific input sequences to induce harmful, violent, private, or incorrect outputs. In this work, we study their worst-case robustness, i.e., whether an adversarial example exists that leads to such undesirable outputs. We upper bound the worst-case robustness using stronger white-box attacks, indicating that most current deterministic defenses achieve nearly 0\% worst-case robustness. We propose a general tight lower bound for randomized smoothing using fractional knapsack solvers or 0-1 knapsack solvers, and using them to bound the worst-case robustness of all stochastic defenses. Based on these solvers, we provide theoretical lower bounds for several previous empirical defenses. For example, we certify the robustness of a specific case, smoothing using a uniform kernel, against \textit{any possible attack} with an average $\ell_0$ perturbation of 2.02 or an average suffix length of 6.41.</p></details> |  |

The absence of comprehensive best practices for feature toggle usage often results in improper implementation, causing code quality issues.

In this study, we present a comprehensive deep learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index (MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively. We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, outperforming existing RGB-based benchmarks. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining multi-resolution imagery, feature augmentation, and optimized training strategies for robust building segmentation in remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>in pr...</summary><p>in preparation for journal submission, 25 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

| **[Scalable Chain of Thoughts via Elastic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05315v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation on SPD Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05745v6)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in geometric deep learning has drawn increasing attention from the machine learning community toward domain adaptation on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds, especially for neuroimaging data that often suffer from distribution shifts across sessions. These data, typically represented as covariance matrices of brain signals, inherently lie on SPD manifolds due to their symmetry and positive definiteness. However, conventional domain adaptation methods often overlook this geometric structure when applied directly to covariance matrices, which can result in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce a new geometric deep learning framework that combines optimal transport theory with the geometry of SPD manifolds. Our approach aligns data distributions while respecting the manifold structure, effectively reducing both marginal and conditional discrepancies. We validate our method on three cross-session brain computer interface datasets, KU, BNCI2014001, and BNCI2015001, where it consistently outperforms baseline approaches while maintaining the intrinsic geometry of the data. We also provide quantitative results and visualizations to better illustrate the behavior of the learned embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Operator-Level Quantum Acceleration of Non-Logconcave Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05301v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from probability distributions of the form $\sigma \propto e^{-\beta V}$, where $V$ is a continuous potential, is a fundamental task across physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, and statistics. However, when $V$ is non-convex, the resulting distribution becomes non-logconcave, and classical methods such as Langevin dynamics often exhibit poor performance. We introduce the first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value thresholding and yields the first provable quantum advantage with respect to the Poincar\'e constant in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this framework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates replica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from complex, rugged energy landscapes.</p></details> | 43 pages, 7 figures |
| **[GeoUni: A Unified Model for Generating Geometry Diagrams, Problems and Problem Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10146v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GeoUni, the first unified geometry expert model capable of generating problem solutions and diagrams within a single framework in a way that enables the creation of unique and individualized geometry problems. Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.</p></details> |  |

Deciphering their intricate, hierarchical structures, and diverse functions is essential for advancing our understanding of life at the molecular level. Protein Representation Learning (PRL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling the extraction of meaningful computational representations from protein data to address these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of PRL research, categorizing methodologies into five key areas: feature-based, sequence-based, structure-based, multimodal, and complex-based approaches. To support researchers in this rapidly evolving field, we introduce widely used databases for protein sequences, structures, and functions, which serve as essential resources for model development and evaluation. We also explore the diverse applications of these approaches in multiple domains, demonstrating their broad impact. Finally, we discuss pressing technical challenges and outline future directions to advance PRL, offering insights to inspire continued innovation in this foundational field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Estimation in Binary Classification Using Calibrated Confidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05295v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model monitoring is a critical component of the machine learning lifecycle, safeguarding against undetected drops in the model's performance after deployment. Traditionally, performance monitoring has required access to ground truth labels, which are not always readily available. This can result in unacceptable latency or render performance monitoring altogether impossible. Recently, methods designed to estimate the accuracy of classifier models without access to labels have shown promising results. However, there are various other metrics that might be more suitable for assessing model performance in many cases. Until now, none of these important metrics has received similar interest from the scientific community. In this work, we address this gap by presenting CBPE, a novel method that can estimate any binary classification metric defined using the confusion matrix. In particular, we choose four metrics from this large family: accuracy, precision, recall, and F$_1$, to demonstrate our method. CBPE treats the elements of the confusion matrix as random variables and leverages calibrated confidence scores of the model to estimate their distributions. The desired metric is then also treated as a random variable, whose full probability distribution can be derived from the estimated confusion matrix. CBPE is shown to produce estimates that come with strong theoretical guarantees and valid confidence intervals.</p></details> |  |

In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

| **[Morphologically Symmetric Reinforcement Learning for Ambidextrous Bimanual Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05287v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation skills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands. Bimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Software Development Life Cycle Perspective: A Survey of Benchmarks for Code Large Language Models and Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05283v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly. Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5 MTL task-weighting strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Connection Between Learning to Reject and Bhattacharyya Divergences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05273v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to abstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an ideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a hypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal distribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that rejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-T: Table Transformer for Tagging-based Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05271v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences. The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges: overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[A Two-Sample Test of Text Generation Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05269v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in digitized text data requires reliable inferential methods on observed textual patterns. This article proposes a novel two-sample text test for comparing similarity between two groups of documents. The hypothesis is whether the probabilistic mapping generating the textual data is identical across two groups of documents. The proposed test aims to assess text similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set. We showed theoretically that under mild conditions, the test statistic asymptotically follows a normal distribution. A multiple data-splitting strategy is proposed to enhance test power, which combines p-values into a unified decision. Various simulation studies and a real data example demonstrated that the proposed two-sample text test maintains the nominal Type one error rate while offering greater power compared to existing methods. The proposed method provides a novel solution to assert differences in document classes, particularly in fields where large-scale textual information is crucial.</p></details> |  |

To equip resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system. ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design, encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed aerial navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, RSS 2025 Demo track, https://theairlab.org/visafe/</p></details> |

This paper addresses key concerns in this domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents' exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Poster) at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rejection via Learning Density Ratios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18686v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification with rejection emerges as a learning paradigm which allows models to abstain from making predictions. The predominant approach is to alter the supervised learning pipeline by augmenting typical loss functions, letting model rejection incur a lower loss than an incorrect prediction. Instead, we propose a different distributional perspective, where we seek to find an idealized data distribution which maximizes a pretrained model's performance. This can be formalized via the optimization of a loss's risk with a $\varphi$-divergence regularization term. Through this idealized distribution, a rejection decision can be made by utilizing the density ratio between this distribution and the data distribution. We focus on the setting where our $\varphi$-divergences are specified by the family of $\alpha$-divergence. Our framework is tested empirically over clean and noisy datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compa...</summary><p>Compared to published version, a typo in Appendix Section E has been fixed</p></details> |

Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on latent variables for generation. For experimental design or creative applications that require more control over the generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g. interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Linear combinations of Latent variables (LOL) as a general-purpose method to form linear combinations of latent variables that adhere to the assumptions of the generative model. As LOL is easy to implement and naturally addresses the broader task of forming any linear combinations, e.g. the construction of subspaces of the latent space, LOL dramatically simplifies the creation of expressive low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

However, its success largely depends on large-scale, high-quality labeled datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain due to the need for expert annotation. To mitigate this limitation, label-efficient deep learning methods have emerged to improve model performance under limited supervision by leveraging labeled, unlabeled, and weakly labeled data. In this survey, we systematically review over 350 peer-reviewed studies and present a comprehensive taxonomy of label-efficient learning methods in MIA. These methods are categorized into four labeling paradigms: no label, insufficient label, inexact label, and label refinement. For each category, we analyze representative techniques across imaging modalities and clinical applications, highlighting shared methodological principles and task-specific adaptations. We also examine the growing role of health foundation models (HFMs) in enabling label-efficient learning through large-scale pre-training and transfer learning, enhancing the use of limited annotations in downstream tasks. Finally, we identify current challenges and future directions to facilitate the translation of label-efficient learning from research promise to everyday clinical care.</p></details> | Under Review |

To that aim, we generated a database with 996 entries, which includes up to 7 variables regarding both the manufacturing process and environmental conditions for more than 180 days. Then, we relied on a software framework that brings together a conglomeration of automated ML protocols that execute sequentially against our database by simply command-line interface. This easily permits hyper-optimizing and randomizing seeds of the ML models through exhaustive benchmarking so that optimal models are obtained. The accuracy achieved reaches values of the coefficient determination (R2) widely exceeding 0.90, whereas the root mean squared error (RMSE), sum of squared error (SSE), and mean absolute error (MAE)>1% of the target value, the PCE. Additionally, we contribute with validated models able to screen the behavior of OSCs never seen in the database. In that case, R2~0.96-0.97 and RMSE~1%, thus confirming the reliability of the proposal to predict. For comparative purposes, classical Bayesian regression fitting based on non-linear mean squares (LMS) are also presented, which only perform sufficiently for univariate cases of single OSCs. Hence they fail to outperform the breadth of the capabilities shown by the ML models. Finally, thanks to the standardized results offered by the ML framework, we study the dependencies between the variables of the dataset and their implications for the optimal performance and stability of the OSCs. Reproducibility is ensured by a standardized report altogether with the dataset, which are publicly available at Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Symbolic World Models via Test-time Scaling of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04728v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving complex planning problems requires Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly model the state transition to avoid rule violations, comply with constraints, and ensure optimality-a task hindered by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50\% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR2025 (32 pages, 6 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Treatment Effect Estimation via Active Learning: A Counterfactual Covering Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05242v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although numerous complex algorithms for treatment effect estimation have been developed in recent years, their effectiveness remains limited when handling insufficiently labeled training sets due to the high cost of labeling the effect after treatment, e.g., expensive tumor imaging or biopsy procedures needed to evaluate treatment effects. Therefore, it becomes essential to actively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a constrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect estimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis within the active learning context, where the derived key measures -- \textit{factual} and \textit{counterfactual covering radius} determine the risk upper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction algorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To generalize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which transforms the optimization objective into the \textit{Factual} and \textit{Counterfactual Coverage Maximization} to ensure effective radius reduction during data acquisition. Furthermore, benchmarking FCCM against other baselines demonstrates its superiority across both fully synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML'25 |
| **[Jailbreaking and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15236v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by advancing natural language understanding and generation, enabling applications across fields beyond healthcare, software engineering, and conversational systems. Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latte: Transfering LLMs` Latent-level Knowledge for Few-shot Tabular Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05237v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot tabular learning, in which machine learning models are trained with a limited amount of labeled data, provides a cost-effective approach to addressing real-world challenges. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer-based assignment decision network for multiple object tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03571v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/psaltaath/tadn-mot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

This binary encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs, providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN. Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach. Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard DNN-Verification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To support advancements in chemistry-focused natural language processing (NLP), we present ChemRxivQuest, a curated dataset of 970 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs derived from 155 ChemRxiv preprints across 17 subfields of chemistry. Each QA pair is explicitly linked to its source text segment to ensure traceability and contextual accuracy. ChemRxivQuest was constructed using an automated pipeline that combines optical character recognition (OCR), GPT-4o-based QA generation, and a fuzzy matching technique for answer verification. The dataset emphasizes conceptual, mechanistic, applied, and experimental questions, enabling applications in retrieval-based QA systems, search engine development, and fine-tuning of domain-adapted large language models. We analyze the dataset's structure, coverage, and limitations, and outline future directions for expansion and expert validation. ChemRxivQuest provides a foundational resource for chemistry NLP research, education, and tool development.</p></details> |  |

However, this complexity poses computational challenges, requiring a balance between model performance and acceptable response times for online services. Traditional methods often utilize filtering techniques. These techniques can lead to the loss of significant information by prioritizing top K items based on item attributes or employing low-precision attention mechanisms. In this study, we introduce LREA, a novel attention mechanism that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches while ensuring computational efficiency. LREA leverages low-rank matrix decomposition to optimize runtime performance and incorporates a specially designed loss function to maintain attention capabilities while preserving information integrity. During the inference phase, matrix absorption and pre-storage strategies are employed to effectively meet runtime constraints. The results of extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by SIGIR 2025 Short Paper Track</p></details> |

However, recently several works raise the security issues of 3D deep models. Although most of them consider adversarial attacks, we identify that backdoor attack is indeed a more serious threat to 3D deep learning systems but remains unexplored. We present the backdoor attacks in 3D point cloud with a unified framework that exploits the unique properties of 3D data and networks. In particular, we design two attack approaches on point cloud: the poison-label backdoor attack (PointPBA) and the clean-label backdoor attack (PointCBA). The first one is straightforward and effective in practice, while the latter is more sophisticated assuming there are certain data inspections. The attack algorithms are mainly motivated and developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples suggesting the vulnerability of deep models under spatial transformation; 2) the proposed feature disentanglement technique that manipulates the feature of the data through optimization methods and its potential to embed a new task. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the PointPBA with over 95% success rate across various 3D datasets and models, and the more stealthy PointCBA with around 50% success rate. Our proposed backdoor attack in 3D point cloud is expected to perform as a baseline for improving the robustness of 3D deep models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2021</p></details> |

We propose MaxUCB, a max $k$-armed bandit method to trade off exploring different model classes and conducting hyperparameter optimization. MaxUCB is specifically designed for the light-tailed and bounded reward distributions arising in this setting and, thus, provides an efficient alternative compared to classic max $k$-armed bandit methods assuming heavy-tailed reward distributions. We theoretically and empirically evaluate our method on four standard AutoML benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over prior approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Lifted Model Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20784v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enable efficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects. In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper accepted to the Proceedings of the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-2025)</p></details> |

Yet, unknown or varying symmetries can lead to overconstrained weights and decreased performance. To address this, this paper introduces a probabilistic method to learn the degree of equivariance in SCNNs. We parameterise the degree of equivariance as a likelihood distribution over the transformation group using Fourier coefficients, offering the option to model layer-wise and shared equivariance. These likelihood distributions are regularised to ensure an interpretable degree of equivariance across the network. Advantages include the applicability to many types of equivariant networks through the flexible framework of SCNNs and the ability to learn equivariance with respect to any subgroup of any compact group without requiring additional layers. Our experiments reveal competitive performance on datasets with mixed symmetries, with learnt likelihood distributions that are representative of the underlying degree of equivariance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, published at ICML 2024 as main conference paper</p></details> |

We design suitable resource management techniques that can simultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale appropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such models are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their training reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such, GFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that update the surrogate model and swiftly discover suitable solutions. We provide simulation results showing that our method can allocate radio resources achieving 20% performance gains against benchmarks, while requiring less than half of the number of acquisition rounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Personalized Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05223v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style. Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation, limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.</p></details> |  |

To better communicate privacy policies for smartwatches, we need an in-depth understanding of their concepts and provide better ways to enable developers to integrate them when engineering systems. Up to now, no conceptual model exists covering privacy statements from different smartwatch manufacturers that is reusable for developers. This paper introduces such a conceptual model for privacy policies of smartwatches and shows its use in a model-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data visualization of wearable privacy policies from different smartwatch manufacturers. We have analyzed the privacy policies of various manufacturers and extracted the relevant concepts. Moreover, we have checked the model with lawyers for its correctness, instantiated it with concrete data, and used it in a model-driven software engineering approach to create a platform for data visualization. This reusable privacy policy model can enable developers to easily represent privacy policies in their systems. This provides a foundation for more structured and understandable privacy policies which, in the long run, can increase the data sovereignty of application users.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the lack of large-scale, diverse, and standardized datasets tailored to physics-based simulations. While existing initiatives provide valuable contributions, many are limited in scope-focusing on specific physics domains, relying on fragmented tooling, or adhering to overly simplistic datamodels that restrict generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce PLAID (Physics-Learning AI Datamodel), a flexible and extensible framework for representing and sharing datasets of physics simulations. PLAID defines a unified standard for describing simulation data and is accompanied by a library for creating, reading, and manipulating complex datasets across a wide range of physical use cases (gitlab.com/drti/plaid). We release six carefully crafted datasets under the PLAID standard, covering structural mechanics and computational fluid dynamics, and provide baseline benchmarks using representative learning methods. Benchmarking tools are made available on Hugging Face, enabling direct participation by the community and contribution to ongoing evaluation efforts (huggingface.co/PLAIDcompetitions).</p></details> |  |

Ensuring they operate in a safe and ethically acceptable fashion is thus critical. However, most solutions have been a form of one-size-fits-all "alignment". We are worried that such systems, which overlook enduring moral diversity, will spark resistance, erode trust, and destabilize our institutions. This paper traces the underlying problem to an often-unstated Axiom of Rational Convergence: the idea that under ideal conditions, rational agents will converge in the limit of conversation on a single ethics. Treating that premise as both optional and doubtful, we propose what we call the appropriateness framework: an alternative approach grounded in conflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional economics. The appropriateness framework treats persistent disagreement as the normal case and designs for it by applying four principles: (1) contextual grounding, (2) community customization, (3) continual adaptation, and (4) polycentric governance. We argue here that adopting these design principles is a good way to shift the main alignment metaphor from moral unification to a more productive metaphor of conflict management, and that taking this step is both desirable and urgent.</p></details> | 16 pages |

By modifying only a small fraction of tokens within item descriptions -- for instance, adding emotional keywords or borrowing phrases from semantically related items -- an attacker can significantly promote or demote targeted items. We formalize these attacks under token-edit and semantic-similarity constraints, and we examine their effectiveness in both promotion (long-tail items) and demotion (short-head items) scenarios. Our experiments on MovieLens, using two large language model (LLM) retrieval modules, show that even subtle attacks shift final rankings and item exposures while eluding naive detection. The results underscore the vulnerability of RAG-based pipelines to small-scale metadata rewrites and emphasize the need for robust textual consistency checks and provenance tracking to thwart stealthy provider-side poisoning.</p></details> |  |

This assumption often fails under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization. To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

There may be instances of discordance regarding the perception of fairness, even when the outcomes comply with established fairness metrics. Several questionnaire-based surveys have been conducted to evaluate fairness metrics with human perceptions of fairness. However, these surveys were limited in scope, including only a few hundred participants within a single country. In this study, we conduct an international survey to evaluate public perceptions of various fairness metrics in decision-making scenarios. We collected responses from 1,000 participants in each of China, France, Japan, and the United States, amassing a total of 4,000 participants, to analyze the preferences of fairness metrics. Our survey consists of three distinct scenarios paired with four fairness metrics. This investigation explores the relationship between personal attributes and the choice of fairness metrics, uncovering a significant influence of national context on these preferences.</p></details> |  |

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IEEE TMI</p></details> |

These physical constraints cannot be fully addressed through advancements in control algorithms alone. Drawing inspiration from the winged flying squirrel, this paper proposes a highly maneuverable drone equipped with agility-enhancing foldable wings. By leveraging collaborative control between the conventional propeller system and the foldable wings-coordinated through the Thrust-Wing Coordination Control (TWCC) framework-the controllable acceleration set is expanded, enabling the generation of abrupt vertical forces that are unachievable with traditional wingless drones. The complex aerodynamics of the foldable wings are modeled using a physics-assisted recurrent neural network (paRNN), which calibrates the angle of attack (AOA) to align with the real aerodynamic behavior of the wings. The additional air resistance generated by appropriately deploying these wings significantly improves the tracking performance of the proposed "flying squirrel" drone. The model is trained on real flight data and incorporates flat-plate aerodynamic principles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed flying squirrel drone achieves a 13.1% improvement in tracking performance, as measured by root mean square error (RMSE), compared to a conventional wingless drone.

The agent under consideration is a price taker who has access only to the stock and factor value processes and the instantaneous volatility. We propose an auxiliary problem in which the agent can invoke policy randomization according to a specific class of Gaussian distributions, and prove that the mean of its optimal Gaussian policy solves the original Merton problem. With randomized policies, we are in the realm of continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) recently developed in Wang et al. (2020) and Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2022b, 2023), enabling us to solve the auxiliary problem in a data-driven way without having to estimate the model primitives. Specifically, we establish a policy improvement theorem based on which we design both online and offline actor-critic RL algorithms for learning Merton's strategies. A key insight from this study is that RL in general and policy randomization in particular are useful beyond the purpose for exploration -- they can be employed as a technical tool to solve a problem that cannot be otherwise solved by mere deterministic policies. At last, we carry out both simulation and empirical studies in a stochastic volatility environment to demonstrate the decisive outperformance of the devised RL algorithms in comparison to the conventional model-based, plug-in method.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Long-Term Individual Causal Effect Estimation via Identifiable Latent Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05192v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating long-term causal effects by combining long-term observational and short-term experimental data is a crucial but challenging problem in many real-world scenarios. In existing methods, several ideal assumptions, e.g. latent unconfoundedness assumption or additive equi-confounding bias assumption, are proposed to address the latent confounder problem raised by the observational data. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are typically violated which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the long-term individual causal effects without the aforementioned assumptions. Specifically, we propose to utilize the natural heterogeneity of data, such as data from multiple sources, to identify latent confounders, thereby significantly avoiding reliance on idealized assumptions. Practically, we devise a latent representation learning-based estimator of long-term causal effects. Theoretically, we establish the identifiability of latent confounders, with which we further achieve long-term effect identification. Extensive experimental studies, conducted on multiple synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Attention-Based Model for 5G Radio-based Outdoor Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23810v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio-based localization in dynamic environments, such as urban and vehicular settings, requires systems that efficiently adapt to varying signal conditions and environmental changes. Factors like multipath interference and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations, which also results in reduced execution time and smaller model size. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a single-layer perceptron. This enables seamless transitions between specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing accuracy and computational complexity. We design three low-complex models tailored for distinct scenarios, and a router that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station and compared to more general models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Proxy Prompt: Endowing SAM and SAM 2 with Auto-Interactive-Prompt for Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03501v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to address the unmet demand for automated prompting and enhanced human-model interactions of SAM and SAM2 for the sake of promoting their widespread clinical adoption. Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p></details> |  |

The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Accpeted |

However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively.

| **[PaniCar: Securing the Perception of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems Against Emergency Vehicle Lighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05183v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety of autonomous cars has come under scrutiny in recent years, especially after 16 documented incidents involving Teslas (with autopilot engaged) crashing into parked emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, and firetrucks). While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources often introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image quality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear. In this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object detector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when exposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a significant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect objects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be exploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving assistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3, "manufacturer C", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors (YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle lighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental factors. We also evaluate four SOTA flare removal methods and show that their performance and latency are insufficient for real-time driving constraints. To mitigate this risk, we propose Caracetamol, a robust framework designed to enhance the resilience of object detectors against the effects of activated emergency vehicle lighting. Our evaluation shows that on YOLOv3 and Faster RCNN, Caracetamol improves the models' average confidence of car detection by 0.20, the lower confidence bound by 0.33, and reduces the fluctuation range by 0.33. In addition, Caracetamol is capable of processing frames at a rate of between 30-50 FPS, enabling real-time ADAS car detection.</p></details> |  |

We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[OpenworldAUC: Towards Unified Evaluation and Optimization for Open-world Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05180v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning adapts Vision-Language Models like CLIP to open-world tasks with minimal training costs. In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2). What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics. We release the code at https://github.com/huacong/OpenworldAUC</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICML2025</p></details> |

Domain knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid') and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory: Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role: Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension; LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory, detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy. Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference; Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets; Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.</p></details> |  |
