| **[A Magnified View into Heterogeneous-ISA Thread Migration Performance without State Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24530v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous-ISA processor designs have attracted considerable research interest. However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Edit:...</summary><p>Edit: Removed bogus journal footnote</p></details> |
| **[Early-Stage Prediction of Review Effort in AI-Generated Pull Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00753v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous AI agents transition from code completion tools to full-fledged teammates capable of opening pull requests (PRs) at scale, software maintainers face a new challenge: not just reviewing code, but managing complex interaction loops with non-human contributors. This paradigm shift raises a critical question: can we predict which agent-generated PRs will consume excessive review effort before any human interaction begins? Analyzing 33,707 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across 2,807 repositories, we uncover a striking two-regime behavioral pattern that fundamentally distinguishes autonomous agents from human developers. The first regime, representing 28.3 percent of all PRs, consists of instant merges (less than 1 minute), reflecting success on narrow automation tasks. The second regime involves iterative review cycles where agents frequently stall or abandon refinement (ghosting). We propose a Circuit Breaker triage model that predicts high-review-effort PRs (top 20 percent) at creation time using only static structural features. A LightGBM model achieves AUC 0.957 on a temporal split, while semantic text features (TF-IDF, CodeBERT) provide negligible predictive value. At a 20 percent review budget, the model intercepts 69 percent of total review effort, enabling zero-latency governance. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in AI-assisted code review: review burden is dictated by what agents touch, not what they say, highlighting the need for structural governance mechanisms in human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Characterizing Bugs and Quality Attributes in Quantum Software: A Large-Scale Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24656v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software bugs across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most bug-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with bug densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity bugs cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more bugs and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected bug incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software bugs and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Where It Matters: Where, Why, and How Developers Want AI Support in Daily Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00762v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI is reshaping software work, yet we lack clear guidance on where developers most need support and how to design it responsibly. We report a large-scale, mixed-methods study of N=860 developers examining where, why, and how they seek or limit AI help across SE tasks. Using cognitive appraisal theory, we provide the first empirically validated mapping of developers' task appraisals to AI adoption patterns and Responsible AI (RAI) priorities. Appraisals predict AI openness and use, revealing distinct patterns: strong current use and demand for improvement in core work (e.g., coding, testing); high demand to reduce toil (e.g., documentation, operations); and clear limits for identity- and relationship-centric work (e.g., mentoring). RAI priorities vary by context: reliability and security for systems-facing tasks; transparency, alignment, and steerability to maintain control; and fairness and inclusiveness for human-facing work. Our results offer concrete, contextual guidance for delivering AI where it matters to developers and their work.</p></details> | ICSE-SEIP'26 |

| **[KELP: Robust Online Log Parsing Through Evolutionary Grouping Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00633v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time log analysis is the cornerstone of observability for modern infrastructure. However, existing online parsers are architecturally unsuited for the dynamism of production environments. Built on fundamentally static template models, they are dangerously brittle: minor schema drifts silently break parsing pipelines, leading to lost alerts and operational toil. We propose \textbf{KELP} (\textbf{K}elp \textbf{E}volutionary \textbf{L}og \textbf{P}arser), a high-throughput parser built on a novel data structure: the Evolutionary Grouping Tree. Unlike heuristic approaches that rely on fixed rules, KELP treats template discovery as a continuous online clustering process. As logs arrive, the tree structure evolves, nodes split, merge, and re-evaluate roots based on changing frequency distributions. Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput.

| **[Towards Understanding and Characterizing Vulnerabilities in Intelligent Connected Vehicles through Real-World Exploits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00627v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) are a core component of modern transportation systems, and their security is crucial as it directly relates to user safety. Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions. This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of ICV vulnerabilities, offering actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers. To support future research, we have made our vulnerability dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Edit:...</summary><p>Edit: Removed bogus journal footnote</p></details> |

This paradigm shift raises a critical question: can we predict which agent-generated PRs will consume excessive review effort before any human interaction begins? Analyzing 33,707 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across 2,807 repositories, we uncover a striking two-regime behavioral pattern that fundamentally distinguishes autonomous agents from human developers. The first regime, representing 28.3 percent of all PRs, consists of instant merges (less than 1 minute), reflecting success on narrow automation tasks. The second regime involves iterative review cycles where agents frequently stall or abandon refinement (ghosting). We propose a Circuit Breaker triage model that predicts high-review-effort PRs (top 20 percent) at creation time using only static structural features. A LightGBM model achieves AUC 0.957 on a temporal split, while semantic text features (TF-IDF, CodeBERT) provide negligible predictive value. At a 20 percent review budget, the model intercepts 69 percent of total review effort, enabling zero-latency governance. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in AI-assisted code review: review burden is dictated by what agents touch, not what they say, highlighting the need for structural governance mechanisms in human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software bugs across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most bug-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with bug densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity bugs cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more bugs and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected bug incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software bugs and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.</p></details> |  |

We report a large-scale, mixed-methods study of N=860 developers examining where, why, and how they seek or limit AI help across SE tasks. Using cognitive appraisal theory, we provide the first empirically validated mapping of developers' task appraisals to AI adoption patterns and Responsible AI (RAI) priorities. Appraisals predict AI openness and use, revealing distinct patterns: strong current use and demand for improvement in core work (e.g., coding, testing); high demand to reduce toil (e.g., documentation, operations); and clear limits for identity- and relationship-centric work (e.g., mentoring). RAI priorities vary by context: reliability and security for systems-facing tasks; transparency, alignment, and steerability to maintain control; and fairness and inclusiveness for human-facing work. Our results offer concrete, contextual guidance for delivering AI where it matters to developers and their work.</p></details> | ICSE-SEIP'26 |

However, existing online parsers are architecturally unsuited for the dynamism of production environments. Built on fundamentally static template models, they are dangerously brittle: minor schema drifts silently break parsing pipelines, leading to lost alerts and operational toil. We propose \textbf{KELP} (\textbf{K}elp \textbf{E}volutionary \textbf{L}og \textbf{P}arser), a high-throughput parser built on a novel data structure: the Evolutionary Grouping Tree. Unlike heuristic approaches that rely on fixed rules, KELP treats template discovery as a continuous online clustering process. As logs arrive, the tree structure evolves, nodes split, merge, and re-evaluate roots based on changing frequency distributions. Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput.

Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions. This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of ICV vulnerabilities, offering actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers. To support future research, we have made our vulnerability dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |

For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Edit:...</summary><p>Edit: Removed bogus journal footnote</p></details> |

This paradigm shift raises a critical question: can we predict which agent-generated PRs will consume excessive review effort before any human interaction begins? Analyzing 33,707 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across 2,807 repositories, we uncover a striking two-regime behavioral pattern that fundamentally distinguishes autonomous agents from human developers. The first regime, representing 28.3 percent of all PRs, consists of instant merges (less than 1 minute), reflecting success on narrow automation tasks. The second regime involves iterative review cycles where agents frequently stall or abandon refinement (ghosting). We propose a Circuit Breaker triage model that predicts high-review-effort PRs (top 20 percent) at creation time using only static structural features. A LightGBM model achieves AUC 0.957 on a temporal split, while semantic text features (TF-IDF, CodeBERT) provide negligible predictive value. At a 20 percent review budget, the model intercepts 69 percent of total review effort, enabling zero-latency governance. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in AI-assisted code review: review burden is dictated by what agents touch, not what they say, highlighting the need for structural governance mechanisms in human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software bugs across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most bug-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with bug densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity bugs cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more bugs and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected bug incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software bugs and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.</p></details> |  |

Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput.

Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions. This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of ICV vulnerabilities, offering actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers. To support future research, we have made our vulnerability dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Edit:...</summary><p>Edit: Removed bogus journal footnote</p></details> |

This paradigm shift raises a critical question: can we predict which agent-generated PRs will consume excessive review effort before any human interaction begins? Analyzing 33,707 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across 2,807 repositories, we uncover a striking two-regime behavioral pattern that fundamentally distinguishes autonomous agents from human developers. The first regime, representing 28.3 percent of all PRs, consists of instant merges (less than 1 minute), reflecting success on narrow automation tasks. The second regime involves iterative review cycles where agents frequently stall or abandon refinement (ghosting). We propose a Circuit Breaker triage model that predicts high-review-effort PRs (top 20 percent) at creation time using only static structural features. A LightGBM model achieves AUC 0.957 on a temporal split, while semantic text features (TF-IDF, CodeBERT) provide negligible predictive value. At a 20 percent review budget, the model intercepts 69 percent of total review effort, enabling zero-latency governance. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in AI-assisted code review: review burden is dictated by what agents touch, not what they say, highlighting the need for structural governance mechanisms in human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software bugs across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most bug-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with bug densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity bugs cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more bugs and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected bug incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software bugs and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.</p></details> |  |

We propose \textbf{KELP} (\textbf{K}elp \textbf{E}volutionary \textbf{L}og \textbf{P}arser), a high-throughput parser built on a novel data structure: the Evolutionary Grouping Tree. Unlike heuristic approaches that rely on fixed rules, KELP treats template discovery as a continuous online clustering process. As logs arrive, the tree structure evolves, nodes split, merge, and re-evaluate roots based on changing frequency distributions. Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput.

Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions. This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of ICV vulnerabilities, offering actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers. To support future research, we have made our vulnerability dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Edit:...</summary><p>Edit: Removed bogus journal footnote</p></details> |
| **[Early-Stage Prediction of Review Effort in AI-Generated Pull Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00753v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous AI agents transition from code completion tools to full-fledged teammates capable of opening pull requests (PRs) at scale, software maintainers face a new challenge: not just reviewing code, but managing complex interaction loops with non-human contributors. This paradigm shift raises a critical question: can we predict which agent-generated PRs will consume excessive review effort before any human interaction begins? Analyzing 33,707 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across 2,807 repositories, we uncover a striking two-regime behavioral pattern that fundamentally distinguishes autonomous agents from human developers. The first regime, representing 28.3 percent of all PRs, consists of instant merges (less than 1 minute), reflecting success on narrow automation tasks. The second regime involves iterative review cycles where agents frequently stall or abandon refinement (ghosting). We propose a Circuit Breaker triage model that predicts high-review-effort PRs (top 20 percent) at creation time using only static structural features. A LightGBM model achieves AUC 0.957 on a temporal split, while semantic text features (TF-IDF, CodeBERT) provide negligible predictive value. At a 20 percent review budget, the model intercepts 69 percent of total review effort, enabling zero-latency governance. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in AI-assisted code review: review burden is dictated by what agents touch, not what they say, highlighting the need for structural governance mechanisms in human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Characterizing Bugs and Quality Attributes in Quantum Software: A Large-Scale Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24656v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software bugs across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most bug-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with bug densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity bugs cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more bugs and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected bug incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software bugs and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Where It Matters: Where, Why, and How Developers Want AI Support in Daily Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00762v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI is reshaping software work, yet we lack clear guidance on where developers most need support and how to design it responsibly. We report a large-scale, mixed-methods study of N=860 developers examining where, why, and how they seek or limit AI help across SE tasks. Using cognitive appraisal theory, we provide the first empirically validated mapping of developers' task appraisals to AI adoption patterns and Responsible AI (RAI) priorities. Appraisals predict AI openness and use, revealing distinct patterns: strong current use and demand for improvement in core work (e.g., coding, testing); high demand to reduce toil (e.g., documentation, operations); and clear limits for identity- and relationship-centric work (e.g., mentoring). RAI priorities vary by context: reliability and security for systems-facing tasks; transparency, alignment, and steerability to maintain control; and fairness and inclusiveness for human-facing work. Our results offer concrete, contextual guidance for delivering AI where it matters to developers and their work.</p></details> | ICSE-SEIP'26 |
| **[SEMODS: A Validated Dataset of Open-Source Software Engineering Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00635v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating Artificial Intelligence into Software Engineering (SE) requires having a curated collection of models suited to SE tasks. With millions of models hosted on Hugging Face (HF) and new ones continuously being created, it is infeasible to identify SE models without a dedicated catalogue. To address this gap, we present SEMODS: an SE-focused dataset of 3,427 models extracted from HF, combining automated collection with rigorous validation through manual annotation and large language model assistance. Our dataset links models to SE tasks and activities from the software development lifecycle, offering a standardized representation of their evaluation results, and supporting multiple applications such as data analysis, model discovery, benchmarking, and model adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 3rd ACM international conference on AI Foundation Models and Software Engineering (FORGE 2026)</p></details> |
| **[KELP: Robust Online Log Parsing Through Evolutionary Grouping Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00633v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time log analysis is the cornerstone of observability for modern infrastructure. However, existing online parsers are architecturally unsuited for the dynamism of production environments. Built on fundamentally static template models, they are dangerously brittle: minor schema drifts silently break parsing pipelines, leading to lost alerts and operational toil. We propose \textbf{KELP} (\textbf{K}elp \textbf{E}volutionary \textbf{L}og \textbf{P}arser), a high-throughput parser built on a novel data structure: the Evolutionary Grouping Tree. Unlike heuristic approaches that rely on fixed rules, KELP treats template discovery as a continuous online clustering process. As logs arrive, the tree structure evolves, nodes split, merge, and re-evaluate roots based on changing frequency distributions. Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput. Our code and dataset can be found at codeberg.org/stonebucklabs/kelp</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding and Characterizing Vulnerabilities in Intelligent Connected Vehicles through Real-World Exploits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00627v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) are a core component of modern transportation systems, and their security is crucial as it directly relates to user safety. Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions. This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of ICV vulnerabilities, offering actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers. To support future research, we have made our vulnerability dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |
