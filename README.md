| **[Question Answering for Multi-Release Systems: A Case Study at Ciena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02345v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Companies regularly have to contend with multi-release systems, where several versions of the same software are in operation simultaneously. Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline. (5) The automatically computed accuracy metrics used in our evaluation strongly correlate with expert human assessments, validating the reliability of our methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in SANER 2026</p></details> |

However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 33th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER 2026)</p></details> |
| **[DSL or Code? Evaluating the Quality of LLM-Generated Algebraic Specifications: A Case Study in Optimization at Kinaxis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00469v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-driven engineering (MDE) provides abstraction and analytical rigour, but industrial adoption in many domains has been limited by the cost of developing and maintaining models. Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICSE-SEIP 2026</p></details> |

Central to ABV are automatic assertion miners, which apply different techniques to generate assertions automatically. This paper reviews the most recent, advanced, and widely adopted assertion miners, offering a comparative analysis of their methodologies. The goal is to provide researchers and verification practitioners with insights into the capabilities and limitations of existing miners. By identifying their shortcomings, this work also points toward directions for developing more powerful and advanced assertion miners in the future.</p></details> | 6 pages |

When code coverage of software for embedded systems needs to be measured, conventional approaches quickly meet their limits. A commonly used approach involves instrumenting the source files with added code that collects and dumps coverage information during runtime. This inserted code usually relies on the existence of an operating and a file system to dump the collected data. These features are not available for bare-metal programs that are executed on embedded systems. To overcome this issue, we present NQC2, a plugin for QEMU.NQC2 extracts coverage information from QEMU during runtime and stores them into a file on the host machine. This approach is even compatible with modified QEMU versions and does not require target-software instrumentation. NQC2 outperforms a comparable approach from Xilinx by up to 8.5 x.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the Rapid Simulation and Performance Evaluation for Design Workshop (RAPIDO '24)</p></details> |
| **[From Commits to Confidence: Towards Stability-Informed Risk Assessment in Open Source Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02487v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open source software (OSS) generates trillions of dollars in economic value and has become essential to the technical infrastructures that power organizations worldwide. As these systems increasingly depend on OSS, understanding the evolution of these projects is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience, or the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures,security vulnerabilities and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns may serve as an indicator of underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes, factors that existing research associates with resilience. Our findings reveal that only 2% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while the remaining half are unstable across all levels of granularity. Analysis of the 50 unstable repositories indicate that 86% of activity is concentrated among a few maintainers, with the top 3 contributors accounting for over 50% of commits in the past 5 years. In contrast, the 50 stable repositories distribute work more evenly, with the top 3 contributors representing less than 50% of commits. Our insights thus far indicate the fragile and multi-dimensional nature of OSS project stability, suggesting a need to go beyond commits to understand how our understanding of stability can be enriched with other considerations such as community engagement metrics and issue or pull request churn. Though our efforts only identified two repositories that achieved stability at all three temporal commit granularities, further investigation into their processes and policies can provide insights and foundations for stability-informed risk assessment in practice.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PauliEngine, a high-performance C++ framework that provides efficient primitives for Pauli string multiplication, commutators, symbolic phase tracking, and structural transformations. Built on a binary symplectic representation and optimized bit-wise operations, PauliEngine supports both numerical and symbolic coefficients and is accessible through a Python interface. Runtime benchmarks demonstrate substantial speedups over state-of-the-art implementations. PauliEngine provides a scalable backend for operator-based quantum software tools and simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLIR-Smith: A Novel Random Program Generator for Evaluating Compiler Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02218v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compilers are essential for the performance and correct execution of software and hold universal relevance across various scientific disciplines. Despite this, there is a notable lack of tools for testing and evaluating them, especially within the adaptable Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) context. This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accommodate MLIR's extensibility, a feature not provided by previous methods such as Csmith. Here we introduce MLIR-Smith, a novel random program generator specifically designed to test and evaluate MLIR-based compiler optimizations. We demonstrate the utility of MLIR-Smith by conducting differential testing on MLIR, LLVM, DaCe, and DCIR, which led to the discovery of multiple bugs in these compiler pipelines. The introduction of MLIR-Smith not only fills a void in the realm of compiler testing but also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive testing within these systems. By providing a tool that can generate random MLIR programs, this paper enhances our ability to evaluate and improve compilers and paves the way for future tools, potentially shaping the wider landscape of software testing and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

For code analysis we adopt event chains model which provides formal foundations to systematic validation of functional safety, taking into account the semantic validity of messages exchanged between key components, including both CAN and Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS). Analysis of security aspects for topology relies on synergy with Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach and Object Constraint Language (OCL) rules. Both locally deployable and proprietary solution are taken into account for evaluation within Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)-related scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While industry practice has long optimized code for human comprehension, it is increasingly important to ensure that LLMs with different capabilities can edit code reliably. In this study, we investigate the concept of ``AI-friendly code'' via LLM-based refactoring on a dataset of 5,000 Python files from competitive programming. We find a meaningful association between CodeHealth, a quality metric calibrated for human comprehension, and semantic preservation after AI refactoring. Our findings confirm that human-friendly code is also more compatible with AI tooling. These results suggest that organizations can use CodeHealth to guide where AI interventions are lower risk and where additional human oversight is warranted. Investing in maintainability not only helps humans; it also prepares for large-scale AI adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 3rd ACM International Conference on AI Foundation Models and Software Engineering (FORGE 2026)</p></details> |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language descriptions. However, current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while ignoring deployability, the critical measure of the utility of IaC configuration files. Six state-of-the-art LLMs performed poorly on deployability, achieving only 20.8$\sim$30.2% deployment success rate on the first attempt. In this paper, we construct DPIaC-Eval, the first deployability-centric IaC template benchmark consisting of 153 real-world scenarios cross 58 unique services. Also, we propose an LLM-based deployability-centric framework, dubbed IaCGen, that uses iterative feedback mechanism encompassing format verification, syntax checking, and live deployment stages, thereby closely mirroring the real DevOps workflows. Results show that IaCGen can make 54.6$\sim$91.6% generated IaC templates from all evaluated models deployable in the first 10 iterations. Additionally, human-in-the-loop feedback that provide direct guidance for the deployability errors, can further boost the performance to over 90% passItr@25 on all evaluated LLMs. Furthermore, we explore the trustworthiness of the generated IaC templates on user intent alignment and security compliance. The poor performance (25.2% user requirement coverage and 8.4% security compliance rate) indicates a critical need for continued research in this domain.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2026 |

Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICSE-SEIP 2026</p></details> |

As these systems increasingly depend on OSS, understanding the evolution of these projects is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience, or the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures,security vulnerabilities and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns may serve as an indicator of underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes, factors that existing research associates with resilience. Our findings reveal that only 2% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while the remaining half are unstable across all levels of granularity. Analysis of the 50 unstable repositories indicate that 86% of activity is concentrated among a few maintainers, with the top 3 contributors accounting for over 50% of commits in the past 5 years. In contrast, the 50 stable repositories distribute work more evenly, with the top 3 contributors representing less than 50% of commits. Our insights thus far indicate the fragile and multi-dimensional nature of OSS project stability, suggesting a need to go beyond commits to understand how our understanding of stability can be enriched with other considerations such as community engagement metrics and issue or pull request churn. Though our efforts only identified two repositories that achieved stability at all three temporal commit granularities, further investigation into their processes and policies can provide insights and foundations for stability-informed risk assessment in practice.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accommodate MLIR's extensibility, a feature not provided by previous methods such as Csmith. Here we introduce MLIR-Smith, a novel random program generator specifically designed to test and evaluate MLIR-based compiler optimizations.

The introduction of MLIR-Smith not only fills a void in the realm of compiler testing but also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive testing within these systems.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language descriptions. However, current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while ignoring deployability, the critical measure of the utility of IaC configuration files. Six state-of-the-art LLMs performed poorly on deployability, achieving only 20.8$\sim$30.2% deployment success rate on the first attempt. In this paper, we construct DPIaC-Eval, the first deployability-centric IaC template benchmark consisting of 153 real-world scenarios cross 58 unique services. Also, we propose an LLM-based deployability-centric framework, dubbed IaCGen, that uses iterative feedback mechanism encompassing format verification, syntax checking, and live deployment stages, thereby closely mirroring the real DevOps workflows. Results show that IaCGen can make 54.6$\sim$91.6% generated IaC templates from all evaluated models deployable in the first 10 iterations. Additionally, human-in-the-loop feedback that provide direct guidance for the deployability errors, can further boost the performance to over 90% passItr@25 on all evaluated LLMs. Furthermore, we explore the trustworthiness of the generated IaC templates on user intent alignment and security compliance. The poor performance (25.2% user requirement coverage and 8.4% security compliance rate) indicates a critical need for continued research in this domain.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2026 |

Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline. (5) The automatically computed accuracy metrics used in our evaluation strongly correlate with expert human assessments, validating the reliability of our methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in SANER 2026</p></details> |

This inserted code usually relies on the existence of an operating and a file system to dump the collected data. These features are not available for bare-metal programs that are executed on embedded systems. To overcome this issue, we present NQC2, a plugin for QEMU.NQC2 extracts coverage information from QEMU during runtime and stores them into a file on the host machine. This approach is even compatible with modified QEMU versions and does not require target-software instrumentation. NQC2 outperforms a comparable approach from Xilinx by up to 8.5 x.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the Rapid Simulation and Performance Evaluation for Design Workshop (RAPIDO '24)</p></details> |

As these systems increasingly depend on OSS, understanding the evolution of these projects is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience, or the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures,security vulnerabilities and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns may serve as an indicator of underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes, factors that existing research associates with resilience. Our findings reveal that only 2% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while the remaining half are unstable across all levels of granularity. Analysis of the 50 unstable repositories indicate that 86% of activity is concentrated among a few maintainers, with the top 3 contributors accounting for over 50% of commits in the past 5 years. In contrast, the 50 stable repositories distribute work more evenly, with the top 3 contributors representing less than 50% of commits. Our insights thus far indicate the fragile and multi-dimensional nature of OSS project stability, suggesting a need to go beyond commits to understand how our understanding of stability can be enriched with other considerations such as community engagement metrics and issue or pull request churn. Though our efforts only identified two repositories that achieved stability at all three temporal commit granularities, further investigation into their processes and policies can provide insights and foundations for stability-informed risk assessment in practice.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, there is a notable lack of tools for testing and evaluating them, especially within the adaptable Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) context. This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accommodate MLIR's extensibility, a feature not provided by previous methods such as Csmith. Here we introduce MLIR-Smith, a novel random program generator specifically designed to test and evaluate MLIR-based compiler optimizations. We demonstrate the utility of MLIR-Smith by conducting differential testing on MLIR, LLVM, DaCe, and DCIR, which led to the discovery of multiple bugs in these compiler pipelines. The introduction of MLIR-Smith not only fills a void in the realm of compiler testing but also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive testing within these systems. By providing a tool that can generate random MLIR programs, this paper enhances our ability to evaluate and improve compilers and paves the way for future tools, potentially shaping the wider landscape of software testing and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language descriptions.

Six state-of-the-art LLMs performed poorly on deployability, achieving only 20.8$\sim$30.2% deployment success rate on the first attempt. In this paper, we construct DPIaC-Eval, the first deployability-centric IaC template benchmark consisting of 153 real-world scenarios cross 58 unique services. Also, we propose an LLM-based deployability-centric framework, dubbed IaCGen, that uses iterative feedback mechanism encompassing format verification, syntax checking, and live deployment stages, thereby closely mirroring the real DevOps workflows. Results show that IaCGen can make 54.6$\sim$91.6% generated IaC templates from all evaluated models deployable in the first 10 iterations. Additionally, human-in-the-loop feedback that provide direct guidance for the deployability errors, can further boost the performance to over 90% passItr@25 on all evaluated LLMs. Furthermore, we explore the trustworthiness of the generated IaC templates on user intent alignment and security compliance. The poor performance (25.2% user requirement coverage and 8.4% security compliance rate) indicates a critical need for continued research in this domain.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2026 |

Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline. (5) The automatically computed accuracy metrics used in our evaluation strongly correlate with expert human assessments, validating the reliability of our methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in SANER 2026</p></details> |

However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 33th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER 2026)</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICSE-SEIP 2026</p></details> |

This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accommodate MLIR's extensibility, a feature not provided by previous methods such as Csmith. Here we introduce MLIR-Smith, a novel random program generator specifically designed to test and evaluate MLIR-based compiler optimizations. We demonstrate the utility of MLIR-Smith by conducting differential testing on MLIR, LLVM, DaCe, and DCIR, which led to the discovery of multiple bugs in these compiler pipelines.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language descriptions.

Six state-of-the-art LLMs performed poorly on deployability, achieving only 20.8$\sim$30.2% deployment success rate on the first attempt. In this paper, we construct DPIaC-Eval, the first deployability-centric IaC template benchmark consisting of 153 real-world scenarios cross 58 unique services. Also, we propose an LLM-based deployability-centric framework, dubbed IaCGen, that uses iterative feedback mechanism encompassing format verification, syntax checking, and live deployment stages, thereby closely mirroring the real DevOps workflows. Results show that IaCGen can make 54.6$\sim$91.6% generated IaC templates from all evaluated models deployable in the first 10 iterations. Additionally, human-in-the-loop feedback that provide direct guidance for the deployability errors, can further boost the performance to over 90% passItr@25 on all evaluated LLMs. Furthermore, we explore the trustworthiness of the generated IaC templates on user intent alignment and security compliance.

Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline. (5) The automatically computed accuracy metrics used in our evaluation strongly correlate with expert human assessments, validating the reliability of our methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in SANER 2026</p></details> |

However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 33th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER 2026)</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICSE-SEIP 2026</p></details> |

As these systems increasingly depend on OSS, understanding the evolution of these projects is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience, or the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures,security vulnerabilities and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns may serve as an indicator of underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes, factors that existing research associates with resilience. Our findings reveal that only 2% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while the remaining half are unstable across all levels of granularity. Analysis of the 50 unstable repositories indicate that 86% of activity is concentrated among a few maintainers, with the top 3 contributors accounting for over 50% of commits in the past 5 years. In contrast, the 50 stable repositories distribute work more evenly, with the top 3 contributors representing less than 50% of commits. Our insights thus far indicate the fragile and multi-dimensional nature of OSS project stability, suggesting a need to go beyond commits to understand how our understanding of stability can be enriched with other considerations such as community engagement metrics and issue or pull request churn. Though our efforts only identified two repositories that achieved stability at all three temporal commit granularities, further investigation into their processes and policies can provide insights and foundations for stability-informed risk assessment in practice.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language descriptions. However, current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while ignoring deployability, the critical measure of the utility of IaC configuration files. Six state-of-the-art LLMs performed poorly on deployability, achieving only 20.8$\sim$30.2% deployment success rate on the first attempt. In this paper, we construct DPIaC-Eval, the first deployability-centric IaC template benchmark consisting of 153 real-world scenarios cross 58 unique services. Also, we propose an LLM-based deployability-centric framework, dubbed IaCGen, that uses iterative feedback mechanism encompassing format verification, syntax checking, and live deployment stages, thereby closely mirroring the real DevOps workflows. Results show that IaCGen can make 54.6$\sim$91.6% generated IaC templates from all evaluated models deployable in the first 10 iterations. Additionally, human-in-the-loop feedback that provide direct guidance for the deployability errors, can further boost the performance to over 90% passItr@25 on all evaluated LLMs. Furthermore, we explore the trustworthiness of the generated IaC templates on user intent alignment and security compliance. The poor performance (25.2% user requirement coverage and 8.4% security compliance rate) indicates a critical need for continued research in this domain.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2026 |

Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline. (5) The automatically computed accuracy metrics used in our evaluation strongly correlate with expert human assessments, validating the reliability of our methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in SANER 2026</p></details> |

However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 33th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER 2026)</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICSE-SEIP 2026</p></details> |

As these systems increasingly depend on OSS, understanding the evolution of these projects is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience, or the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures,security vulnerabilities and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns may serve as an indicator of underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes, factors that existing research associates with resilience. Our findings reveal that only 2% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while the remaining half are unstable across all levels of granularity. Analysis of the 50 unstable repositories indicate that 86% of activity is concentrated among a few maintainers, with the top 3 contributors accounting for over 50% of commits in the past 5 years. In contrast, the 50 stable repositories distribute work more evenly, with the top 3 contributors representing less than 50% of commits. Our insights thus far indicate the fragile and multi-dimensional nature of OSS project stability, suggesting a need to go beyond commits to understand how our understanding of stability can be enriched with other considerations such as community engagement metrics and issue or pull request churn. Though our efforts only identified two repositories that achieved stability at all three temporal commit granularities, further investigation into their processes and policies can provide insights and foundations for stability-informed risk assessment in practice.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accommodate MLIR's extensibility, a feature not provided by previous methods such as Csmith. Here we introduce MLIR-Smith, a novel random program generator specifically designed to test and evaluate MLIR-based compiler optimizations. We demonstrate the utility of MLIR-Smith by conducting differential testing on MLIR, LLVM, DaCe, and DCIR, which led to the discovery of multiple bugs in these compiler pipelines. The introduction of MLIR-Smith not only fills a void in the realm of compiler testing but also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive testing within these systems. By providing a tool that can generate random MLIR programs, this paper enhances our ability to evaluate and improve compilers and paves the way for future tools, potentially shaping the wider landscape of software testing and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline. (5) The automatically computed accuracy metrics used in our evaluation strongly correlate with expert human assessments, validating the reliability of our methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in SANER 2026</p></details> |

However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 33th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER 2026)</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICSE-SEIP 2026</p></details> |

When code coverage of software for embedded systems needs to be measured, conventional approaches quickly meet their limits.

This inserted code usually relies on the existence of an operating and a file system to dump the collected data. These features are not available for bare-metal programs that are executed on embedded systems. To overcome this issue, we present NQC2, a plugin for QEMU.NQC2 extracts coverage information from QEMU during runtime and stores them into a file on the host machine.

As these systems increasingly depend on OSS, understanding the evolution of these projects is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience, or the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures,security vulnerabilities and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns may serve as an indicator of underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes, factors that existing research associates with resilience. Our findings reveal that only 2% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while the remaining half are unstable across all levels of granularity. Analysis of the 50 unstable repositories indicate that 86% of activity is concentrated among a few maintainers, with the top 3 contributors accounting for over 50% of commits in the past 5 years. In contrast, the 50 stable repositories distribute work more evenly, with the top 3 contributors representing less than 50% of commits. Our insights thus far indicate the fragile and multi-dimensional nature of OSS project stability, suggesting a need to go beyond commits to understand how our understanding of stability can be enriched with other considerations such as community engagement metrics and issue or pull request churn. Though our efforts only identified two repositories that achieved stability at all three temporal commit granularities, further investigation into their processes and policies can provide insights and foundations for stability-informed risk assessment in practice.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language descriptions. However, current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while ignoring deployability, the critical measure of the utility of IaC configuration files. Six state-of-the-art LLMs performed poorly on deployability, achieving only 20.8$\sim$30.2% deployment success rate on the first attempt. In this paper, we construct DPIaC-Eval, the first deployability-centric IaC template benchmark consisting of 153 real-world scenarios cross 58 unique services. Also, we propose an LLM-based deployability-centric framework, dubbed IaCGen, that uses iterative feedback mechanism encompassing format verification, syntax checking, and live deployment stages, thereby closely mirroring the real DevOps workflows. Results show that IaCGen can make 54.6$\sim$91.6% generated IaC templates from all evaluated models deployable in the first 10 iterations. Additionally, human-in-the-loop feedback that provide direct guidance for the deployability errors, can further boost the performance to over 90% passItr@25 on all evaluated LLMs. Furthermore, we explore the trustworthiness of the generated IaC templates on user intent alignment and security compliance. The poor performance (25.2% user requirement coverage and 8.4% security compliance rate) indicates a critical need for continued research in this domain.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2026 |

Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively.
