| **[EffiReasonTrans: RL-Optimized Reasoning for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18863v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation is a crucial task in software development and maintenance. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model, DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each (source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally, EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into agent-based frameworks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/EffiReasonTrans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlining Acceptance Test Generation for Mobile Applications Through Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18861v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile acceptance testing remains a bottleneck in modern software development, particularly for cross-platform mobile development using frameworks like Flutter. While developers increasingly rely on automated testing tools, creating and maintaining acceptance test artifacts still demands significant manual effort. To help tackle this issue, we introduce AToMIC, an automated framework leveraging specialized Large Language Models to generate Gherkin scenarios, Page Objects, and executable UI test scripts directly from requirements (JIRA tickets) and recent code changes. Applied to BMW's MyBMW app, covering 13 real-world issues in a 170+ screen codebase, AToMIC produced executable test artifacts in under five minutes per feature on standard hardware. The generated artifacts were of high quality: 93.3% of Gherkin scenarios were syntactically correct upon generation, 78.8% of PageObjects ran without manual edits, and 100% of generated UI tests executed successfully. In a survey, all practitioners reported time savings (often a full developer-day per feature) and strong confidence in adopting the approach. These results confirm AToMIC as a scalable, practical solution for streamlining acceptance test creation and maintenance in industrial mobile projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeClustRE: Hierarchical Clustering and Semantic Tagging of App Features from User Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18799v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[Context and motivation.] Extracting features from mobile app reviews is increasingly important for multiple requirements engineering (RE) tasks. However, existing methods struggle to turn noisy, ambiguous feedback into interpretable insights. [Question/problem.] Syntactic approaches lack semantic depth, while large language models (LLMs) often miss fine-grained features or fail to structure them coherently. In addition, existing methods output flat lists of features without semantic organization, limiting interpretation and comparability. Consequently, current feature extraction approaches do not provide structured, meaningful representations of app features. As a result, practitioners face fragmented information that hinder requirement analysis, prioritization, and cross-app comparison, among other use cases. [Principal ideas/results.] In this context, we propose FeClustRE, a framework integrating hybrid feature extraction, hierarchical clustering with auto-tuning and LLM-based semantic labelling. FeClustRE combines syntactic parsing with LLM enrichment, organizes features into clusters, and automatically generates meaningful taxonomy labels. We evaluate FeClustRE on public benchmarks for extraction correctness and on a sample study of generative AI assistant app reviews for clustering quality, semantic coherence, and interpretability. [Contribution.] Overall, FeClustRE delivers (1) a hybrid framework for feature extraction and taxonomy generation, (2) an auto-tuning mechanism with a comprehensive evaluation methodology, and (3) open-source and replicable implementation. These contributions bridge user feedback and feature understanding, enabling deeper insights into current and emerging requirements.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Causally Perturbed Fairness Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18719v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features (e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in engineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key challenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an intractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing on designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about data characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting their full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT. Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most directly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive counterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a causal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide a test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves as a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators. Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation, CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more efficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all cases.</p></details> | accepted by TOSEM |
| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20749v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues. Data and code are available at https://alfin06.github.io/AgentIssue-Bench-Leaderboard/#/ .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CUARewardBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reward Models on Computer-using Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18596v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-using agents (CUAs) enable task completion through natural interaction with operating systems and software interfaces. While script-based verifiers are widely adopted for evaluation, they suffer from limited scalability and inability to provide step-wise assessment. Reward models offer promising alternatives, but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench, comprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward Benchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic assessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse, Practical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10 software categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels (25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through carefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure reliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and Insights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3 prompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including insufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the superiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation. (4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our comprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that significantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting and strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and 93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially outperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |
| **[ReVeal: Self-Evolving Code Agents via Reliable Self-Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11442v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing methods rely solely on outcome rewards, without explicitly optimizing verification or leveraging reliable signals from realistic environments, leading to unreliable self-verification and limited test-time scaling. To address this, we widen the verification-generation asymmetry by explicitly optimizing self-verification, making it a reliable driver of deeper test-time scaling. We introduce ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that evolves code generation through self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal structures long-horizon reasoning as iterative generation-verification turns and incorporates TAPO for turn-level credit assignment, fostering the co-evolution of code and test generation. At inference, this strengthened self-verification enables the model to use self-constructed tests and tool feedback to continuously evolve code for 20+ turns on LiveCodeBench despite training on only three. It also significantly improves Pass@k, indicating stronger exploration that expands the reasoning boundaries of the base model. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable paradigm for RL training and test-time scaling, paving the way for more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Structured Evaluation Framework for Low-Code Platform Selection: A Multi-Criteria Decision Model for Enterprise Digital Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18590v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDPs) has created a critical need for systematic evaluation methodologies that enable organizations to make informed platform selection decisions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework based on five key criteria: Business Process Orchestration, UI/UX Customization, Integration and Interoperability, Governance and Security, and AI-Enhanced Automation. We propose a weighted scoring model that allows organizations to quantitatively assess and compare different low-code platforms based on their specific requirements and strategic priorities. The framework addresses the gap between marketing-driven platform comparisons and rigorous, context-specific evaluation methodologies. Through empirical validation in enterprise environments, we demonstrate how this structured approach can significantly improve decision-making outcomes and reduce the risk of platform lock-in or inadequate solution selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figure.

| **[WebDevJudge: Evaluating (M)LLMs as Critiques for Web Development Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18560v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paradigm of LLM-as-a-judge is emerging as a scalable and efficient alternative to human evaluation, demonstrating strong performance on well-defined tasks. However, its reliability in open-ended tasks with dynamic environments and complex interactions remains unexplored. To bridge the gap, we introduce WebDevJudge, a systematic benchmark for assessing LLM-as-a-judge performance in web development, with support for both non-interactive evaluation based on static observations and continuous interactive evaluation with a dynamic web environment. WebDevJudge comprises human preference labels over paired web implementations, annotated with structured and query-grounded rubrics to ensure high-quality ground truth. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate various evaluators, including LLMs, MLLMs, and agentic workflows. We systematically investigate the impact of different paradigms and guidance mechanisms. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between LLM judges and human experts. In-depth analysis indicates this gap stems from fundamental model limitations, including failures in recognizing functional equivalence, verifying task feasibility, and mitigating bias. Overall, WebDevJudge presents a significant challenge to LLM-as-a-judge, offering insights to guide future research toward developing more reliable and capable automated evaluators for complicated scenarios.

| **[PEACE: Towards Efficient Project-Level Efficiency Optimization via Hybrid Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17142v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capability in code generation, but their potential in code efficiency optimization remains underexplored. Previous LLM-based code efficiency optimization approaches exclusively focus on function-level optimization and overlook interaction between functions, failing to generalize to real-world development scenarios. Code editing techniques show great potential for conducting project-level optimization, yet they face challenges associated with invalid edits and suboptimal internal functions. To address these gaps, we propose Peace, a novel hybrid framework for Project-level code Efficiency optimization through Automatic Code Editing, which also ensures the overall correctness and integrity of the project. Peace integrates three key phases: dependency-aware optimizing function sequence construction, valid associated edits identification, and efficiency optimization editing iteration. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of Peace, we construct PeacExec, the first benchmark comprising 146 real-world optimization tasks from 47 high-impact GitHub Python projects, along with highly qualified test cases and executable environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate Peace's superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 69.2% correctness rate (pass@1), +46.9% opt rate, and 0.840 speedup in execution efficiency. Notably, our Peace outperforms all baselines by significant margins, particularly in complex optimization tasks with multiple functions. Moreover, extensive experiments are also conducted to validate the contributions of each component in Peace, as well as the rationale and effectiveness of our hybrid framework design.</p></details> |  |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |
| **[InspectCoder: Dynamic Analysis-Enabled Self Repair through interactive LLM-Debugger Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18327v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhyFlow: Interrogative Debugger for Sensemaking Taint Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |

Yet few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, potentially due to the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench has 111 curated and reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific out-of-order execution issue. To support reproducibility and ease of use, JunoBench offers a unified execution environment where crashes and fixes can be reliably reproduced. By providing realistic crashes and their resolutions, JunoBench facilitates bug detection, localization, and repair tailored to the interactive and iterative nature of notebook-based ML development.</p></details> |  |

| **[TREAT: A Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation and Testing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17163v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models are fundamentally transforming the software engineering landscape, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks such as code generation, debugging, and testing. Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Final Code: A Process-Oriented Error Analysis of Software Development Agents in Real-World GitHub Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICSE 2026, Research Track</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Study of Time Limit Exceeded Errors in Online Programming Assignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14339v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online programming platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode attract millions of users seeking to learn to program or refine their skills for industry interviews. A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon their submissions after repeated TLE failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely performance issues. Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same 1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.</p></details> |  |

Automated repair of such failures is promising, but existing techniques rely on test cases, which are not available for non-compilable code. We employ an automated repair approach for compilation errors driven by large language models (LLMs). Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000 commits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours typically required for manual debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference: 2025 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)</p></details> |
| **[Can ChatGPT support software verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |
| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69 AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95% CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90% relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1 inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus 28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%) occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points; arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven, provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis with end-to-end auditability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, link to code repo</p></details> |
| **[On Developers' Self-Declaration of AI-Generated Code: An Analysis of Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16485v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers, who use them to assist in software development due to their capability to generate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

However, the reality of video games require its own set of unique debugging techniques such as On-Screen Console, Debug Draws, Debug Camera, Cheats and In-Game Menus, and Data Scrubbing. In this article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, gas 2026 conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |

We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[HotBugs.jar: A Benchmark of Hot Fixes for Time-Critical Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07529v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework, HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting in Practice: Investigating Software Developers' Use of Generative AI Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06000v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has fundamentally transformed software development. Although prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill, existing research focuses primarily on individual techniques rather than software developers' broader workflows. This study presents a systematic investigation of how software engineers integrate GenAI tools into their professional practice through a large-scale survey examining prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across various software engineering tasks. We surveyed 91 software engineers, including 72 active GenAI users, to understand AI usage patterns throughout the development process. Our 14 key findings show that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency strongly correlates with using AI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and code review, and that developers prefer iterative multi-turn conversations to single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable, while complex code generation and debugging present sizable challenges. Our insights provide an empirical baseline of current developer practices, from simple code generation to deeper workflow integration, with actionable insights for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |

While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.</p></details> |  |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging approach should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with the tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |

Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap, this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity. Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes. Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts. Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences, necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |

Vibe coding is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code. Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101 practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools' outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers, particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping, but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.</p></details> |  |

We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJjFfnxUx0.</p></details> |  |
| **[TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.</p></details> |  |

Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures.

| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence-Guided Concolic Testing of Transformer Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23806v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an {influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible, pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring, compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that (i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration, and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering potential utility for debugging and model auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Specific Instruction: A Longitudinal Study on Debugging Skill Acquisition and Retention for Novice Programmers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22420v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localization is a critical skill, yet novices often lack systematic approaches. Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps; the impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week longitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract guidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that pairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4). Forty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5). Each session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element containing a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to completion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and strategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to completion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other groups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p < 0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other groups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses showed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants internalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that context-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger retention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions produced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized performance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may bridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more equitable path for novices.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (25 pages for the paper, rest pages are references and appendix). 4 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[SecureAgentBench: Benchmarking Secure Code Generation under Realistic Vulnerability Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22097v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents (SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions, (ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step toward more reliable software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Python Programming Education with an AI-Powered Code Helper: Design, Implementation, and Impact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20518v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Co-evolutionary Metamorphic Differential Testing for Autonomous Systems with an Interpretability Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16478v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, such as autonomous driving systems, evolve rapidly through frequent updates, risking unintended behavioral degradations. Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment. CoCoMagic offers an efficient, effective, and interpretable way for the differential testing of evolving autonomous systems across versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous systems, giving rise to a new class of software known as Agentware, where LLM-powered agents perform complex, open-ended tasks in domains such as software engineering, customer service, and data analysis. However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |

Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |

A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rethinking Technology Stack Selection with AI Coding Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11132v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now an integral part of software development workflows and are reshaping the whole process. Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[ViScratch: Using Large Language Models and Gameplay Videos for Automated Feedback in Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11065v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based programming environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in programming education, in particular for young learners. While the use of blocks helps prevent syntax errors, semantic bugs remain common and difficult to debug. Existing tools for Scratch debugging rely heavily on predefined rules or user manual inputs, and crucially, they ignore the platform's inherently visual nature. We introduce ViScratch, the first multimodal feedback generation system for Scratch that leverages both the project's block code and its generated gameplay video to diagnose and repair bugs. ViScratch uses a two-stage pipeline: a vision-language model first aligns visual symptoms with code structure to identify a single critical issue, then proposes minimal, abstract syntax tree level repairs that are verified via execution in the Scratch virtual machine. We evaluate ViScratch on a set of real-world Scratch projects against state-of-the-art LLM-based tools and human testers. Results show that gameplay video is a crucial debugging signal: ViScratch substantially outperforms prior tools in both bug identification and repair quality, even without access to project descriptions or goals. This work demonstrates that video can serve as a first-class specification in visual programming environments, opening new directions for LLM-based debugging beyond symbolic code alone.</p></details> |  |

Direct use of these APIs is difficult due to the complex input schema and verbose responses. Current benchmarks overlook these challenges, leaving a gap in assessing API readiness for agent-driven automation. We present a testing framework that systematically evaluates enterprise APIs when wrapped as Python tools for LLM-based agents. The framework generates data-aware test cases, translates them into natural language instructions, and evaluates whether agents can correctly invoke the tool, handle their inputs, and process its responses. We apply the framework to generate over 2400 test cases across different domains and develop a taxonomy of common errors, including input misinterpretation, output failures, and schema mismatches. We further classify errors to support debugging and tool refinement. Our framework provides a systematic approach to enabling enterprise APIs as reliable tools for agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality, leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging, and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches. Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code, coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators. Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers seeking to balance security with software quality in web application development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Challenging Bug Prediction and Repair Models with Synthetic Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02407v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs are essential in software engineering; many research studies in the past decades have been proposed to detect, localize, and repair bugs in software systems. Effectiveness evaluation of such techniques requires complex bugs, i.e., those that are hard to detect through testing and hard to repair through debugging. From the classic software engineering point of view, a hard-to-repair bug differs from the correct code in multiple locations, making it hard to localize and repair. Hard-to-detect bugs, on the other hand, manifest themselves under specific test inputs and reachability conditions. These two objectives, i.e., generating hard-to-detect and hard-to-repair bugs, are mostly aligned; a bug generation technique can change multiple statements to be covered only under a specific set of inputs. However, these two objectives are conflicting for learning-based techniques: A bug should have a similar code representation to the correct code in the training data to challenge a bug prediction model to distinguish them. The hard-to-repair bug definition remains the same but with a caveat: the more a bug differs from the original code, the more distant their representations are and easier to be detected. We propose BugFarm, to transform arbitrary code into multiple complex bugs. BugFarm leverages LLMs to mutate code in multiple locations (hard-to-repair). To ensure that multiple modifications do not notably change the code representation, BugFarm analyzes the attention of the underlying model and instructs LLMs to only change the least attended locations (hard-to-detect). Our comprehensive evaluation of 435k+ bugs from over 1.9M mutants generated by BUGFARM and two alternative approaches demonstrates our superiority in generating bugs that are hard to detect by learning-based bug prediction approaches and hard-to-repair by state-of-the-art learning-based program repair technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in SCAM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and repairing faults when programs fail to formally verify can be complex and time-consuming. Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIO: Multiverse Debugging in the Face of Input/Output -- Extended Version with Additional Appendices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06845v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution paths within the state space. Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e. states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse, may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is caused by the debugger. This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during regular execution. We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our techniques. As a demonstration of the approach we highlight a color dial built with a Lego Mindstorms motor, and color sensor, providing a tangible example of how our approach enables multiverse debugging for programs running on an STM32 microcontroller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This extended version provides auxiliary material to the article of the same title that will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the PACMPL issue for OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging. While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22 subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs, where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well in repository-level debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures, EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |

Their adoption requires systematic investigation to ensure responsible integration into curricula. Objective: This doctoral research aims to develop a validated framework for integrating LLMs into SE education through a multi-phase process, including taxonomies development, empirical investigation, and case studies. This paper presents the first empirical step. Method: We conducted a pilot repository mining study of 400 GitHub projects, analyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of motivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8] study. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits), software engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming assistance and debugging support (97 hits) were strongly represented. Demotivators, including plagiarism and IP concerns (385 hits), security, privacy and data integrity (87 hits), and over-reliance on AI in learning (39 hits), also appeared prominently. In contrast, demotivators such as challenges in evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded no hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical validation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes, highlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a comprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE education.</p></details> |  |

While classical software engineering has evolved with various tools and methodologies to tackle such bugs, the emergence of quantum computing presents unique challenges. Quantum software development introduces complexities due to the probabilistic nature of quantum computing, distinct algorithmic primitives, and potential hardware noise. In this paper, we introduce CircInspect, an interactive tool tailored for debugging quantum programs in Python and PennyLane. By leveraging breakpoints and real-time software development features, \toolname~empowers users to analyze isolated quantum circuit components, monitor program output, visualize structural changes, and abstract information to enhance comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the dynamic data dependency of a step that reads a variable $v$ is challenging. It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An experience-based classification of quantum bugs in quantum software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03280v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However, the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong, which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that - unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic quantum debugging strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access, Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Repair of C Programs Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01947v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the repair of C programs. We present a framework that integrates spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT. This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.</p></details> |  |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Causally Perturbed Fairness Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18719v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features (e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in engineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key challenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an intractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing on designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about data characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting their full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT. Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most directly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive counterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a causal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide a test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves as a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators. Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation, CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more efficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all cases.</p></details> | accepted by TOSEM |
| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20749v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

| **[InspectCoder: Dynamic Analysis-Enabled Self Repair through interactive LLM-Debugger Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18327v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Heuristic Guidance Based on Multiple Model Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15181v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning frameworks serve as the foundation for developing and deploying deep learning applications. To enhance the quality of deep learning frameworks, researchers have proposed numerous testing methods using deep learning models as test inputs. However, existing methods predominantly measure model bug detection effectiveness as heuristic indicators, presenting three critical limitations. Firstly, existing methods fail to quantitatively measure model's operator combination variety, potentially missing critical operator combinations that could trigger framework bugs. Secondly, existing methods neglect measuring and heuristically guiding the model execution time, resulting in the omission of numerous models potential for detecting more framework bugs within limited testing time. Thirdly, existing methods overlook correlation between different model measurements, relying simply on single-indicator heuristic guidance without considering their trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DLMMM, the first deep learning framework testing method to include multiple model measurements into heuristic guidance and fuse these measurements to achieve their trade-offs. DLMMM firstly quantitatively measures model's bug detection performance, operator combination variety, and model execution time. After that, DLMMM fuses these measurements based on their correlation to achieve their trade-offs. To further enhance testing effectiveness, DLMMM designs multi-level heuristic guidance for test input model generation. We apply DLMMM to test three widely used deep learning frameworks (including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MindSpore). The experimental results show that DLMMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

JunoBench has 111 curated and reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific out-of-order execution issue. To support reproducibility and ease of use, JunoBench offers a unified execution environment where crashes and fixes can be reliably reproduced. By providing realistic crashes and their resolutions, JunoBench facilitates bug detection, localization, and repair tailored to the interactive and iterative nature of notebook-based ML development.</p></details> |  |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v5)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p></details> |  |

| **[Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Interdependence and Complementarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18802v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition where actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture it. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications achieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions provide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |

One way to catch regressions before they reach production is executing performance tests before deployment, e.g., using microbenchmarks, which measure performance at subroutine level. In projects with many microbenchmarks, this may take several hours due to repeated execution to get accurate results, disqualifying them from frequent use in CI/CD pipelines. We propose $\mu$OpTime, a static approach to reduce the execution time of microbenchmark suites by configuring the number of repetitions for each microbenchmark. Based on the results of a full, previous microbenchmark suite run, $\mu$OpTime determines the minimal number of (measurement) repetitions with statistical stability metrics that still lead to accurate results. We evaluate $\mu$OpTime with an experimental study on 14 open-source projects written in two programming languages and five stability metrics. Our results show that (i) $\mu$OpTime reduces the total suite execution time (measurement phase) by up to 95.83% (Go) and 94.17% (Java), (ii) the choice of stability metric depends on the project and programming language, (iii) microbenchmark warmup phases have to be considered for Java projects (potentially leading to higher reductions), and (iv) $\mu$OpTime can be used to reliably detect performance regressions in CI/CD pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |
| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20749v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

| **[CPSLint: A Domain-Specific Language Providing Data Validation and Sanitisation for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18651v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Raw datasets are often too large and unstructured to work with directly, and require a data preparation process. The domain of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is no exception, as raw data typically consists of large amounts of time-series data logging the system's status in regular time intervals. Such data has to be sanity checked and preprocessed to be consumable by data-centric workflows. We introduce CPSLint, a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide data preparation for industrial CPS. We build up on the fact that many raw data collections in the CPS domain require similar actions to render them suitable for Machine-Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) workflows, yet still vary enough to hope for one universally applicable solution. CPSLint's main features include type checking and enforcing constraints through validation and remediation for data columns, such as imputing missing data from surrounding rows. More advanced features cover inference of extra CPS-specific data structures, both column-wise and row-wise. For instance, as row-wise structures, descriptive execution phases are an effective method of data compartmentalisation are extracted and prepared for ML-assisted FDI workflows. We demonstrate CPSLint's features through a proof of concept implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Abstraction Breaks Physics: Rethinking Modular Design in Quantum Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18557v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstraction is a fundamental principle in classical software engineering, which enables modularity, reusability, and scalability. However, quantum programs adhere to fundamentally different semantics, such as unitarity, entanglement, the no-cloning theorem, and the destructive nature of measurement, which introduce challenges to the safe use of classical abstraction mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental conflict in quantum software engineering: abstraction practices that are syntactically valid may violate the physical constraints of quantum computation. We present three classes of failure cases where naive abstraction breaks quantum semantics and propose a set of design principles for physically sound abstraction mechanisms. We further propose research directions, including quantum-specific type systems, effect annotations, and contract-based module design. Our goal is to initiate a systematic rethinking of abstraction in quantum software engineering, based on quantum semantics and considering engineering scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[InspectCoder: Dynamic Analysis-Enabled Self Repair through interactive LLM-Debugger Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18327v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RESCUE: Retrieval Augmented Secure Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18204v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still generate vulnerable code. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security knowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw security-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the significant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code generation with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base construction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize distillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security guidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a hierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base from top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each hierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated RESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure code generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE improves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed in-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness of individual components in RESCUE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Program Semantics Reasoning with Type Inference in System F](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23686v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM (Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '25, package released at: https://github.com/SecurityLab-UCD/TF-Bench</p></details> |

We identified a lack of support for problem discovery within AI innovation projects. To address this, we propose and evaluate DIP-AI, a discovery framework tailored to guide early-stage exploration in such initiatives. Based on a literature review, our solution proposal combines elements of ISO 12207, 5338, and Design Thinking to support the discovery of AI innovation projects, aiming at promoting higher quality deliveries and stakeholder satisfaction. We evaluated DIP-AI in an industry-academia collaboration (IAC) case study of an AI innovation project, in which participants applied DIP-AI to the discovery phase in practice and provided their perceptions about the approach's problem discovery capability, acceptance, and suggestions. The results indicate that DIP-AI is relevant and useful, particularly in facilitating problem discovery in AI projects. This research contributes to academia by sharing DIP-AI as a framework for AI problem discovery. For industry, we discuss the use of this framework in a real IAC program that develops AI innovation projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and accepted at SBQS25 - Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality.

Yet few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, potentially due to the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench has 111 curated and reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific out-of-order execution issue. To support reproducibility and ease of use, JunoBench offers a unified execution environment where crashes and fixes can be reliably reproduced. By providing realistic crashes and their resolutions, JunoBench facilitates bug detection, localization, and repair tailored to the interactive and iterative nature of notebook-based ML development.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional instructional systems, Proto emphasizes engaging, media-rich apps that go beyond basic terminal programs. Our method breaks down a full-featured OS into a set of incremental, self-contained prototypes. Each prototype introduces a minimal set of OS mechanisms, driven by the needs of specific apps. The construction process then progressively enables these apps by bringing up one mechanism at a time.

| **[Self-planning Code Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06689v5)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule solution steps prior to implementation. To this end, we introduce planning into code generation to help the model understand complex intent and reduce the difficulty of problem-solving. This paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach with large language models, which consists of two phases, namely planning phase and implementation phase. Specifically, in the planning phase, LLM outlines concise and formatted planning steps from the intent. Subsequently, in the implementation phase, the model generates code step by step, guided by the preceding planning steps. We conduct extensive experiments on various code-generation benchmarks across multiple programming languages. Experimental results show that self-planning code generation achieves a relative improvement of up to 25.4% in Pass@1 compared to direct code generation, and up to 11.9% compared to Chain-of-Thought code generation. Moreover, our self-planning approach also enhances the quality of the generated code with respect to correctness, readability, and robustness, as assessed by humans.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[CodeVisionary: An Agent-based Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13472v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities. However, they generally evaluate the generated code based on static prompts, and tend to fail for complex code scenarios which typically involve multiple requirements and require more contextual information. In addition, these approaches lack fine-grained evaluation for complex code, resulting in limited explainability. To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first agent-based evaluation framework for complex code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Requirement-guided multi-dimensional context distillation stage and (2) Fine-grained scoring and summarization stage. A comprehensive evaluation report is also generated for enhanced explainability. For validation, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 363 samples spanning 37 coding scenarios and 23 programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance among three baselines for evaluating complex code generation, outperforming the best baseline with average improvements of 0.217, 0.163, and 0.141 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively.

| **[TREAT: A Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation and Testing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17163v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models are fundamentally transforming the software engineering landscape, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks such as code generation, debugging, and testing. Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |

However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor intensive. We present an automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two real-world student code submission datasets in different programming languages.We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has proposed various methods to enhance models' CoT reasoning for code generation such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning. However, existing approaches still face three critical limitations: (1) limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths, which constrains generalization across various programming scenarios, (2) lack of quality assessment for intermediate reasoning steps, which hampers the reliability of the generated plans and code, and (3) the potential negative impact of "overthinking", potentially leading to unnecessarily complex and incorrect solutions. To address these limitations, we frame CoT code generation as a decision making problem and present SEER, a SElf-Exploring deep Reasoning framework that enables accurate and adaptive reasoning for code generation. SEER introduces three key components: (1) Diverse reasoning path exploration, which aims at exploring diverse reasoning paths and annotating intermediate steps without relying on manual experts or closed-source proprietary models; (2) Reasoning quality-aware model training, which trains a policy model for generating candidate reasoning steps and a value model for assessing their quality; and (3) Adaptive CoT reasoning, which dynamically switches between direct generation and step-by-step reasoning for different problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was completed in Feb. 2025, submitted to ICSE 2026 in Mar. 2025, received a major revision in Jun. 2025, and was finally accepted in Oct. 2025</p></details> |

Even novice developers can now design and generate complex framework-constrained software systems based on their high-level requirements with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when LLMs gradually "take the wheel" of software development, developers may only check whether the program works. They often miss security problems hidden in how the generated programs are implemented. In this work, we investigate the security properties of framework-constrained programs generated by state-of-the-art LLMs. We focus specifically on Chrome extensions due to their complex security model involving multiple privilege boundaries and isolated components. To achieve this, we built ChromeSecBench, a dataset with 140 prompts based on known vulnerable extensions. We used these prompts to instruct nine state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete Chrome extensions, and then analyzed them for vulnerabilities across three dimensions: scenario types, model differences, and vulnerability categories. Our results show that LLMs produced vulnerable programs at alarmingly high rates (18%-50%), particularly in Authentication & Identity and Cookie Management scenarios (up to 83% and 78% respectively). Most vulnerabilities exposed sensitive browser data like cookies, history, or bookmarks to untrusted code. Interestingly, we found that advanced reasoning models performed worse, generating more vulnerabilities than simpler models. These findings highlight a critical gap between LLMs' coding skills and their ability to write secure framework-constrained programs.</p></details> |  |

We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents QuanBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on quantum code generation. QuanBench includes 44 programming tasks that cover quantum algorithms, state preparation, gate decomposition, and quantum machine learning. Each task has an executable canonical solution and is evaluated by functional correctness (Pass@K) and quantum semantic equivalence (Process Fidelity). We evaluate several recent LLMs, including general-purpose and code-specialized models. The results show that current LLMs have limited capability in generating the correct quantum code, with overall accuracy below 40% and frequent semantic errors. We also analyze common failure cases, such as outdated API usage, circuit construction errors, and incorrect algorithm logic. QuanBench provides a basis for future work on improving quantum code generation with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by ASE2025</p></details> |

However, systematic analysis of these agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p></details> |  |

Rethinking Output Validation in Quantum Program Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16595v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computing continues to emerge, ensuring the quality of quantum programs has become increasingly critical. Quantum program testing has emerged as a prominent research area within the scope of quantum software engineering. While numerous approaches have been proposed to address quantum program quality assurance, our analysis reveals that most existing methods rely on measurement-based validation in practice. However, due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum programs, measurement-based validation methods face significant limitations. To investigate these limitations, we conducted an empirical study of recent research on quantum program testing, analyzing measurement-based validation methods in the literature. Our analysis categorizes existing measurement-based validation methods into two groups: distribution-level validation and output-value-level validation. We then compare measurement-based validation with statevector-based validation methods to evaluate their pros and cons. Our findings demonstrate that measurement-based validation is suitable for straightforward assessments, such as verifying the existence of specific output values, while statevector-based validation proves more effective for complicated tasks such as assessing the program behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be appeared in the proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025), NIER track, Seoul, South Korea, November 16 -20, 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of the Use of GenAI Assistants for Code Comprehension: Implications for Computing Education Research and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17894v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to comprehend code has long been recognized as an essential skill in software engineering. As programmers lean more heavily on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants to develop code solutions, it is becoming increasingly important for programmers to comprehend GenAI solutions so that they can verify their appropriateness and properly integrate them into existing code. At the same time, GenAI tools are increasingly being enlisted to provide programmers with tailored explanations of code written both by GenAI and humans. Thus, in computing education, GenAI presents new challenges and opportunities for learners who are trying to comprehend computer programs. To provide computing educators with evidence-based guidance on the use of GenAI to facilitate code comprehension and to identify directions for future research, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of state-of-the-art approaches and tools that leverage GenAI to enhance code comprehension. Our SLR focuses on 31 studies published between 2022 and 2024. Despite their potential, GenAI assistants often yield inaccurate or unclear explanations, and novice programmers frequently struggle to craft effective prompts, thereby impeding their ability to leverage GenAI to aid code comprehension. Our review classifies GenAI-based approaches and tools, identifies methods used to study them, and summarizes the empirical evaluations of their effectiveness. We consider the implications of our findings for computing education research and practice, and identify directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TritonRL: Training LLMs to Think and Code Triton Without Cheating](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17891v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), the demand for automated, high-performance system kernels has emerged as a key enabler for accelerating development and deployment. We introduce TritonRL, a domain-specialized LLM for Triton kernel generation, trained with a novel training framework that enables robust and automated kernel synthesis. Unlike general-purpose programming languages, Triton kernel generation faces unique challenges due to data scarcity and incomplete evaluation criteria, vulnerable to reward hacking. Our approach addresses these challenges end-to-end by distilling Triton-specific knowledge through supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets, and further improving code quality via reinforcement learning (RL) with robust, verifiable rewards and hierarchical reward assignment. Our RL framework robustly detects reward hacking and guides both reasoning traces and code tokens through fine-grained verification and hierarchical reward decomposition, enabling the model to generate high-quality Triton kernels that can truly replace existing modules. With robust and fine-grained evaluation, our experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that TritonRL achieves state-of-the-art correctness and speedup, surpassing all other Triton-specific models and underscoring the effectiveness of our RL-based training paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Aligned Code Readability Assessment with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16579v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code readability is crucial for software comprehension and maintenance, yet difficult to assess at scale. Traditional static metrics often fail to capture the subjective, context-sensitive nature of human judgments. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative, but their behavior as readability evaluators remains underexplored. We introduce CoReEval, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLM-based code readability assessment, comprising over 1.4 million model-snippet-prompt evaluations across 10 state of the art LLMs. The benchmark spans 3 programming languages (Java, Python, CUDA), 2 code types (functional code and unit tests), 4 prompting strategies (ZSL, FSL, CoT, ToT), 9 decoding settings, and developer-guided prompts tailored to junior and senior personas. We compare LLM outputs against human annotations and a validated static model, analyzing numerical alignment (MAE, Pearson's, Spearman's) and justification quality (sentiment, aspect coverage, semantic clustering). Our findings show that developer-guided prompting grounded in human-defined readability dimensions improves alignment in structured contexts, enhances explanation quality, and enables lightweight personalization through persona framing. However, increased score variability highlights trade-offs between alignment, stability, and interpretability. CoReEval provides a robust foundation for prompt engineering, model alignment studies, and human in the loop evaluation, with applications in education, onboarding, and CI/CD pipelines where LLMs can serve as explainable, adaptable reviewers.</p></details> |  |

Objective: This paper proposes and empirically applies a causal model to help educators scaffold responsible GenAI use in Software Engineering (SE) education. The model identifies how professor actions, student factors, and GenAI tool characteristics influence students' usage of GenAI tools. Method: Using a design-based research approach, we applied the model in two contexts: (1) revising four extensive lab assignments of a final-year Software Testing course at Queen's University Belfast (QUB), and (2) embedding GenAI-related competencies into the curriculum of a newly developed SE BSc program at Azerbaijan Technical University (AzTU). Interventions included GenAI usage declarations, output validation tasks, peer-review of AI artifacts, and career-relevant messaging. Results: TBD Conclusions: TBD</p></details> |  |
| **[Humanity's Last Code Exam: Can Advanced LLMs Conquer Human's Hardest Code Competition?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12713v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is a core capability of large language models (LLMs), yet mainstream benchmarks (e.g., APPs and LiveCodeBench) contain questions with medium-level difficulty and pose no challenge to advanced LLMs. To better reflected the advanced reasoning and code generation ability, We introduce Humanity's Last Code Exam (HLCE), comprising 235 most challenging problems from the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC World Finals) and the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) spanning 2010 - 2024. As part of HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming. Our code and dataset are also public available(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[SemOpt: LLM-Driven Code Optimization via Rule-Based Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16384v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code optimization aims to improve performance in programs by refactoring code, and recent studies focus on utilizing LLMs for the optimization. Typical existing approaches mine optimization commits from open-source codebases to construct a large-scale knowledge base, then employ information retrieval techniques such as BM25 to retrieve relevant optimization examples for hotspot code locations, thereby guiding LLMs to optimize these hotspots. However, since semantically equivalent optimizations can manifest in syntactically dissimilar code snippets, current retrieval methods often fail to identify pertinent examples, leading to suboptimal optimization performance. This limitation significantly reduces the effectiveness of existing optimization approaches. To address these limitations, we propose SemOpt, a novel framework that leverages static program analysis to precisely identify optimizable code segments, retrieve the corresponding optimization strategies, and generate the optimized results. SemOpt consists of three key components: (1) A strategy library builder that extracts and clusters optimization strategies from real-world code modifications. (2) A rule generator that generates Semgrep static analysis rules to capture the condition of applying the optimization strategy. (3) An optimizer that utilizes the strategy library to generate optimized code results. All the three components are powered by LLMs. On our benchmark containing 151 optimization tasks, SemOpt demonstrates its effectiveness under different LLMs by increasing the number of successful optimizations by 1.38 to 28 times compared to the baseline. Moreover, on popular large-scale C/C++ projects, it can improve individual performance metrics by 5.04% to 218.07%, demonstrating its practical utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLCPD: A Unified Multi-Language Code Parsing Dataset with Universal AST Schema](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16357v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the MultiLang Code Parser Dataset (MLCPD), a large-scale, language-agnostic dataset unifying syntactic and structural representations of code across ten major programming languages. MLCPD contains over seven million parsed source files normalized under our proposed universal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) schema, enabling consistent cross-language reasoning, structural learning, and multilingual software analysis. Unlike existing corpora that focus purely on token-level code or isolated parsers, MLCPD provides both hierarchical tree representations and rich metadata for every file, ensuring lossless syntactic coverage and structural uniformity. Each entry includes a normalized schema, language-level metadata, and abstracted node semantics stored in Parquet format for scalable retrieval. Empirical analyses reveal strong cross-language structural regularities-demonstrating that syntactic graphs from languages as diverse as Python, Java, and Go can be aligned under a shared schema. We release the dataset publicly on Hugging Face and the accompanying codebase on GitHub, which includes complete pipelines for dataset reproduction, grammar compilation, and a visualization tool for exploring the unified AST across languages. Together, these resources establish MLCPD as an open, reproducible foundation for future research in cross-language representation learning and program analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms, and 34 references.

| **[VERINA: Benchmarking Verifiable Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23135v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software development, but ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code remains challenging and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment -- offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs' benefits in coding. Yet, there exists a significant gap in evaluation: current benchmarks often focus on only individual components rather than providing a holistic evaluation framework of all tasks. In this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code, specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive test suites. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant challenges in verifiable code generation, especially in proof generation, underscoring the need for improving LLM-based theorem provers in verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves a 61.4\% code correctness rate, 51.0\% for specification soundness and completeness, and a mere 3.6\% proof success rate (based on one trial per task). We hope Verina will catalyze progress in verifiable code generation by providing a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark. We release our dataset on https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunblaze-ucb/verina and our evaluation code on https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/verina.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Test Driven Development with Large Language Models for Reliable and Verifiable Spreadsheet Code Generation: A Research Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15585v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Enhancing Code Review through Fuzzing and Likely Invariants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15512v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many software projects employ manual code review to gatekeep defects and vulnerabilities in the code before integration. However, reviewers often work under time pressure and rely primarily on static inspection, leaving the dynamic aspects of the program unexplored. Dynamic analyses could reveal such behaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is typically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise code with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but unexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze program behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible to reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context. We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify potential bugs. The impact of code changes can be automatically captured at runtime. Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties consistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals of behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended changes and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes. We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from non-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program versions. By surfacing such differences, it provides insights into which code blocks may need closer attention. In our evaluation, FuzzSight flagged 75% of regression bugs and up to 80% of vulnerabilities uncovered by 24-hour fuzzing. It also outperformed SAST in identifying buggy code blocks, achieving ten times higher detection rates with fewer false alarms. In summary, FuzzSight demonstrates the potential and value of leveraging fuzzing and invariant analysis for early-stage code review, bridging static inspection with dynamic behavioral insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Experimental Study of Real-Life LLM-Proposed Performance Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15494v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, but can they generate fast code? In this paper, we study this question using a dataset of 65 real-world tasks mined from open-source Java programs. We specifically select tasks where developers achieved significant speedups, and employ an automated pipeline to generate patches for these issues using two leading LLMs under four prompt variations. By rigorously benchmarking the results against the baseline and human-authored solutions, we demonstrate that LLM-generated code indeed improves performance over the baseline in most cases. However, patches proposed by human developers outperform LLM fixes by a statistically significant margin, indicating that LLMs often fall short of finding truly optimal solutions. We further find that LLM solutions are semantically identical or similar to the developer optimization idea in approximately two-thirds of cases, whereas they propose a more original idea in the remaining one-third. However, these original ideas only occasionally yield substantial performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repairing Tool Calls Using Post-tool Execution Reflection and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17874v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems interact with external systems by calling tools such as Python functions, REST API endpoints, or command line tools such as kubectl in Kubernetes. These tool calls often fail for various syntactic and semantic reasons. Some less obvious semantic errors can only be identified and resolved after analyzing the tool's response. To repair these errors, we develop a post-tool execution reflection component that combines large language model (LLM)-based reflection with domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using documents describing both the specific tool being called and troubleshooting documents related to the tool. For this paper, we focus on the use case of the kubectl command line tool to manage Kubernetes, a platform for orchestrating cluster applications. Through a larger empirical study and a smaller manual evaluation, we find that our RAG-based reflection will repair kubectl commands such that they are both more likely to successfully execute (pass rate) for 55% of our models evaluated and 36% more likely to correctly answer the user query on average. We find that troubleshooting documents improve pass rate compared to official documentation by an average of 10%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory-Efficient Large Language Models for Program Repair with Semantic-Guided Patch Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16655v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we first show that increases in beam size, even for small-sized LLMs (1B-7B params), require extensive GPU usage, leading to up to 80% of recurring crashes due to memory overloads in LLM-based APR. Seemingly simple solutions to reduce memory consumption are (1) to quantize LLM models, i.e., converting the weights of an LLM from high-precision values to lower-precision ones, and (2) to make beam search sequential, i.e., forwarding each beam through the model sequentially and then concatenating them back into a single output. However, we show that these approaches still do not work via both theoretical analysis and experiments. To address this, we introduce FLAMES, a novel LLM-based APR technique that employs semantic-guided patch generation to enhance repair effectiveness and memory efficiency. Unlike conventional methods that rely on beam search, FLAMES utilizes greedy decoding to enhance memory efficiency while steering the search towards more potentially good repair candidates via a semantic-guided best-first search algorithm. At each decoding step, FLAMES uses semantic feedback from test validation, such as the number of passing and failing test cases, to select the most promising token to explore further. Our empirical evaluation on Defects4J shows thatFLAMES substantially reduces memory consumption by up to 83% compared to LLM-based APR without compromising time efficiency. Moreover, FLAMES correctly fixes 133 bugs on Defects4J, fixing 10 bugs more than the best baseline. Additionally, these improvements also generalize to the HumanEval-Java and TransformedD4J datasets, where FLAMES generates 12% and 36.5% more correct patches, respectively, than the best baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026, Research Track</p></details> |

In particular, we design an adaptive program repair method based on issue description response, called SIADAFIX. The proposed method utilizes slow thinking bug fix agent to complete complex program repair tasks, and employs fast thinking workflow decision components to optimize and classify issue descriptions, using issue description response results to guide the orchestration of bug fix agent workflows. SIADAFIX adaptively selects three repair modes, i.e., easy, middle and hard mode, based on problem complexity. It employs fast generalization for simple problems and test-time scaling techniques for complex problems. Experimental results on the SWE-bench Lite show that the proposed method achieves 60.67% pass@1 performance using the Claude-4 Sonnet model, reaching state-of-the-art levels among all open-source methods. SIADAFIX effectively balances repair efficiency and accuracy, providing new insights for automated program repair. Our code is available at https://github.com/liauto-siada/siada-cli.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

Besides measuring the correctness of variable predictions during execution simulation, CES introduces the notion of coherence to determine whether the simulation complies with commonsense execution logic, even if the predicted values along the simulations are incorrect. This enables CES to rule out suspiciously correct output predictions due to reasoning shortcuts, hallucinations, or potential data leakage. CES also introduces a novel metric to measure reasoning consistency across tests with the same or different prime path coverage in a spectrum: strong, weak, and random. Evaluating 16 LLMs (including three reasoning LLMs) using CES indicates 81.42% coherent execution simulation on HumanEval, 46.92% and 53.08% of which result in correct and incorrect output predictions. Frontier LLMs such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek-R1 have the most incoherent execution reasoning, mostly due to natural language shortcuts. Despite relatively coherent execution simulation, LLMs' reasoning performance across different tests is inconsistent, mostly random (48.87%) or weak (45.37%), potentially explaining their weakness in programming tasks that require path-sensitive program analysis to succeed. We also compare CES with bug prediction/localization/repair, which intuitively requires control- and data-flow awareness. We observe that LLMs barely incorporate execution reasoning into their analysis for bug-related tasks, and their success is primarily due to inherent abilities in pattern matching or natural language shortcuts, if not data leakage. Without reasoning, there is a threat to the generalizability of LLMs in dealing with unseen bugs or patterns in different contexts. CES can be used to vet the suspicious success of LLMs in these tasks systematically.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we investigate the efficacy of RAG-based unit test generation for machine learning (ML/DL) APIs and analyze the impact of different knowledge sources on their effectiveness. We examine three domain-specific sources for RAG: (1) API documentation (official guidelines), (2) GitHub issues (developer-reported resolutions), and (3) StackOverflow Q&As (community-driven solutions). Our study focuses on five widely used Python-based ML/DL libraries, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Google JAX, and XGBoost, targeting the most-used APIs. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs -- GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Mistral MoE 8x22B, and Llama 3.1 405B -- across three strategies: basic instruction prompting, Basic RAG, and API-level RAG. Quantitatively, we assess syntactical and dynamic correctness and line coverage. While RAG does not enhance correctness, RAG improves line coverage by 6.5% on average. We found that GitHub issues result in the best improvement in line coverage by providing edge cases from various issues. We also found that these generated unit tests can help detect new bugs. Specifically, 28 bugs were detected, 24 unique bugs were reported to developers, ten were confirmed, four were rejected, and ten are awaiting developers' confirmation. Our findings highlight RAG's potential in unit test generation for improving test coverage with well-targeted knowledge sources. Future work should focus on retrieval techniques that identify documents with unique program states to optimize RAG-based unit test generation further.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages + reference.

As a result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Last Dependency Crusade: Solving Python Dependency Conflicts with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16191v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resolving Python dependency issues remains a tedious and error-prone process, forcing developers to manually trial compatible module versions and interpreter configurations. Existing automated solutions, such as knowledge-graph-based and database-driven methods, face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies. This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically repair dependency issues in Python programs. We propose PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that iteratively infers missing or incorrect dependencies. PLLM builds a test environment where the LLM proposes module combinations, observes execution feedback, and refines its predictions using natural language processing (NLP) to parse error messages. We evaluate PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a curated collection of real-world Python programs. Using this benchmark, we explore multiple PLLM configurations, including six open-source LLMs evaluated both with and without RAG. Our findings show that RAG consistently improves fix rates, with the best performance achieved by Gemma-2 9B when combined with RAG. Compared to two state-of-the-art baselines, PyEGo and ReadPyE, PLLM achieves significantly higher fix rates; +15.97\% more than ReadPyE and +21.58\% more than PyEGo. Further analysis shows that PLLM is especially effective for projects with numerous dependencies and those using specialized numerical or machine-learning libraries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print - Accepted at the first annual workshop on Agentic Software Engineering (AgenticSE) co-located with ASE'25</p></details> |
| **[Augmenting Smart Contract Decompiler Output through Fine-grained Dependency Analysis and LLM-facilitated Semantic Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08670v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate method identification, incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically, \system{} constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance, achieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable types, and 80.65% for contract attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author version of the article accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Benchmarks and Solutions in Software Engineering of LLM-Empowered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09721v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration. This survey serves as a foundational guide for advancing LLM-driven software engineering. We maintain a GitHub repository that continuously updates the reviewed and related papers at https://github.com/lisaGuojl/LLM-Agent-SE-Survey.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[PathFix: Automated Program Repair with Expected Path](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14341v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) techniques are effective in fixing inevitable defects in software, enhancing development efficiency and software robustness. However, due to the difficulty of generating precise specifications, existing APR methods face two main challenges: generating too many plausible patch candidates and overfitting them to partial test cases. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new APR method named PathFix, which leverages path-sensitive constraints extracted from correct execution paths to generate patches for repairing buggy code. It is based on one observation: if a buggy program is repairable, at least one expected path is supposed to replace the fault path in the patched program. PathFix operates in four main steps. First, it traces fault paths reaching the fault output in the buggy program. Second, it derives expected paths by analyzing the desired correct output on the control flow graph, where an expected path defines how a feasible patch leads to the correct execution. Third, PathFix generates and evaluates patches by solving state constraints along the expected path. Fourth, we validate the correctness of the generated patch. To further enhance repair performance and mitigate scalability issues introduced by path-sensitive analysis, we integrate a large language model (LLM) into our framework. Experimental results show that PathFix outperforms existing solutions, particularly in handling complex program structures such as loops and recursion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of a paper accepted at SecDev 2025 (IEEE)</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Study of Time Limit Exceeded Errors in Online Programming Assignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14339v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online programming platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode attract millions of users seeking to learn to program or refine their skills for industry interviews. A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon their submissions after repeated TLE failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely performance issues. Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same 1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid, Knowledge-Guided Evolutionary Framework for Personalized Compiler Auto-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14292v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiler pass auto-tuning is critical for enhancing software performance, yet finding the optimal pass sequence for a specific program is an NP-hard problem. Traditional, general-purpose optimization flags like -O3 and -Oz adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, often failing to unlock a program's full performance potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Hybrid, Knowledge-Guided Evolutionary Framework. This framework intelligently guides online, personalized optimization using knowledge extracted from a large-scale offline analysis phase. During the offline stage, we construct a comprehensive compilation knowledge base composed of four key components: (1) Pass Behavioral Vectors to quantitatively capture the effectiveness of each optimization; (2) Pass Groups derived from clustering these vectors based on behavior similarity; (3) a Synergy Pass Graph to model beneficial sequential interactions; and (4) a library of Prototype Pass Sequences evolved for distinct program types. In the online stage, a bespoke genetic algorithm leverages this rich knowledge base through specially designed, knowledge-infused genetic operators. These operators transform the search by performing semantically-aware recombination and targeted, restorative mutations. On a suite of seven public datasets, our framework achieves an average of 11.0% additional LLVM IR instruction reduction over the highly-optimized opt -Oz baseline, demonstrating its state-of-the-art capability in discovering personalized, high-performance optimization sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Caruca: Effective and Efficient Specification Mining for Opaque Software Components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14279v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A wealth of state-of-the-art systems demonstrate impressive improvements in performance, security, and reliability on programs composed of opaque components, such as Unix shell commands. To reason about commands, these systems require partial specifications. However, creating such specifications is a manual, laborious, and error-prone process, limiting the practicality of these systems. This paper presents Caruca, a system for automatic specification mining for opaque commands. To overcome the challenge of language diversity across commands, Caruca first instruments a large language model to translate a command's user-facing documentation into a structured invocation syntax. Using this representation, Caruca explores the space of syntactically valid command invocations and execution environments. Caruca concretely executes each command-environment pair, interposing at the system-call and filesystem level to extract key command properties such as parallelizability and filesystem pre- and post-conditions. These properties can be exported in multiple specification formats and are immediately usable by existing systems. Applying Caruca across 60 GNU Coreutils, POSIX, and third-party commands across several specification-dependent systems shows that Caruca generates correct specifications for all but one case, completely eliminating manual effort from the process and currently powering the full specifications for a state-of-the-art static analysis tool.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Snippet-Alignment Data Augmentation for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15004v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation aims to translate the code from its source language to the target language and is used in various software development scenarios. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their capabilities in code translation, and parallel corpora play a crucial role in training models for code translation. Parallel corpora can be categorized into program-alignment (PA) and snippet-alignment (SA) data. Although PA data has complete context and is suitable for semantic alignment learning, it may not provide adequate fine-grained training signals due to its extended length, while the brevity of SA data enables more fine-grained alignment learning. Due to limited parallel corpora, researchers explore several augmentation methods for code translation. Previous studies mainly focus on augmenting PA data. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method that leverages LLMs to generate SA data automatically. To fully leverage both PA data and SA data, we explore a simple yet effective two-stage training strategy, which consistently enhances model performance compared to fine-tuning solely on PA data. Experiments on TransCoder-test demonstrate that our augmented SA data combined with the two-stage training approach yields consistent improvements over the baseline, achieving a maximum gain of 3.78% on pass@k.</p></details> |  |

Scenic, a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs) suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14 prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics (compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11). EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88 percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting, Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options for autonomous-driving scenario programming.</p></details> |  |

| **[EffiReasonTrans: RL-Optimized Reasoning for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18863v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation is a crucial task in software development and maintenance. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model, DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each (source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally, EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into agent-based frameworks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/EffiReasonTrans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlining Acceptance Test Generation for Mobile Applications Through Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18861v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile acceptance testing remains a bottleneck in modern software development, particularly for cross-platform mobile development using frameworks like Flutter. While developers increasingly rely on automated testing tools, creating and maintaining acceptance test artifacts still demands significant manual effort. To help tackle this issue, we introduce AToMIC, an automated framework leveraging specialized Large Language Models to generate Gherkin scenarios, Page Objects, and executable UI test scripts directly from requirements (JIRA tickets) and recent code changes. Applied to BMW's MyBMW app, covering 13 real-world issues in a 170+ screen codebase, AToMIC produced executable test artifacts in under five minutes per feature on standard hardware. The generated artifacts were of high quality: 93.3% of Gherkin scenarios were syntactically correct upon generation, 78.8% of PageObjects ran without manual edits, and 100% of generated UI tests executed successfully. In a survey, all practitioners reported time savings (often a full developer-day per feature) and strong confidence in adopting the approach. These results confirm AToMIC as a scalable, practical solution for streamlining acceptance test creation and maintenance in industrial mobile projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Interdependence and Complementarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18802v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition where actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture it. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications achieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions provide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |
| **[FeClustRE: Hierarchical Clustering and Semantic Tagging of App Features from User Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18799v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[Context and motivation.] Extracting features from mobile app reviews is increasingly important for multiple requirements engineering (RE) tasks. However, existing methods struggle to turn noisy, ambiguous feedback into interpretable insights. [Question/problem.] Syntactic approaches lack semantic depth, while large language models (LLMs) often miss fine-grained features or fail to structure them coherently. In addition, existing methods output flat lists of features without semantic organization, limiting interpretation and comparability. Consequently, current feature extraction approaches do not provide structured, meaningful representations of app features. As a result, practitioners face fragmented information that hinder requirement analysis, prioritization, and cross-app comparison, among other use cases. [Principal ideas/results.] In this context, we propose FeClustRE, a framework integrating hybrid feature extraction, hierarchical clustering with auto-tuning and LLM-based semantic labelling. FeClustRE combines syntactic parsing with LLM enrichment, organizes features into clusters, and automatically generates meaningful taxonomy labels. We evaluate FeClustRE on public benchmarks for extraction correctness and on a sample study of generative AI assistant app reviews for clustering quality, semantic coherence, and interpretability. [Contribution.] Overall, FeClustRE delivers (1) a hybrid framework for feature extraction and taxonomy generation, (2) an auto-tuning mechanism with a comprehensive evaluation methodology, and (3) open-source and replicable implementation. These contributions bridge user feedback and feature understanding, enabling deeper insights into current and emerging requirements.</p></details> | Under review |

Characterizing Datasets for LLM-based Requirements Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18787v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[Context] Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on domain-specific datasets to achieve robust performance across training and inference stages. However, in Requirements Engineering (RE), data scarcity remains a persistent limitation reported in surveys and mapping studies. [Question/Problem] Although there are multiple datasets supporting LLM-based RE tasks (LLM4RE), they are fragmented and poorly characterized, limiting reuse and comparability. This research addresses the limited visibility and characterization of datasets used in LLM4RE. We investigate which public datasets are employed, how they can be systematically characterized, and which RE tasks and dataset descriptors remain under-represented. [Ideas/Results] To address this, we conduct a systematic mapping study to identify and analyse datasets used in LLM4RE research. A total of 62 publicly available datasets are referenced across 43 primary studies. Each dataset is characterized along descriptors such as artifact type, granularity, RE stage, task, domain, and language. Preliminary findings show multiple research gaps, including limited coverage for elicitation tasks, scarce datasets for management activities beyond traceability, and limited multilingual availability. [Contribution] This research preview offers a public catalogue and structured characterization scheme to support dataset selection, comparison, and reuse in LLM4RE research. Future work will extend the scope to grey literature, as well as integration with open dataset and benchmark repositories.</p></details> | Under review |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Causally Perturbed Fairness Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18719v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features (e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in engineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key challenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an intractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing on designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about data characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting their full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT. Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most directly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive counterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a causal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide a test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves as a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators. Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation, CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more efficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all cases.</p></details> | accepted by TOSEM |

This review synthesizes real-life experiences of using alternative (non-traditional) contracting and funding approaches. The focus is on identifying approaches that align better with agile principles and understanding the motivations, benefits, and challenges these alternatives present. A systematic literature review was conducted in SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, where we identified 38 relevant peer-reviewed empirical studies from private and public sector contexts. Four alternative funding and four alternative contracting approaches were identified. Organizations were motivated to adopt these alternative approaches because traditional approaches often proved too rigid, conflicted with agile principles, hindered effective client-contractor collaboration, and limited profitability. The benefits of these alternatives included higher client satisfaction, reduced contractor risk, and more efficient resource utilization. Adopting alternative funding and contracting approaches may promote flexibility and efficiency in agile projects but also presents cultural and structural challenges, increases the risk of scope creep and analysis paralysis, and requires additional effort in terms of time and resources. The context of the organization matters highly in selecting a suitable approach, such as the organizational readiness in terms of its leaders, people, and systems. Thus, instead of wholly adopting alternative approaches and introducing changes abruptly, organizations may benefit from starting with hybrid approaches that balance flexibility and control and progressively transition to fully flexible approaches tailored to their needs</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 6 tables, 6 figures and 3 appendices</p></details> |

One way to catch regressions before they reach production is executing performance tests before deployment, e.g., using microbenchmarks, which measure performance at subroutine level. In projects with many microbenchmarks, this may take several hours due to repeated execution to get accurate results, disqualifying them from frequent use in CI/CD pipelines. We propose $\mu$OpTime, a static approach to reduce the execution time of microbenchmark suites by configuring the number of repetitions for each microbenchmark. Based on the results of a full, previous microbenchmark suite run, $\mu$OpTime determines the minimal number of (measurement) repetitions with statistical stability metrics that still lead to accurate results. We evaluate $\mu$OpTime with an experimental study on 14 open-source projects written in two programming languages and five stability metrics. Our results show that (i) $\mu$OpTime reduces the total suite execution time (measurement phase) by up to 95.83% (Go) and 94.17% (Java), (ii) the choice of stability metric depends on the project and programming language, (iii) microbenchmark warmup phases have to be considered for Java projects (potentially leading to higher reductions), and (iv) $\mu$OpTime can be used to reliably detect performance regressions in CI/CD pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |
| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20749v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

The domain of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is no exception, as raw data typically consists of large amounts of time-series data logging the system's status in regular time intervals. Such data has to be sanity checked and preprocessed to be consumable by data-centric workflows. We introduce CPSLint, a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide data preparation for industrial CPS. We build up on the fact that many raw data collections in the CPS domain require similar actions to render them suitable for Machine-Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) workflows, yet still vary enough to hope for one universally applicable solution. CPSLint's main features include type checking and enforcing constraints through validation and remediation for data columns, such as imputing missing data from surrounding rows. More advanced features cover inference of extra CPS-specific data structures, both column-wise and row-wise. For instance, as row-wise structures, descriptive execution phases are an effective method of data compartmentalisation are extracted and prepared for ML-assisted FDI workflows. We demonstrate CPSLint's features through a proof of concept implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Optimized Benchmarking Platform for CI/CD Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18640v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance regressions in large-scale software systems can lead to substantial resource inefficiencies, making their early detection critical. Frequent benchmarking is essential for identifying these regressions and maintaining service-level agreements (SLAs). Performance benchmarks, however, are resource-intensive and time-consuming, which is a major challenge for integration into Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Although numerous benchmark optimization techniques have been proposed to accelerate benchmark execution, there is currently no practical system that integrates these optimizations seamlessly into real-world CI/CD pipelines. In this vision paper, we argue that the field of benchmark optimization remains under-explored in key areas that hinder its broader adoption. We identify three central challenges to enabling frequent and efficient benchmarking: (a) the composability of benchmark optimization strategies, (b) automated evaluation of benchmarking results, and (c) the usability and complexity of applying these strategies as part of CI/CD systems in practice. We also introduce a conceptual cloud-based benchmarking framework handling these challenges transparently. By presenting these open problems, we aim to stimulate research toward making performance regression detection in CI/CD systems more practical and effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models in detecting Secrets in Android Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18601v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile apps often embed authentication secrets, such as API keys, tokens, and client IDs, to integrate with cloud services. However, developers often hardcode these credentials into Android apps, exposing them to extraction through reverse engineering. Once compromised, adversaries can exploit secrets to access sensitive data, manipulate resources, or abuse APIs, resulting in significant security and financial risks. Existing detection approaches, such as regex-based analysis, static analysis, and machine learning, are effective for identifying known patterns but are fundamentally limited: they require prior knowledge of credential structures, API signatures, or training data. In this paper, we propose SecretLoc, an LLM-based approach for detecting hardcoded secrets in Android apps. SecretLoc goes beyond pattern matching; it leverages contextual and structural cues to identify secrets without relying on predefined patterns or labeled training sets. Using a benchmark dataset from the literature, we demonstrate that SecretLoc detects secrets missed by regex-, static-, and ML-based methods, including previously unseen types of secrets. In total, we discovered 4828 secrets that were undetected by existing approaches, discovering more than 10 "new" types of secrets, such as OpenAI API keys, GitHub Access Tokens, RSA private keys, and JWT tokens, and more. We further extend our analysis to newly crawled apps from Google Play, where we uncovered and responsibly disclosed additional hardcoded secrets. Across a set of 5000 apps, we detected secrets in 2124 apps (42.5%), several of which were confirmed and remediated by developers after we contacted them. Our results reveal a dual-use risk: if analysts can uncover these secrets with LLMs, so can attackers. This underscores the urgent need for proactive secret management and stronger mitigation practices across the mobile ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

While script-based verifiers are widely adopted for evaluation, they suffer from limited scalability and inability to provide step-wise assessment. Reward models offer promising alternatives, but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench, comprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward Benchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic assessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse, Practical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10 software categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels (25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through carefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure reliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and Insights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3 prompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including insufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the superiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation. (4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our comprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that significantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting and strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and 93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially outperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing methods rely solely on outcome rewards, without explicitly optimizing verification or leveraging reliable signals from realistic environments, leading to unreliable self-verification and limited test-time scaling. To address this, we widen the verification-generation asymmetry by explicitly optimizing self-verification, making it a reliable driver of deeper test-time scaling. We introduce ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that evolves code generation through self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal structures long-horizon reasoning as iterative generation-verification turns and incorporates TAPO for turn-level credit assignment, fostering the co-evolution of code and test generation. At inference, this strengthened self-verification enables the model to use self-constructed tests and tool feedback to continuously evolve code for 20+ turns on LiveCodeBench despite training on only three. It also significantly improves Pass@k, indicating stronger exploration that expands the reasoning boundaries of the base model. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable paradigm for RL training and test-time scaling, paving the way for more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework based on five key criteria: Business Process Orchestration, UI/UX Customization, Integration and Interoperability, Governance and Security, and AI-Enhanced Automation. We propose a weighted scoring model that allows organizations to quantitatively assess and compare different low-code platforms based on their specific requirements and strategic priorities. The framework addresses the gap between marketing-driven platform comparisons and rigorous, context-specific evaluation methodologies. Through empirical validation in enterprise environments, we demonstrate how this structured approach can significantly improve decision-making outcomes and reduce the risk of platform lock-in or inadequate solution selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figure.

However, its reliability in open-ended tasks with dynamic environments and complex interactions remains unexplored. To bridge the gap, we introduce WebDevJudge, a systematic benchmark for assessing LLM-as-a-judge performance in web development, with support for both non-interactive evaluation based on static observations and continuous interactive evaluation with a dynamic web environment. WebDevJudge comprises human preference labels over paired web implementations, annotated with structured and query-grounded rubrics to ensure high-quality ground truth. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate various evaluators, including LLMs, MLLMs, and agentic workflows. We systematically investigate the impact of different paradigms and guidance mechanisms. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between LLM judges and human experts. In-depth analysis indicates this gap stems from fundamental model limitations, including failures in recognizing functional equivalence, verifying task feasibility, and mitigating bias. Overall, WebDevJudge presents a significant challenge to LLM-as-a-judge, offering insights to guide future research toward developing more reliable and capable automated evaluators for complicated scenarios. Code and data are available at https://github.com/lcy2723/WebDevJudge.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Abstraction Breaks Physics: Rethinking Modular Design in Quantum Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18557v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstraction is a fundamental principle in classical software engineering, which enables modularity, reusability, and scalability. However, quantum programs adhere to fundamentally different semantics, such as unitarity, entanglement, the no-cloning theorem, and the destructive nature of measurement, which introduce challenges to the safe use of classical abstraction mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental conflict in quantum software engineering: abstraction practices that are syntactically valid may violate the physical constraints of quantum computation. We present three classes of failure cases where naive abstraction breaks quantum semantics and propose a set of design principles for physically sound abstraction mechanisms. We further propose research directions, including quantum-specific type systems, effect annotations, and contract-based module design. Our goal is to initiate a systematic rethinking of abstraction in quantum software engineering, based on quantum semantics and considering engineering scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[PEACE: Towards Efficient Project-Level Efficiency Optimization via Hybrid Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17142v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capability in code generation, but their potential in code efficiency optimization remains underexplored. Previous LLM-based code efficiency optimization approaches exclusively focus on function-level optimization and overlook interaction between functions, failing to generalize to real-world development scenarios. Code editing techniques show great potential for conducting project-level optimization, yet they face challenges associated with invalid edits and suboptimal internal functions. To address these gaps, we propose Peace, a novel hybrid framework for Project-level code Efficiency optimization through Automatic Code Editing, which also ensures the overall correctness and integrity of the project. Peace integrates three key phases: dependency-aware optimizing function sequence construction, valid associated edits identification, and efficiency optimization editing iteration. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of Peace, we construct PeacExec, the first benchmark comprising 146 real-world optimization tasks from 47 high-impact GitHub Python projects, along with highly qualified test cases and executable environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate Peace's superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 69.2% correctness rate (pass@1), +46.9% opt rate, and 0.840 speedup in execution efficiency. Notably, our Peace outperforms all baselines by significant margins, particularly in complex optimization tasks with multiple functions. Moreover, extensive experiments are also conducted to validate the contributions of each component in Peace, as well as the rationale and effectiveness of our hybrid framework design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demonstrators for Industrial Cyber-Physical System Research: A Requirements Hierarchy Driven by Software-Intensive Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18534v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the challenges apparent in the organisation of research projects is the uncertainties around the subject of demonstrators. A precise and detailed elicitation of the coverage for project demonstrators is often an afterthought and not sufficiently detailed during proposal writing. This practice leads to continuous confusion and a mismatch between targeted and achievable demonstration of results, hindering progress. The reliance on the TRL scale as a loose descriptor does not help either. We propose a demonstrator requirements elaboration framework aiming to evaluate the feasibility of targeted demonstrations, making realistic adjustments, and assist in describing requirements. In doing so, we define 5 hierarchical levels of demonstration, clearly connected to expectations, e.g., work package interaction, and also connected to the project's industrial use-cases. The considered application scope in this paper is the domain of software-intensive systems and industrial cyber-physical systems. A complete validation is not accessible, as it would require application of our framework at the start of a project and observing the results at the end, taking 4-5 years. Nonetheless, we have applied it to two research projects from our portfolio, one at the early and another at the final stages, revealing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mining Service Behavior for Stateful Service Emulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18519v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise software systems are increasingly integrating with diverse services to meet expanding business demands. Testing these highly interconnected systems presents a challenge due to the need for access to the connected services. Service virtualization has emerged as a widely used technique to derive service models from recorded interactions, for service response generation during system testing. Various methods have been proposed to emulate actual service behavior based on these interactions, but most fail to account for the service's state, which reduces the accuracy of service emulation and the realism of the testing environment, especially when dealing with stateful services. This paper proposes an approach to deriving service models from service interactions, which enhance the accuracy of response generation by considering service state. This is achieved by uncovering contextual dependencies among interaction messages and analyzing the relationships between message data values. The approach is evaluated using interaction traces collected from both stateful and stateless services, and the results reveal notable enhancements in accuracy and efficiency over existing approaches in service response generation.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[VAPU: System for Autonomous Legacy Code Modernization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18509v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a solution for the modernization of legacy applications, an area of code generation where LLM-based multi-agent systems are proving essential for complex multi-phased tasks. Legacy applications often contain deprecated components that create compatibility, security, and reliability risks, but high resource costs make companies hesitate to update. We take a step forward to integrate an LLM-based multi-agent system as part of a legacy web application update to provide a cost-effective solution to update legacy applications autonomously. We propose a multi-agent system named a Verifying Agent Pipeline Updater (VAPU), which is designed to update code files in phases while simulating different roles in a software development team. In our previous study, we evaluated the system for legacy version updates by using six legacy web application view files by resulting errors and accomplished requirements. This study extends the previous evaluation of a multi-agent pipeline system by extending the evaluation of VAPU from a single LLM to five LLMs and using the temperature parameter in both 0 to 1 settings. Additionally, we tested the system with 20 open-source Python GitHub projects. The results of the evaluation were compared to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning (OSL) prompts. The extended evaluation of VAPU showed that particularly in a low-temperature VAPU can get similar level of error count compared to the ZSL/OSL prompts but with a higher level of fulfilled requirements, depending on the LLM. VAPU showed up to 22.5% increase in the succeeding Python file update requirements compared to ZSL/OSL prompts. The study indicates that an LLM-based multi-agent system is a capable solution to update components of a legacy application autonomously.</p></details> | Table 13, figure 2 |

GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl, including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark, state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15% improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model, Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters, this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community, encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Data-Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00046v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training data, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[CodeRL+: Improving Code Generation via Reinforcement with Execution Semantics Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18471v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models in Thematic Analysis: Prompt Engineering, Evaluation, and Guidelines for Qualitative Software Engineering Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18456v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence advances, large language models (LLMs) are entering qualitative research workflows, yet no reproducible methods exist for integrating them into established approaches like thematic analysis (TA), one of the most common qualitative methods in software engineering research. Moreover, existing studies lack systematic evaluation of LLM-generated qualitative outputs against established quality criteria. We designed and iteratively refined prompts for Phases 2-5 of Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA, then tested outputs from multiple LLMs against codes and themes produced by experienced researchers. Using 15 interviews on software engineers' well-being, we conducted blind evaluations with four expert evaluators who applied rubrics derived directly from Braun and Clarke's quality criteria. Evaluators preferred LLM-generated codes 61% of the time, finding them analytically useful for answering the research question. However, evaluators also identified limitations: LLMs fragmented data unnecessarily, missed latent interpretations, and sometimes produced themes with unclear boundaries. Our contributions are threefold. First, a reproducible approach integrating refined, documented prompts with an evaluation framework to operationalize Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA. Second, an empirical comparison of LLM- and human-generated codes and themes in software engineering data. Third, guidelines for integrating LLMs into qualitative analysis while preserving methodological rigour, clarifying when and how LLMs can assist effectively and when human interpretation remains essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-World Usability of Vulnerability Proof-of-Concepts: A Comprehensive Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18448v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for a vulnerability is crucial in validating its existence, mitigating false positives, and illustrating the severity of the security threat it poses. However, research on PoCs significantly lags behind studies focusing on vulnerability data. This discrepancy can be directly attributed to several challenges, including the dispersion of real-world PoCs across multiple platforms, the diversity in writing styles, and the difficulty associated with PoC reproduction. To fill this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study on PoCs in the wild, assessing their report availability, completeness, reproducibility. Specifically, 1) to investigate PoC reports availability for CVE vulnerability, we collected an extensive dataset of 470,921 PoCs and their reports from 13 platforms, representing the broadest collection of publicly available PoCs to date. 2) To assess the completeness of PoC report at a fine-grained level, we proposed a component extraction method, which combines pattern-matching techniques with a fine-tuned BERT-NER model to extract 9 key components from PoC reports. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of PoCs, we recruited 8 participants to manually reproduce 150 sampled vulnerabilities with 32 vulnerability types based on PoC reports, enabling an in-depth analysis of PoC reproducibility and the factors influencing it. Our findings reveal that 78.9% of CVE vulnerabilities lack available PoCs, and existing PoC reports typically miss about 30% of the essential components required for effective vulnerability understanding and reproduction, with various reasons identified for the failure to reproduce vulnerabilities using available PoC reports. Finally, we proposed actionable strategies for stakeholders to enhance the overall usability of vulnerability PoCs in strengthening software security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human to Document, AI to Code: Three Case Studies of Comparing GenAI for Notebook Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18430v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks have become the preferred tool of choice for data scientists and practitioners to perform analyses and share results. Notebooks uniquely combine scripts with documentation. With the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, it is increasingly important, especially in competitive settings, to distinguish the characteristics of human-written versus GenAI. In this study, we present three case studies to explore potential strengths of both humans and GenAI through the coding and documenting activities in notebooks. We first characterize differences between 25 code and documentation features in human-written, medal-winning Kaggle notebooks. We find that gold medalists are primarily distinguished by longer and more detailed documentation. Second, we analyze the distinctions between human-written and GenAI notebooks. Our results show that while GenAI notebooks tend to achieve higher code quality (as measured by metrics like code smells and technical debt), human-written notebooks display greater structural diversity, complexity, and innovative approaches to problem-solving. Based on these results, we envision the work as groundwork that highlight four agendas to further investigate how GenAI could be utilized in notebooks that maximizes the potential collaboration between human and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Agents go Astray: Course-Correcting SWE Agents with PRMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02360v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex, multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM) that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0% to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as $0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents' reliability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLM-Based Mobile App Recommendations: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18364v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to recommend mobile applications through natural language prompts, offering a flexible alternative to keyword-based app store search. Yet, the reasoning behind these recommendations remains opaque, raising questions about their consistency, explainability, and alignment with traditional App Store Optimization (ASO) metrics. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how widely-used general purpose LLMs generate, justify, and rank mobile app recommendations. Our contributions are: (i) a taxonomy of 16 generalizable ranking criteria elicited from LLM outputs; (ii) a systematic evaluation framework to analyse recommendation consistency and responsiveness to explicit ranking instructions; and (iii) a replication package to support reproducibility and future research on AI-based recommendation systems. Our findings reveal that LLMs rely on a broad yet fragmented set of ranking criteria, only partially aligned with standard ASO metrics. While top-ranked apps tend to be consistent across runs, variability increases with ranking depth and search specificity. LLMs exhibit varying sensitivity to explicit ranking instructions - ranging from substantial adaptations to near-identical outputs - highlighting their complex reasoning dynamics in conversational app discovery. Our results aim to support end-users, app developers, and recommender-systems researchers in navigating the emerging landscape of conversational app discovery.</p></details> | Under review |

While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensuring Robustness in ML-enabled Software Systems: A User Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18292v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring robustness in ML-enabled software systems requires addressing critical challenges, such as silent failures, out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and adversarial attacks. Traditional software engineering practices, which rely on predefined logic, are insufficient for ML components that depend on data and probabilistic decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose the ML-On-Rails protocol, a unified framework designed to enhance the robustness and trustworthiness of ML-enabled systems in production. This protocol integrates key safeguards such as OOD detection, adversarial attack detection, input validation, and explainability. It also includes a model-to-software communication framework using HTTP status codes to enhance transparency in reporting model outcomes and errors. To align our approach with real-world challenges, we conducted a practitioner survey, which revealed major robustness issues, gaps in current solutions, and highlighted how a standardised protocol such as ML-On-Rails can improve system robustness. Our findings highlight the need for more support and resources for engineers working with ML systems. Finally, we outline future directions for refining the proposed protocol, leveraging insights from the survey and real-world applications to continually enhance its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RESCUE: Retrieval Augmented Secure Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18204v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still generate vulnerable code. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security knowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw security-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the significant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code generation with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base construction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize distillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security guidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a hierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base from top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each hierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated RESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure code generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE improves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed in-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness of individual components in RESCUE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Heuristic Guidance Based on Multiple Model Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15181v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning frameworks serve as the foundation for developing and deploying deep learning applications. To enhance the quality of deep learning frameworks, researchers have proposed numerous testing methods using deep learning models as test inputs. However, existing methods predominantly measure model bug detection effectiveness as heuristic indicators, presenting three critical limitations. Firstly, existing methods fail to quantitatively measure model's operator combination variety, potentially missing critical operator combinations that could trigger framework bugs. Secondly, existing methods neglect measuring and heuristically guiding the model execution time, resulting in the omission of numerous models potential for detecting more framework bugs within limited testing time. Thirdly, existing methods overlook correlation between different model measurements, relying simply on single-indicator heuristic guidance without considering their trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DLMMM, the first deep learning framework testing method to include multiple model measurements into heuristic guidance and fuse these measurements to achieve their trade-offs. DLMMM firstly quantitatively measures model's bug detection performance, operator combination variety, and model execution time. After that, DLMMM fuses these measurements based on their correlation to achieve their trade-offs. To further enhance testing effectiveness, DLMMM designs multi-level heuristic guidance for test input model generation. We apply DLMMM to test three widely used deep learning frameworks (including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MindSpore). The experimental results show that DLMMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentChangeBench: A Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework for Goal-Shift Robustness in Conversational AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18170v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions, yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness, Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency. AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$ recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above $80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent resilience in realistic enterprise settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models</p></details> |
| **[Saber: An Efficient Sampling with Adaptive Acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking for Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18165v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4% inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhyFlow: Interrogative Debugger for Sensemaking Taint Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Program Semantics Reasoning with Type Inference in System F](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23686v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM (Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '25, package released at: https://github.com/SecurityLab-UCD/TF-Bench</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Multi-Vocal Empirical Study of ML Cloud Service Misuses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09815v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used across various domains, including medical diagnostics and autonomous driving. To support this growth, cloud providers offer ML services to ease the integration of ML components in software systems. The evolving business requirements and the popularity of ML services have led practitioners of all skill levels to implement, and maintain ML service-based systems. However, they may not always adhere to optimal design and usage practices for ML cloud services, resulting in common misuse which could significantly degrade the quality of ML service-based systems and adversely affect their maintenance and evolution. Though much research has been conducted on ML service misuse, a consistent terminology and specification for these misuses remain absent. We therefore conduct in this paper a comprehensive, multi-vocal empirical study exploring the prevalence of ML cloud service misuses in practice. We propose a catalog of 20 ML cloud service misuses, most of which have not been studied in prior research. To achieve this, we conducted a) a systematic literature review of studies on ML misuses, b) a gray literature review of the official documentation provided by major cloud providers, c) an empirical analysis of a curated set of 377 ML service-based systems on GitHub, and d) a survey with 50 ML practitioners. Our results show that ML service misuses are common in both open-source projects and industry, often stemming from a lack of understanding of service capabilities, and insufficient documentation. This emphasizes the importance of ongoing education in best practices for ML services, which is the focus of this paper, while also highlighting the need for tools to automatically detect and refactor ML misuses.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlueCodeAgent: A Blue Teaming Agent Enabled by Automated Red Teaming for CodeGen AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18131v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation, concerns over the security risks have grown substantially. Early research has primarily focused on red teaming, which aims to uncover and evaluate vulnerabilities and risks of CodeGen models. However, progress on the blue teaming side remains limited, as developing defense requires effective semantic understanding to differentiate the unsafe from the safe. To fill in this gap, we propose BlueCodeAgent, an end-to-end blue teaming agent enabled by automated red teaming. Our framework integrates both sides: red teaming generates diverse risky instances, while the blue teaming agent leverages these to detect previously seen and unseen risk scenarios through constitution and code analysis with agentic integration for multi-level defense. Our evaluation across three representative code-related tasks--bias instruction detection, malicious instruction detection, and vulnerable code detection--shows that BlueCodeAgent achieves significant gains over the base models and safety prompt-based defenses. In particular, for vulnerable code detection tasks, BlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic analysis to effectively reduce false positives, a challenging problem as base models tend to be over-conservative, misclassifying safe code as unsafe. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average 12.7\% F1 score improvement across four datasets in three tasks, attributed to its ability to summarize actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware risk detection. We demonstrate that the red teaming benefits the blue teaming by continuously identifying new vulnerabilities to enhance defense performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Benchmark Dataset And LLMs Comparison For NFR Classification With Explainable AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18096v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) play a critical role in determining the overall quality and user satisfaction of software systems. Accurately identifying and classifying NFRs is essential to ensure that software meets performance, usability, and reliability expectations. However, manual identification of NFRs from documentation is time-consuming and prone to errors, necessitating automated solutions. Before implementing any automated solution, a robust and comprehensive dataset is essential. To build such a dataset, we collected NFRs from various Project Charters and Open Source Software Documentation. This enhanced the technical depth and usability of an already existing NFR dataset. We categorized NFRs into sub-classes and identified needs using widely used Large Language Models to facilitate automation. After classifying the NFRs, we compared the classification results of the selected LLMs: RoBERTa, CodeBERT, Gemma-2, Phi-3, Mistral-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B using various evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and lime scores. Among these models, Gemma-2 achieved the best results with a precision of 0.87, recall of 0.89, and F1-score of 0.88, alongside a lime hit score of 78 out of 80. Phi-3 closely followed with a precision of 0.85, recall of 0.87, F1-score of 0.86, and the highest lime hit score of 79. By improving the contextual foundation, this integration enhanced the model's comprehension of technical aspects and user requirements.</p></details> |  |

We identified a lack of support for problem discovery within AI innovation projects. To address this, we propose and evaluate DIP-AI, a discovery framework tailored to guide early-stage exploration in such initiatives. Based on a literature review, our solution proposal combines elements of ISO 12207, 5338, and Design Thinking to support the discovery of AI innovation projects, aiming at promoting higher quality deliveries and stakeholder satisfaction. We evaluated DIP-AI in an industry-academia collaboration (IAC) case study of an AI innovation project, in which participants applied DIP-AI to the discovery phase in practice and provided their perceptions about the approach's problem discovery capability, acceptance, and suggestions. The results indicate that DIP-AI is relevant and useful, particularly in facilitating problem discovery in AI projects. This research contributes to academia by sharing DIP-AI as a framework for AI problem discovery. For industry, we discuss the use of this framework in a real IAC program that develops AI innovation projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and accepted at SBQS25 - Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality.

Yet few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, potentially due to the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench has 111 curated and reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific out-of-order execution issue. To support reproducibility and ease of use, JunoBench offers a unified execution environment where crashes and fixes can be reliably reproduced. By providing realistic crashes and their resolutions, JunoBench facilitates bug detection, localization, and repair tailored to the interactive and iterative nature of notebook-based ML development.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a taxonomy for LLM test case design, informed by research literature and our experience. Each facet is exemplified, and we conduct an LLM-assisted analysis of six open-source testing frameworks, perform a sensitivity study of an agent-based system across different model configurations, and provide working examples contrasting atomic and aggregated test cases. We identify key variation points that impact test correctness and highlight open challenges that the research, industry, and open-source communities must address as LLMs become integral to software systems. Our taxonomy defines four facets of LLM test case design, addressing ambiguity in both inputs and outputs while establishing best practices. It distinguishes variability in goals, the system under test, and inputs, and introduces two key oracle types: atomic and aggregated. Our findings reveal that current tools treat test executions as isolated events, lack explicit aggregation mechanisms, and inadequately capture variability across model versions, configurations, and repeated runs. This highlights the need for viewing correctness as a distribution of outcomes rather than a binary property, requiring closer collaboration between academia and practitioners to establish mature, variability-aware testing methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Executable Knowledge Graphs for Replicating AI Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17795v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible solution for automated AI research replication.

| **[Self-planning Code Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06689v5)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule solution steps prior to implementation. To this end, we introduce planning into code generation to help the model understand complex intent and reduce the difficulty of problem-solving. This paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach with large language models, which consists of two phases, namely planning phase and implementation phase. Specifically, in the planning phase, LLM outlines concise and formatted planning steps from the intent. Subsequently, in the implementation phase, the model generates code step by step, guided by the preceding planning steps. We conduct extensive experiments on various code-generation benchmarks across multiple programming languages. Experimental results show that self-planning code generation achieves a relative improvement of up to 25.4% in Pass@1 compared to direct code generation, and up to 11.9% compared to Chain-of-Thought code generation. Moreover, our self-planning approach also enhances the quality of the generated code with respect to correctness, readability, and robustness, as assessed by humans.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |

Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |

Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations. We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to improved effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025) as a findings long paper</p></details> |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v5)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.</p></details> |  |

It is a direct bridge between mobile apps and end users, which directly affects the end user's experience. Neglecting GUI quality can undermine the value and effectiveness of the entire mobile app solution. Significant research efforts have been devoted to GUI testing, one effective method to ensure mobile app quality. By conducting rigorous GUI testing, developers can ensure that the visual and interactive elements of the mobile apps not only meet functional requirements but also provide a seamless and user-friendly experience. However, traditional solutions, relying on the source code or layout files, have met challenges in both effectiveness and efficiency due to the gap between what is obtained and what app GUI actually presents. Vision-based mobile app GUI testing approaches emerged with the development of computer vision technologies and have achieved promising progress. In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the state-of-the-art techniques on 271 papers, among which 92 are vision-based studies. This survey covers different topics of GUI testing, like GUI test generation, GUI test record & replay, GUI testing framework, etc. Specifically, the research emphasis of this survey is placed mostly on how vision-based techniques outperform traditional solutions and have gradually taken a vital place in the GUI testing field. Based on the investigation of existing studies, we outline the challenges and opportunities of (vision-based) mobile app GUI testing and propose promising research directions with the combination of emerging techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted by the ACM Computing Surveys in Oct 2025</p></details> |

Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities. However, they generally evaluate the generated code based on static prompts, and tend to fail for complex code scenarios which typically involve multiple requirements and require more contextual information. In addition, these approaches lack fine-grained evaluation for complex code, resulting in limited explainability. To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first agent-based evaluation framework for complex code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Requirement-guided multi-dimensional context distillation stage and (2) Fine-grained scoring and summarization stage. A comprehensive evaluation report is also generated for enhanced explainability. For validation, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 363 samples spanning 37 coding scenarios and 23 programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance among three baselines for evaluating complex code generation, outperforming the best baseline with average improvements of 0.217, 0.163, and 0.141 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://github.com/Eshe0922/CodeVisionary.</p></details> |  |

If not addressed, Japan could potentially lose up to 12 trillion yen per year after 2025, which is 3 times more than the cost in previous years. Asahi also faced the same internal challenges regarding legacy system, where manual maintenance workflows and limited QA environment have left critical systems outdated and difficult to update. Middleware and OS version have remained unchanged for years, leading to now its nearing end of service life which require huge maintenance cost and effort to continue its operation. To address this problem, we have developed and implemented a Scalable CI/CD Pipeline where isolated development environments can be created and deleted dynamically and is scalable as needed. This Scalable CI/CD Pipeline incorporate GitHub for source code control and branching, Jenkins for pipeline automation, Amazon Web Services for scalable environment, and Docker for environment containerization. This paper presents the design and architecture of the Scalable CI/CD Pipeline, with the implementation along with some use cases. Through Scalable CI/CD, developers can freely and safely test maintenance procedures and do experiments with new technology in their own environment, reducing maintenance cost and drive Digital Transformation (DX). key words: 2025 Japan Cliff, Scalable CI/CD, DevOps, Legacy IT Modernization.</p></details> |  |

However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdapTrack: Constrained Decoding without Distorting LLM's Output Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17376v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model-based code generation and completion tools have been widely adopted, but they may sometimes produce code that does not meet necessary constraints, such as syntactic correctness or API existence. Constrained decoding techniques are developed to help the model generate code adhering to the constraints by greedily eliminating generation options that violate constraints at each step of the generation process. However, there is a severe limitation of constrained decoding, that it distorts the model's output intent, forcing it to produce code that may satisfy the constraint but does not match the development intent and is therefore incorrect. In response to this challenge, we propose AdapTrack. By incorporating backtracking into the generation process, AdapTrack avoids distorting the output intent of the model, thereby producing results that are not only constraint-compliant but also more semantically aligned with model's output intent. On our synthetic API completion dataset, AdapTrack can achieve up to 360.87% improvement compared to constrained decoding; on the real-world API completion dataset we collect that exhibits similar issues, AdapTrack can achieve up to 38.93% improvement over constrained decoding; in general code genration benchmarks, compared to constrained decoding, AdapTrack can achieve up to 7.84% improvement on HumanEval, and up to 6.42% improvement on MBPP. This indicates that, simply by better adhering to the model's output intent, AdapTrack can achieve significant improvements. We provide a theoretical proof that the distribution produced by AdapTrack aligns with the model's distribution given the generated tokens, thereby ensuring that the model's output intent is not distorted. Experiments on DSL problems show that, compared to existing methods, our approach can provide generation results that are more consistent with the language model's distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICSE 2026</p></details> |

Retrieval-augmented methods mitigate this by injecting repository context at inference time. The low inference-time latency budget affects either retrieval quality or the added latency adversely impacts user experience. We address this limitation with SpecAgent, an agent that improves both latency and code-generation quality by proactively exploring repository files during indexing and constructing speculative context that anticipates future edits in each file. This indexing-time asynchrony allows thorough context computation, masking latency, and the speculative nature of the context improves code-generation quality. Additionally, we identify the problem of future context leakage in existing benchmarks, which can inflate reported performance. To address this, we construct a synthetic, leakage-free benchmark that enables a more realistic evaluation of our agent against baselines. Experiments show that SpecAgent consistently achieves absolute gains of 9-11% (48-58% relative) compared to the best-performing baselines, while significantly reducing inference latency.</p></details> |  |

We tackle the problem of writing Rocq proofs using a multi-stage agentic system, tailored for formal verification, and demonstrate its high effectiveness. We conduct an ablation study and demonstrate shows that incorporating multi-agent debate during the planning stage increases the proof success rate by 20% overall and nearly doubles it for complex theorems, while the reflection mechanism further enhances stability and consistency.</p></details> |  |

However, their adoption often relies on informal experimentation rather than structured guidance. \textit{Aims:} This study investigates how software testing professionals use LLMs in practice to propose a preliminary, practitioner-informed guideline to support their integration into testing workflows. \textit{Method:} We conducted a qualitative study with 15 software testers from diverse roles and domains. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using grounded theory-based processes focused on thematic analysis. \textit{Results:} Testers described an iterative and reflective process that included defining testing objectives, applying prompt engineering strategies, refining prompts, evaluating outputs, and learning over time. They emphasized the need for human oversight and careful validation, especially due to known limitations of LLMs such as hallucinations and inconsistent reasoning. \textit{Conclusions:} LLM adoption in software testing is growing, but remains shaped by evolving practices and caution around risks. This study offers a starting point for structuring LLM use in testing contexts and invites future research to refine these practices across teams, tools, and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TREAT: A Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation and Testing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17163v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models are fundamentally transforming the software engineering landscape, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks such as code generation, debugging, and testing. Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Performance Tools in Model Reasoning for GPU Kernel Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17158v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models are now prevalent in software engineering with many developers using them to automate tasks and accelerate their development. While language models have been tremendous at accomplishing complex software engineering tasks, there are still many areas where they fail to deliver desirable results, for instance code performance related tasks. Tasks like optimization depend on many complex data from the environment, hardware, etc. that are not directly represented in source code. Recent efforts have seen large improvements in general code modeling tasks using chain-of-thought style reasoning, but these models still fail to comprehend how the environment interacts with code performance. In this paper we propose a methodology to train language models that can interact with performance tools during their reasoning process. We then demonstrate how this methodology can be used to train a state-of-the-art GPU kernel optimization model.</p></details> |  |

However, it does not deal with the application data aspects. As such, developers have to intervene and undergo the burden of managing the application data, often via separate cloud storage services. To further streamline cloud-native application development, in this work, we propose a new paradigm, known as Object as a Service (OaaS) that encapsulates application data and functions into the cloud object abstraction. OaaS relieves developers from resource and data management burden while offering built-in optimization features. Inspired by OOP, OaaS incorporates access modifiers and inheritance into the serverless paradigm that: (a) prevents developers from compromising the system via accidentally accessing underlying data; and (b) enables software reuse in cloud-native application development. Furthermore, OaaS natively supports dataflow semantics. It enables developers to define function workflows while transparently handling data navigation, synchronization, and parallelism issues. To establish the OaaS paradigm, we develop a platform named Oparaca that offers state abstraction for structured and unstructured data with consistency and fault-tolerant guarantees. We evaluated Oparaca under real-world settings against state-of-the-art platforms with respect to the imposed overhead, scalability, and ease of use. The results demonstrate that the object abstraction provided by OaaS can streamline flexible and scalable cloud-native application development with an insignificant overhead on the underlying serverless system.</p></details> |  |

However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor intensive. We present an automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two real-world student code submission datasets in different programming languages.We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has proposed various methods to enhance models' CoT reasoning for code generation such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning. However, existing approaches still face three critical limitations: (1) limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths, which constrains generalization across various programming scenarios, (2) lack of quality assessment for intermediate reasoning steps, which hampers the reliability of the generated plans and code, and (3) the potential negative impact of "overthinking", potentially leading to unnecessarily complex and incorrect solutions. To address these limitations, we frame CoT code generation as a decision making problem and present SEER, a SElf-Exploring deep Reasoning framework that enables accurate and adaptive reasoning for code generation. SEER introduces three key components: (1) Diverse reasoning path exploration, which aims at exploring diverse reasoning paths and annotating intermediate steps without relying on manual experts or closed-source proprietary models; (2) Reasoning quality-aware model training, which trains a policy model for generating candidate reasoning steps and a value model for assessing their quality; and (3) Adaptive CoT reasoning, which dynamically switches between direct generation and step-by-step reasoning for different problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was completed in Feb. 2025, submitted to ICSE 2026 in Mar. 2025, received a major revision in Jun. 2025, and was finally accepted in Oct. 2025</p></details> |

Investigating the potential of generative AIs in usability inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17056v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Usability inspection is a well-established technique for identifying interaction issues in software interfaces, thereby contributing to improved product quality. However, it is a costly process that requires time and specialized knowledge from inspectors. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), new opportunities have emerged to support this task, particularly through generative models capable of interpreting interfaces and performing inspections more efficiently. This study examines the performance of generative AIs in identifying usability problems, comparing them to those of experienced human inspectors. A software prototype was evaluated by four specialists and two AI models (GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash), using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. While inspectors achieved the highest levels of precision and overall coverage, the AIs demonstrated high individual performance and discovered many novel defects, but with a higher rate of false positives and redundant reports. The combination of AIs and human inspectors produced the best results, revealing their complementarity. These findings suggest that AI, in its current stage, cannot replace human inspectors but can serve as a valuable augmentation tool to improve efficiency and expand defect coverage. The results provide evidence based on quantitative analysis to inform the discussion on the role of AI in usability inspections, pointing to viable paths for its complementary use in software quality assessment contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and to be published in SBQS25 - Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality 2025</p></details> |

To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes and validates a synergistic framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven data augmentation with an advanced encoder. We first demonstrate that data augmentation, optimized through a systematic evaluation of bi-directional and zero/few-shot prompting strategies, is highly effective, while the choice among leading LLMs is not a significant performance factor. Building on the augmented data, we further enhance an established, state-of-the-art pre-trained language model based method by incorporating an encoder distinguished by a broader pre-training corpus and an extended context window. Our experiments on four public datasets quantify the distinct contributions of our framework's components: on its own, data augmentation consistently improves the baseline method, providing substantial performance gains of up to 26.66%; incorporating the advanced encoder provides an additional lift of 2.21% to 11.25%. This synergy culminates in a fully optimized framework with maximum gains of up to 28.59% on $F_1$ score and 28.9% on $F_2$ score over the established baseline, decisively outperforming ten established baselines from three dominant paradigms. This work contributes a pragmatic and scalable methodology to overcome the data scarcity bottleneck, paving the way for broader industrial adoption of data-driven requirement-to-code traceability.</p></details> |  |

Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages, and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.</p></details> | 8 pages, two columns |
| **[When AI Takes the Wheel: Security Analysis of Framework-Constrained Program Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16823v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the AI wave has grown rapidly in software development. Even novice developers can now design and generate complex framework-constrained software systems based on their high-level requirements with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when LLMs gradually "take the wheel" of software development, developers may only check whether the program works. They often miss security problems hidden in how the generated programs are implemented. In this work, we investigate the security properties of framework-constrained programs generated by state-of-the-art LLMs. We focus specifically on Chrome extensions due to their complex security model involving multiple privilege boundaries and isolated components. To achieve this, we built ChromeSecBench, a dataset with 140 prompts based on known vulnerable extensions. We used these prompts to instruct nine state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete Chrome extensions, and then analyzed them for vulnerabilities across three dimensions: scenario types, model differences, and vulnerability categories. Our results show that LLMs produced vulnerable programs at alarmingly high rates (18%-50%), particularly in Authentication & Identity and Cookie Management scenarios (up to 83% and 78% respectively). Most vulnerabilities exposed sensitive browser data like cookies, history, or bookmarks to untrusted code. Interestingly, we found that advanced reasoning models performed worse, generating more vulnerabilities than simpler models. These findings highlight a critical gap between LLMs' coding skills and their ability to write secure framework-constrained programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decompile-Bench: Million-Scale Binary-Source Function Pairs for Real-World Binary Decompilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12668v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LLM-based decompilers have been shown effective to convert low-level binaries into human-readable source code. However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLM decompilation technology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Decompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmark Decompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues. We further explore commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide a thorough assessment of the studied LLM decompilers and find that fine-tuning with Decompile-Bench causes a 20% improvement over previous benchmarks in terms of the re-executability rate. Our code and data has been released in HuggingFace and Github. https://github.com/albertan017/LLM4Decompile</p></details> |  |

We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[More with Less: An Empirical Study of Turn-Control Strategies for Efficient Coding Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16786v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-powered coding agents, which operate in iterative loops (turns) to solve software engineering tasks, are becoming increasingly powerful. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This challenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token counts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns required for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient or unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing individual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an underexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three state-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control strategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a novel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings first reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no single model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show that a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline, serves as a "sweet spot", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with minimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy consistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better solve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by intelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work provides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering simple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We demonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement approach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents.</p></details> |  |

The intricate nature of the process makes it labor-intensive, time-consuming and expert-knowledge-dependent to build a large number of executable code repositories, limiting the scalability of existing work based on running tests. The primary bottleneck lies in the automated building of test environments for different repositories, which is an essential yet underexplored task. To mitigate the gap, we introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent aiming at automating the building of executable test environments for any repositories at scale. Specifically, given a code repository, Repo2Run iteratively builds the Docker image, runs unit tests based on the feedback of the building, and synthesizes the Dockerfile until the entire pipeline is executed successfully. The resulting Dockerfile can then be used to create Docker container environments for running code and tests. We created a benchmark containing 420 Python repositories with unit tests for evaluation. The results illustrate that Repo2Run achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming SWE-agent by 77.0%. The resources of Repo2Run are available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents QuanBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on quantum code generation. QuanBench includes 44 programming tasks that cover quantum algorithms, state preparation, gate decomposition, and quantum machine learning. Each task has an executable canonical solution and is evaluated by functional correctness (Pass@K) and quantum semantic equivalence (Process Fidelity). We evaluate several recent LLMs, including general-purpose and code-specialized models. The results show that current LLMs have limited capability in generating the correct quantum code, with overall accuracy below 40% and frequent semantic errors. We also analyze common failure cases, such as outdated API usage, circuit construction errors, and incorrect algorithm logic. QuanBench provides a basis for future work on improving quantum code generation with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by ASE2025</p></details> |

However, systematic analysis of these agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18439v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable. This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.

Quantum program testing has emerged as a prominent research area within the scope of quantum software engineering. While numerous approaches have been proposed to address quantum program quality assurance, our analysis reveals that most existing methods rely on measurement-based validation in practice. However, due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum programs, measurement-based validation methods face significant limitations. To investigate these limitations, we conducted an empirical study of recent research on quantum program testing, analyzing measurement-based validation methods in the literature. Our analysis categorizes existing measurement-based validation methods into two groups: distribution-level validation and output-value-level validation. We then compare measurement-based validation with statevector-based validation methods to evaluate their pros and cons. Our findings demonstrate that measurement-based validation is suitable for straightforward assessments, such as verifying the existence of specific output values, while statevector-based validation proves more effective for complicated tasks such as assessing the program behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be appeared in the proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025), NIER track, Seoul, South Korea, November 16 -20, 2025</p></details> |

As programmers lean more heavily on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants to develop code solutions, it is becoming increasingly important for programmers to comprehend GenAI solutions so that they can verify their appropriateness and properly integrate them into existing code. At the same time, GenAI tools are increasingly being enlisted to provide programmers with tailored explanations of code written both by GenAI and humans. Thus, in computing education, GenAI presents new challenges and opportunities for learners who are trying to comprehend computer programs. To provide computing educators with evidence-based guidance on the use of GenAI to facilitate code comprehension and to identify directions for future research, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of state-of-the-art approaches and tools that leverage GenAI to enhance code comprehension. Our SLR focuses on 31 studies published between 2022 and 2024. Despite their potential, GenAI assistants often yield inaccurate or unclear explanations, and novice programmers frequently struggle to craft effective prompts, thereby impeding their ability to leverage GenAI to aid code comprehension. Our review classifies GenAI-based approaches and tools, identifies methods used to study them, and summarizes the empirical evaluations of their effectiveness. We consider the implications of our findings for computing education research and practice, and identify directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrasting the Hyperparameter Tuning Impact Across Software Defect Prediction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16665v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software defect prediction (SDP) is crucial for delivering high-quality software products. Recent research has indicated that prediction performance improvements in SDP are achievable by applying hyperparameter tuning to a particular SDP scenario. However, the positive impact resulting from the hyperparameter tuning step may differ based on the targeted SDP scenario. Comparing the impact of hyperparameter tuning across SDP scenarios is necessary to provide comprehensive insights and enhance the robustness, generalizability, and, eventually, the practicality of SDP modeling for quality assurance. Therefore, in this study, we contrast the impact of hyperparameter tuning across two pivotal and consecutive SDP scenarios: (1) Inner Version Defect Prediction (IVDP) and (2) Cross Version Defect Prediction (CVDP). The main distinctions between the two scenarios lie in the scope of defect prediction and the selected evaluation setups. This study's experiments use common evaluation setups, 28 machine learning (ML) algorithms, 53 post-release software datasets, two tuning algorithms, and five optimization metrics. We apply statistical analytics to compare the SDP performance impact differences by investigating the overall impact, the single ML algorithm impact, and variations across different software dataset sizes. The results indicate that the SDP gains within the IVDP scenario are significantly larger than those within the CVDP scenario. The results reveal that asserting performance gains for up to 24 out of 28 ML algorithms may not hold across multiple SDP scenarios. Furthermore, we found that small software datasets are more susceptible to larger differences in performance impacts. Overall, the study findings recommend software engineering researchers and practitioners to consider the effect of the selected SDP scenario when expecting performance gains from hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

We introduce TritonRL, a domain-specialized LLM for Triton kernel generation, trained with a novel training framework that enables robust and automated kernel synthesis. Unlike general-purpose programming languages, Triton kernel generation faces unique challenges due to data scarcity and incomplete evaluation criteria, vulnerable to reward hacking. Our approach addresses these challenges end-to-end by distilling Triton-specific knowledge through supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets, and further improving code quality via reinforcement learning (RL) with robust, verifiable rewards and hierarchical reward assignment. Our RL framework robustly detects reward hacking and guides both reasoning traces and code tokens through fine-grained verification and hierarchical reward decomposition, enabling the model to generate high-quality Triton kernels that can truly replace existing modules. With robust and fine-grained evaluation, our experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that TritonRL achieves state-of-the-art correctness and speedup, surpassing all other Triton-specific models and underscoring the effectiveness of our RL-based training paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Surface Similarity: Evaluating LLM-Based Test Refactorings with Structural and Semantic Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06767v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to refactor unit tests, improving readability and structure while preserving behavior. Evaluating such refactorings, however, remains difficult: metrics like CodeBLEU penalize beneficial renamings and edits, while semantic similarities overlook readability and modularity. We propose CTSES, a first step toward human-aligned evaluation of refactored tests. CTSES combines CodeBLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L into a composite score that balances semantics, lexical clarity, and structural alignment. Evaluated on 5,000+ refactorings from Defects4J and SF110 (GPT-4o and Mistral-Large), CTSES reduces false negatives and provides more interpretable signals than individual metrics. Our emerging results illustrate that CTSES offers a proof-of-concept for composite approaches, showing their promise in bridging automated metrics and developer judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Aligned Code Readability Assessment with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16579v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code readability is crucial for software comprehension and maintenance, yet difficult to assess at scale. Traditional static metrics often fail to capture the subjective, context-sensitive nature of human judgments. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative, but their behavior as readability evaluators remains underexplored. We introduce CoReEval, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLM-based code readability assessment, comprising over 1.4 million model-snippet-prompt evaluations across 10 state of the art LLMs. The benchmark spans 3 programming languages (Java, Python, CUDA), 2 code types (functional code and unit tests), 4 prompting strategies (ZSL, FSL, CoT, ToT), 9 decoding settings, and developer-guided prompts tailored to junior and senior personas. We compare LLM outputs against human annotations and a validated static model, analyzing numerical alignment (MAE, Pearson's, Spearman's) and justification quality (sentiment, aspect coverage, semantic clustering). Our findings show that developer-guided prompting grounded in human-defined readability dimensions improves alignment in structured contexts, enhances explanation quality, and enables lightweight personalization through persona framing. However, increased score variability highlights trade-offs between alignment, stability, and interpretability. CoReEval provides a robust foundation for prompt engineering, model alignment studies, and human in the loop evaluation, with applications in education, onboarding, and CI/CD pipelines where LLMs can serve as explainable, adaptable reviewers.</p></details> |  |

Objective: This paper proposes and empirically applies a causal model to help educators scaffold responsible GenAI use in Software Engineering (SE) education. The model identifies how professor actions, student factors, and GenAI tool characteristics influence students' usage of GenAI tools. Method: Using a design-based research approach, we applied the model in two contexts: (1) revising four extensive lab assignments of a final-year Software Testing course at Queen's University Belfast (QUB), and (2) embedding GenAI-related competencies into the curriculum of a newly developed SE BSc program at Azerbaijan Technical University (AzTU). Interventions included GenAI usage declarations, output validation tasks, peer-review of AI artifacts, and career-relevant messaging. Results: TBD Conclusions: TBD</p></details> |  |

However, applying them to a stage that is unevenly reported and variably conducted carries important risks: misuse can amplify existing weaknesses and erode confidence in the SR findings. To examine the challenges of using LLMs for QS, we conducted a collaborative autoethnography involving two trials. We evaluated each trial for methodological rigor and practical usefulness, and interpreted the results through a technical lens informed by how LLMs are built and their current limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Declarative Techniques for NL Queries over Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16470v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions in natural language, the answers to which require assembling information from diverse structured data sources. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), applications can now translate natural language questions into a set of API calls or database calls, execute them, and combine the results into an appropriate natural language response. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they do not cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this work, we simulate the heterogeneity of real industry settings by introducing two extensions of the popular Spider benchmark dataset that require a combination of database and API calls. Then, we introduce a declarative approach to handling such data heterogeneity and demonstrate that it copes with data source heterogeneity significantly better than state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic or imperative code generation systems. Our augmented benchmarks are available to the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Empirical Analysis of Continuous Fuzzing: Insights from 1 Million Fuzzing Sessions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16433v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities are constantly being reported and exploited in software products, causing significant impacts on society. In recent years, the main approach to vulnerability detection, fuzzing, has been integrated into the continuous integration process to run in short and frequent cycles. This continuous fuzzing allows for fast identification and remediation of vulnerabilities during the development process. Despite adoption by thousands of projects, however, it is unclear how continuous fuzzing contributes to vulnerability detection. This study aims to elucidate the role of continuous fuzzing in vulnerability detection. Specifically, we investigate the coverage and the total number of fuzzing sessions when fuzzing bugs are discovered. We collect issue reports, coverage reports, and fuzzing logs from OSS-Fuzz, an online service provided by Google that performs fuzzing during continuous integration. Through an empirical study of a total of approximately 1.12 million fuzzing sessions from 878 projects participating in OSS-Fuzz, we reveal that (i) a substantial number of fuzzing bugs exist prior to the integration of continuous fuzzing, leading to a high detection rate in the early stages; (ii) code coverage continues to increase as continuous fuzzing progresses; and (iii) changes in coverage contribute to the detection of fuzzing bugs. This study provides empirical insights into how continuous fuzzing contributes to fuzzing bug detection, offering practical implications for future strategies and tool development in continuous fuzzing.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Have LLMs Come Toward Automated SATD Taxonomy Construction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09601v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technical debt refers to suboptimal code that degrades software quality. When developers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its categories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing such taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding code, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to annotator subjectivity. In this study, we investigate to what extent large language models (LLMs) can generate SATD taxonomies. We designed a structured, LLM-driven pipeline that mirrors the taxonomy construction steps researchers typically follow. We evaluated it on SATD datasets from three domains: quantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully recovered domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer Configuration in machine learning. It also completed taxonomy generation in under two hours and for less than $1, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that, while full automation remains challenging, LLMs can support semi-automated SATD taxonomy construction. Furthermore, our work opens up avenues for future work, such as automated taxonomy generation in other areas.</p></details> | 5 pages, APSEC 2025 |

As part of HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming. Our code and dataset are also public available(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

However, enterprise software development is largely driven by incremental evolution, where challenges extend far beyond routine coding and depend critically on tacit knowledge, including design decisions at different levels and historical trade-offs. To achieve effective AI-powered support for complex software development, we should align emerging AI capabilities with the practical realities of enterprise development. To this end, we systematically identify challenges from both software and LLM perspectives. Alongside these challenges, we outline opportunities where AI and structured knowledge frameworks can enhance decision-making in tasks such as issue localization and impact analysis. To address these needs, we propose the Code Digital Twin, a living framework that models both the physical and conceptual layers of software, preserves tacit knowledge, and co-evolves with the codebase. By integrating hybrid knowledge representations, multi-stage extraction pipelines, incremental updates, LLM-empowered applications, and human-in-the-loop feedback, the Code Digital Twin transforms fragmented knowledge into explicit and actionable representations. Our vision positions it as a bridge between AI advancements and enterprise software realities, providing a concrete roadmap toward sustainable, intelligent, and resilient development and evolution of ultra-complex systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model, DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each (source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally, EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into agent-based frameworks.

While developers increasingly rely on automated testing tools, creating and maintaining acceptance test artifacts still demands significant manual effort. To help tackle this issue, we introduce AToMIC, an automated framework leveraging specialized Large Language Models to generate Gherkin scenarios, Page Objects, and executable UI test scripts directly from requirements (JIRA tickets) and recent code changes. Applied to BMW's MyBMW app, covering 13 real-world issues in a 170+ screen codebase, AToMIC produced executable test artifacts in under five minutes per feature on standard hardware. The generated artifacts were of high quality: 93.3% of Gherkin scenarios were syntactically correct upon generation, 78.8% of PageObjects ran without manual edits, and 100% of generated UI tests executed successfully. In a survey, all practitioners reported time savings (often a full developer-day per feature) and strong confidence in adopting the approach. These results confirm AToMIC as a scalable, practical solution for streamlining acceptance test creation and maintenance in industrial mobile projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Interdependence and Complementarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18802v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition where actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture it. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications achieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions provide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing methods struggle to turn noisy, ambiguous feedback into interpretable insights. [Question/problem.] Syntactic approaches lack semantic depth, while large language models (LLMs) often miss fine-grained features or fail to structure them coherently. In addition, existing methods output flat lists of features without semantic organization, limiting interpretation and comparability. Consequently, current feature extraction approaches do not provide structured, meaningful representations of app features. As a result, practitioners face fragmented information that hinder requirement analysis, prioritization, and cross-app comparison, among other use cases. [Principal ideas/results.] In this context, we propose FeClustRE, a framework integrating hybrid feature extraction, hierarchical clustering with auto-tuning and LLM-based semantic labelling. FeClustRE combines syntactic parsing with LLM enrichment, organizes features into clusters, and automatically generates meaningful taxonomy labels. We evaluate FeClustRE on public benchmarks for extraction correctness and on a sample study of generative AI assistant app reviews for clustering quality, semantic coherence, and interpretability. [Contribution.] Overall, FeClustRE delivers (1) a hybrid framework for feature extraction and taxonomy generation, (2) an auto-tuning mechanism with a comprehensive evaluation methodology, and (3) open-source and replicable implementation. These contributions bridge user feedback and feature understanding, enabling deeper insights into current and emerging requirements.</p></details> | Under review |

However, in Requirements Engineering (RE), data scarcity remains a persistent limitation reported in surveys and mapping studies. [Question/Problem] Although there are multiple datasets supporting LLM-based RE tasks (LLM4RE), they are fragmented and poorly characterized, limiting reuse and comparability. This research addresses the limited visibility and characterization of datasets used in LLM4RE. We investigate which public datasets are employed, how they can be systematically characterized, and which RE tasks and dataset descriptors remain under-represented. [Ideas/Results] To address this, we conduct a systematic mapping study to identify and analyse datasets used in LLM4RE research. A total of 62 publicly available datasets are referenced across 43 primary studies. Each dataset is characterized along descriptors such as artifact type, granularity, RE stage, task, domain, and language. Preliminary findings show multiple research gaps, including limited coverage for elicitation tasks, scarce datasets for management activities beyond traceability, and limited multilingual availability. [Contribution] This research preview offers a public catalogue and structured characterization scheme to support dataset selection, comparison, and reuse in LLM4RE research. Future work will extend the scope to grey literature, as well as integration with open dataset and benchmark repositories.</p></details> | Under review |

However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

| **[Evaluating Large Language Models in detecting Secrets in Android Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18601v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile apps often embed authentication secrets, such as API keys, tokens, and client IDs, to integrate with cloud services. However, developers often hardcode these credentials into Android apps, exposing them to extraction through reverse engineering. Once compromised, adversaries can exploit secrets to access sensitive data, manipulate resources, or abuse APIs, resulting in significant security and financial risks. Existing detection approaches, such as regex-based analysis, static analysis, and machine learning, are effective for identifying known patterns but are fundamentally limited: they require prior knowledge of credential structures, API signatures, or training data. In this paper, we propose SecretLoc, an LLM-based approach for detecting hardcoded secrets in Android apps. SecretLoc goes beyond pattern matching; it leverages contextual and structural cues to identify secrets without relying on predefined patterns or labeled training sets. Using a benchmark dataset from the literature, we demonstrate that SecretLoc detects secrets missed by regex-, static-, and ML-based methods, including previously unseen types of secrets. In total, we discovered 4828 secrets that were undetected by existing approaches, discovering more than 10 "new" types of secrets, such as OpenAI API keys, GitHub Access Tokens, RSA private keys, and JWT tokens, and more. We further extend our analysis to newly crawled apps from Google Play, where we uncovered and responsibly disclosed additional hardcoded secrets. Across a set of 5000 apps, we detected secrets in 2124 apps (42.5%), several of which were confirmed and remediated by developers after we contacted them. Our results reveal a dual-use risk: if analysts can uncover these secrets with LLMs, so can attackers. This underscores the urgent need for proactive secret management and stronger mitigation practices across the mobile ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

However, its reliability in open-ended tasks with dynamic environments and complex interactions remains unexplored. To bridge the gap, we introduce WebDevJudge, a systematic benchmark for assessing LLM-as-a-judge performance in web development, with support for both non-interactive evaluation based on static observations and continuous interactive evaluation with a dynamic web environment. WebDevJudge comprises human preference labels over paired web implementations, annotated with structured and query-grounded rubrics to ensure high-quality ground truth. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate various evaluators, including LLMs, MLLMs, and agentic workflows. We systematically investigate the impact of different paradigms and guidance mechanisms. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between LLM judges and human experts. In-depth analysis indicates this gap stems from fundamental model limitations, including failures in recognizing functional equivalence, verifying task feasibility, and mitigating bias. Overall, WebDevJudge presents a significant challenge to LLM-as-a-judge, offering insights to guide future research toward developing more reliable and capable automated evaluators for complicated scenarios.

| **[PEACE: Towards Efficient Project-Level Efficiency Optimization via Hybrid Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17142v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capability in code generation, but their potential in code efficiency optimization remains underexplored. Previous LLM-based code efficiency optimization approaches exclusively focus on function-level optimization and overlook interaction between functions, failing to generalize to real-world development scenarios. Code editing techniques show great potential for conducting project-level optimization, yet they face challenges associated with invalid edits and suboptimal internal functions. To address these gaps, we propose Peace, a novel hybrid framework for Project-level code Efficiency optimization through Automatic Code Editing, which also ensures the overall correctness and integrity of the project. Peace integrates three key phases: dependency-aware optimizing function sequence construction, valid associated edits identification, and efficiency optimization editing iteration. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of Peace, we construct PeacExec, the first benchmark comprising 146 real-world optimization tasks from 47 high-impact GitHub Python projects, along with highly qualified test cases and executable environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate Peace's superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 69.2% correctness rate (pass@1), +46.9% opt rate, and 0.840 speedup in execution efficiency. Notably, our Peace outperforms all baselines by significant margins, particularly in complex optimization tasks with multiple functions. Moreover, extensive experiments are also conducted to validate the contributions of each component in Peace, as well as the rationale and effectiveness of our hybrid framework design.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAPU: System for Autonomous Legacy Code Modernization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18509v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a solution for the modernization of legacy applications, an area of code generation where LLM-based multi-agent systems are proving essential for complex multi-phased tasks. Legacy applications often contain deprecated components that create compatibility, security, and reliability risks, but high resource costs make companies hesitate to update. We take a step forward to integrate an LLM-based multi-agent system as part of a legacy web application update to provide a cost-effective solution to update legacy applications autonomously. We propose a multi-agent system named a Verifying Agent Pipeline Updater (VAPU), which is designed to update code files in phases while simulating different roles in a software development team. In our previous study, we evaluated the system for legacy version updates by using six legacy web application view files by resulting errors and accomplished requirements. This study extends the previous evaluation of a multi-agent pipeline system by extending the evaluation of VAPU from a single LLM to five LLMs and using the temperature parameter in both 0 to 1 settings. Additionally, we tested the system with 20 open-source Python GitHub projects. The results of the evaluation were compared to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning (OSL) prompts. The extended evaluation of VAPU showed that particularly in a low-temperature VAPU can get similar level of error count compared to the ZSL/OSL prompts but with a higher level of fulfilled requirements, depending on the LLM. VAPU showed up to 22.5% increase in the succeeding Python file update requirements compared to ZSL/OSL prompts. The study indicates that an LLM-based multi-agent system is a capable solution to update components of a legacy application autonomously.</p></details> | Table 13, figure 2 |
| **[Exploring Data-Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00046v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training data, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[CodeRL+: Improving Code Generation via Reinforcement with Execution Semantics Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18471v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models in Thematic Analysis: Prompt Engineering, Evaluation, and Guidelines for Qualitative Software Engineering Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18456v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence advances, large language models (LLMs) are entering qualitative research workflows, yet no reproducible methods exist for integrating them into established approaches like thematic analysis (TA), one of the most common qualitative methods in software engineering research. Moreover, existing studies lack systematic evaluation of LLM-generated qualitative outputs against established quality criteria. We designed and iteratively refined prompts for Phases 2-5 of Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA, then tested outputs from multiple LLMs against codes and themes produced by experienced researchers. Using 15 interviews on software engineers' well-being, we conducted blind evaluations with four expert evaluators who applied rubrics derived directly from Braun and Clarke's quality criteria. Evaluators preferred LLM-generated codes 61% of the time, finding them analytically useful for answering the research question. However, evaluators also identified limitations: LLMs fragmented data unnecessarily, missed latent interpretations, and sometimes produced themes with unclear boundaries. Our contributions are threefold. First, a reproducible approach integrating refined, documented prompts with an evaluation framework to operationalize Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA. Second, an empirical comparison of LLM- and human-generated codes and themes in software engineering data. Third, guidelines for integrating LLMs into qualitative analysis while preserving methodological rigour, clarifying when and how LLMs can assist effectively and when human interpretation remains essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Agents go Astray: Course-Correcting SWE Agents with PRMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02360v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex, multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM) that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0% to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as $0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents' reliability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLM-Based Mobile App Recommendations: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18364v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to recommend mobile applications through natural language prompts, offering a flexible alternative to keyword-based app store search. Yet, the reasoning behind these recommendations remains opaque, raising questions about their consistency, explainability, and alignment with traditional App Store Optimization (ASO) metrics. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how widely-used general purpose LLMs generate, justify, and rank mobile app recommendations. Our contributions are: (i) a taxonomy of 16 generalizable ranking criteria elicited from LLM outputs; (ii) a systematic evaluation framework to analyse recommendation consistency and responsiveness to explicit ranking instructions; and (iii) a replication package to support reproducibility and future research on AI-based recommendation systems. Our findings reveal that LLMs rely on a broad yet fragmented set of ranking criteria, only partially aligned with standard ASO metrics. While top-ranked apps tend to be consistent across runs, variability increases with ranking depth and search specificity. LLMs exhibit varying sensitivity to explicit ranking instructions - ranging from substantial adaptations to near-identical outputs - highlighting their complex reasoning dynamics in conversational app discovery. Our results aim to support end-users, app developers, and recommender-systems researchers in navigating the emerging landscape of conversational app discovery.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[InspectCoder: Dynamic Analysis-Enabled Self Repair through interactive LLM-Debugger Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18327v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model, DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each (source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally, EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into agent-based frameworks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/EffiReasonTrans.</p></details> |  |

While developers increasingly rely on automated testing tools, creating and maintaining acceptance test artifacts still demands significant manual effort. To help tackle this issue, we introduce AToMIC, an automated framework leveraging specialized Large Language Models to generate Gherkin scenarios, Page Objects, and executable UI test scripts directly from requirements (JIRA tickets) and recent code changes. Applied to BMW's MyBMW app, covering 13 real-world issues in a 170+ screen codebase, AToMIC produced executable test artifacts in under five minutes per feature on standard hardware. The generated artifacts were of high quality: 93.3% of Gherkin scenarios were syntactically correct upon generation, 78.8% of PageObjects ran without manual edits, and 100% of generated UI tests executed successfully. In a survey, all practitioners reported time savings (often a full developer-day per feature) and strong confidence in adopting the approach. These results confirm AToMIC as a scalable, practical solution for streamlining acceptance test creation and maintenance in industrial mobile projects.</p></details> |  |

While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications achieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions provide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing methods struggle to turn noisy, ambiguous feedback into interpretable insights. [Question/problem.] Syntactic approaches lack semantic depth, while large language models (LLMs) often miss fine-grained features or fail to structure them coherently. In addition, existing methods output flat lists of features without semantic organization, limiting interpretation and comparability. Consequently, current feature extraction approaches do not provide structured, meaningful representations of app features. As a result, practitioners face fragmented information that hinder requirement analysis, prioritization, and cross-app comparison, among other use cases. [Principal ideas/results.] In this context, we propose FeClustRE, a framework integrating hybrid feature extraction, hierarchical clustering with auto-tuning and LLM-based semantic labelling. FeClustRE combines syntactic parsing with LLM enrichment, organizes features into clusters, and automatically generates meaningful taxonomy labels. We evaluate FeClustRE on public benchmarks for extraction correctness and on a sample study of generative AI assistant app reviews for clustering quality, semantic coherence, and interpretability. [Contribution.] Overall, FeClustRE delivers (1) a hybrid framework for feature extraction and taxonomy generation, (2) an auto-tuning mechanism with a comprehensive evaluation methodology, and (3) open-source and replicable implementation. These contributions bridge user feedback and feature understanding, enabling deeper insights into current and emerging requirements.</p></details> | Under review |

Characterizing Datasets for LLM-based Requirements Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18787v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[Context] Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on domain-specific datasets to achieve robust performance across training and inference stages. However, in Requirements Engineering (RE), data scarcity remains a persistent limitation reported in surveys and mapping studies. [Question/Problem] Although there are multiple datasets supporting LLM-based RE tasks (LLM4RE), they are fragmented and poorly characterized, limiting reuse and comparability. This research addresses the limited visibility and characterization of datasets used in LLM4RE. We investigate which public datasets are employed, how they can be systematically characterized, and which RE tasks and dataset descriptors remain under-represented. [Ideas/Results] To address this, we conduct a systematic mapping study to identify and analyse datasets used in LLM4RE research. A total of 62 publicly available datasets are referenced across 43 primary studies. Each dataset is characterized along descriptors such as artifact type, granularity, RE stage, task, domain, and language. Preliminary findings show multiple research gaps, including limited coverage for elicitation tasks, scarce datasets for management activities beyond traceability, and limited multilingual availability. [Contribution] This research preview offers a public catalogue and structured characterization scheme to support dataset selection, comparison, and reuse in LLM4RE research. Future work will extend the scope to grey literature, as well as integration with open dataset and benchmark repositories.</p></details> | Under review |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Causally Perturbed Fairness Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18719v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features (e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in engineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key challenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an intractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing on designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about data characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting their full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT. Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most directly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive counterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a causal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide a test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves as a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators. Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation, CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more efficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all cases.</p></details> | accepted by TOSEM |

One way to catch regressions before they reach production is executing performance tests before deployment, e.g., using microbenchmarks, which measure performance at subroutine level. In projects with many microbenchmarks, this may take several hours due to repeated execution to get accurate results, disqualifying them from frequent use in CI/CD pipelines. We propose $\mu$OpTime, a static approach to reduce the execution time of microbenchmark suites by configuring the number of repetitions for each microbenchmark. Based on the results of a full, previous microbenchmark suite run, $\mu$OpTime determines the minimal number of (measurement) repetitions with statistical stability metrics that still lead to accurate results. We evaluate $\mu$OpTime with an experimental study on 14 open-source projects written in two programming languages and five stability metrics. Our results show that (i) $\mu$OpTime reduces the total suite execution time (measurement phase) by up to 95.83% (Go) and 94.17% (Java), (ii) the choice of stability metric depends on the project and programming language, (iii) microbenchmark warmup phases have to be considered for Java projects (potentially leading to higher reductions), and (iv) $\mu$OpTime can be used to reliably detect performance regressions in CI/CD pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

The domain of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is no exception, as raw data typically consists of large amounts of time-series data logging the system's status in regular time intervals. Such data has to be sanity checked and preprocessed to be consumable by data-centric workflows. We introduce CPSLint, a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide data preparation for industrial CPS. We build up on the fact that many raw data collections in the CPS domain require similar actions to render them suitable for Machine-Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) workflows, yet still vary enough to hope for one universally applicable solution. CPSLint's main features include type checking and enforcing constraints through validation and remediation for data columns, such as imputing missing data from surrounding rows. More advanced features cover inference of extra CPS-specific data structures, both column-wise and row-wise. For instance, as row-wise structures, descriptive execution phases are an effective method of data compartmentalisation are extracted and prepared for ML-assisted FDI workflows. We demonstrate CPSLint's features through a proof of concept implementation.</p></details> |  |

Frequent benchmarking is essential for identifying these regressions and maintaining service-level agreements (SLAs). Performance benchmarks, however, are resource-intensive and time-consuming, which is a major challenge for integration into Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Although numerous benchmark optimization techniques have been proposed to accelerate benchmark execution, there is currently no practical system that integrates these optimizations seamlessly into real-world CI/CD pipelines. In this vision paper, we argue that the field of benchmark optimization remains under-explored in key areas that hinder its broader adoption. We identify three central challenges to enabling frequent and efficient benchmarking: (a) the composability of benchmark optimization strategies, (b) automated evaluation of benchmarking results, and (c) the usability and complexity of applying these strategies as part of CI/CD systems in practice. We also introduce a conceptual cloud-based benchmarking framework handling these challenges transparently. By presenting these open problems, we aim to stimulate research toward making performance regression detection in CI/CD systems more practical and effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)</p></details> |

In addition, existing methods output flat lists of features without semantic organization, limiting interpretation and comparability. Consequently, current feature extraction approaches do not provide structured, meaningful representations of app features. As a result, practitioners face fragmented information that hinder requirement analysis, prioritization, and cross-app comparison, among other use cases. [Principal ideas/results.] In this context, we propose FeClustRE, a framework integrating hybrid feature extraction, hierarchical clustering with auto-tuning and LLM-based semantic labelling. FeClustRE combines syntactic parsing with LLM enrichment, organizes features into clusters, and automatically generates meaningful taxonomy labels. We evaluate FeClustRE on public benchmarks for extraction correctness and on a sample study of generative AI assistant app reviews for clustering quality, semantic coherence, and interpretability. [Contribution.] Overall, FeClustRE delivers (1) a hybrid framework for feature extraction and taxonomy generation, (2) an auto-tuning mechanism with a comprehensive evaluation methodology, and (3) open-source and replicable implementation. These contributions bridge user feedback and feature understanding, enabling deeper insights into current and emerging requirements.</p></details> | Under review |

Characterizing Datasets for LLM-based Requirements Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18787v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[Context] Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on domain-specific datasets to achieve robust performance across training and inference stages. However, in Requirements Engineering (RE), data scarcity remains a persistent limitation reported in surveys and mapping studies. [Question/Problem] Although there are multiple datasets supporting LLM-based RE tasks (LLM4RE), they are fragmented and poorly characterized, limiting reuse and comparability. This research addresses the limited visibility and characterization of datasets used in LLM4RE. We investigate which public datasets are employed, how they can be systematically characterized, and which RE tasks and dataset descriptors remain under-represented. [Ideas/Results] To address this, we conduct a systematic mapping study to identify and analyse datasets used in LLM4RE research. A total of 62 publicly available datasets are referenced across 43 primary studies. Each dataset is characterized along descriptors such as artifact type, granularity, RE stage, task, domain, and language. Preliminary findings show multiple research gaps, including limited coverage for elicitation tasks, scarce datasets for management activities beyond traceability, and limited multilingual availability. [Contribution] This research preview offers a public catalogue and structured characterization scheme to support dataset selection, comparison, and reuse in LLM4RE research. Future work will extend the scope to grey literature, as well as integration with open dataset and benchmark repositories.</p></details> | Under review |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Causally Perturbed Fairness Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18719v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features (e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in engineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key challenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an intractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing on designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about data characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting their full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT. Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most directly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive counterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a causal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide a test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves as a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators. Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation, CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more efficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all cases.</p></details> | accepted by TOSEM |

This review synthesizes real-life experiences of using alternative (non-traditional) contracting and funding approaches. The focus is on identifying approaches that align better with agile principles and understanding the motivations, benefits, and challenges these alternatives present. A systematic literature review was conducted in SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, where we identified 38 relevant peer-reviewed empirical studies from private and public sector contexts. Four alternative funding and four alternative contracting approaches were identified. Organizations were motivated to adopt these alternative approaches because traditional approaches often proved too rigid, conflicted with agile principles, hindered effective client-contractor collaboration, and limited profitability. The benefits of these alternatives included higher client satisfaction, reduced contractor risk, and more efficient resource utilization. Adopting alternative funding and contracting approaches may promote flexibility and efficiency in agile projects but also presents cultural and structural challenges, increases the risk of scope creep and analysis paralysis, and requires additional effort in terms of time and resources. The context of the organization matters highly in selecting a suitable approach, such as the organizational readiness in terms of its leaders, people, and systems. Thus, instead of wholly adopting alternative approaches and introducing changes abruptly, organizations may benefit from starting with hybrid approaches that balance flexibility and control and progressively transition to fully flexible approaches tailored to their needs</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 6 tables, 6 figures and 3 appendices</p></details> |

One way to catch regressions before they reach production is executing performance tests before deployment, e.g., using microbenchmarks, which measure performance at subroutine level. In projects with many microbenchmarks, this may take several hours due to repeated execution to get accurate results, disqualifying them from frequent use in CI/CD pipelines. We propose $\mu$OpTime, a static approach to reduce the execution time of microbenchmark suites by configuring the number of repetitions for each microbenchmark. Based on the results of a full, previous microbenchmark suite run, $\mu$OpTime determines the minimal number of (measurement) repetitions with statistical stability metrics that still lead to accurate results. We evaluate $\mu$OpTime with an experimental study on 14 open-source projects written in two programming languages and five stability metrics. Our results show that (i) $\mu$OpTime reduces the total suite execution time (measurement phase) by up to 95.83% (Go) and 94.17% (Java), (ii) the choice of stability metric depends on the project and programming language, (iii) microbenchmark warmup phases have to be considered for Java projects (potentially leading to higher reductions), and (iv) $\mu$OpTime can be used to reliably detect performance regressions in CI/CD pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |
| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20749v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

The domain of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is no exception, as raw data typically consists of large amounts of time-series data logging the system's status in regular time intervals. Such data has to be sanity checked and preprocessed to be consumable by data-centric workflows. We introduce CPSLint, a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide data preparation for industrial CPS. We build up on the fact that many raw data collections in the CPS domain require similar actions to render them suitable for Machine-Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) workflows, yet still vary enough to hope for one universally applicable solution. CPSLint's main features include type checking and enforcing constraints through validation and remediation for data columns, such as imputing missing data from surrounding rows. More advanced features cover inference of extra CPS-specific data structures, both column-wise and row-wise. For instance, as row-wise structures, descriptive execution phases are an effective method of data compartmentalisation are extracted and prepared for ML-assisted FDI workflows. We demonstrate CPSLint's features through a proof of concept implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Optimized Benchmarking Platform for CI/CD Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18640v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance regressions in large-scale software systems can lead to substantial resource inefficiencies, making their early detection critical. Frequent benchmarking is essential for identifying these regressions and maintaining service-level agreements (SLAs). Performance benchmarks, however, are resource-intensive and time-consuming, which is a major challenge for integration into Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Although numerous benchmark optimization techniques have been proposed to accelerate benchmark execution, there is currently no practical system that integrates these optimizations seamlessly into real-world CI/CD pipelines. In this vision paper, we argue that the field of benchmark optimization remains under-explored in key areas that hinder its broader adoption. We identify three central challenges to enabling frequent and efficient benchmarking: (a) the composability of benchmark optimization strategies, (b) automated evaluation of benchmarking results, and (c) the usability and complexity of applying these strategies as part of CI/CD systems in practice. We also introduce a conceptual cloud-based benchmarking framework handling these challenges transparently. By presenting these open problems, we aim to stimulate research toward making performance regression detection in CI/CD systems more practical and effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models in detecting Secrets in Android Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18601v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile apps often embed authentication secrets, such as API keys, tokens, and client IDs, to integrate with cloud services. However, developers often hardcode these credentials into Android apps, exposing them to extraction through reverse engineering. Once compromised, adversaries can exploit secrets to access sensitive data, manipulate resources, or abuse APIs, resulting in significant security and financial risks. Existing detection approaches, such as regex-based analysis, static analysis, and machine learning, are effective for identifying known patterns but are fundamentally limited: they require prior knowledge of credential structures, API signatures, or training data. In this paper, we propose SecretLoc, an LLM-based approach for detecting hardcoded secrets in Android apps. SecretLoc goes beyond pattern matching; it leverages contextual and structural cues to identify secrets without relying on predefined patterns or labeled training sets. Using a benchmark dataset from the literature, we demonstrate that SecretLoc detects secrets missed by regex-, static-, and ML-based methods, including previously unseen types of secrets. In total, we discovered 4828 secrets that were undetected by existing approaches, discovering more than 10 "new" types of secrets, such as OpenAI API keys, GitHub Access Tokens, RSA private keys, and JWT tokens, and more. We further extend our analysis to newly crawled apps from Google Play, where we uncovered and responsibly disclosed additional hardcoded secrets. Across a set of 5000 apps, we detected secrets in 2124 apps (42.5%), several of which were confirmed and remediated by developers after we contacted them. Our results reveal a dual-use risk: if analysts can uncover these secrets with LLMs, so can attackers. This underscores the urgent need for proactive secret management and stronger mitigation practices across the mobile ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

While script-based verifiers are widely adopted for evaluation, they suffer from limited scalability and inability to provide step-wise assessment. Reward models offer promising alternatives, but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench, comprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward Benchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic assessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse, Practical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10 software categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels (25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through carefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure reliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and Insights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3 prompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including insufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the superiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation. (4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our comprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that significantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting and strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and 93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially outperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing methods rely solely on outcome rewards, without explicitly optimizing verification or leveraging reliable signals from realistic environments, leading to unreliable self-verification and limited test-time scaling. To address this, we widen the verification-generation asymmetry by explicitly optimizing self-verification, making it a reliable driver of deeper test-time scaling. We introduce ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that evolves code generation through self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal structures long-horizon reasoning as iterative generation-verification turns and incorporates TAPO for turn-level credit assignment, fostering the co-evolution of code and test generation. At inference, this strengthened self-verification enables the model to use self-constructed tests and tool feedback to continuously evolve code for 20+ turns on LiveCodeBench despite training on only three. It also significantly improves Pass@k, indicating stronger exploration that expands the reasoning boundaries of the base model. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable paradigm for RL training and test-time scaling, paving the way for more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework based on five key criteria: Business Process Orchestration, UI/UX Customization, Integration and Interoperability, Governance and Security, and AI-Enhanced Automation. We propose a weighted scoring model that allows organizations to quantitatively assess and compare different low-code platforms based on their specific requirements and strategic priorities. The framework addresses the gap between marketing-driven platform comparisons and rigorous, context-specific evaluation methodologies. Through empirical validation in enterprise environments, we demonstrate how this structured approach can significantly improve decision-making outcomes and reduce the risk of platform lock-in or inadequate solution selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figure.

However, its reliability in open-ended tasks with dynamic environments and complex interactions remains unexplored. To bridge the gap, we introduce WebDevJudge, a systematic benchmark for assessing LLM-as-a-judge performance in web development, with support for both non-interactive evaluation based on static observations and continuous interactive evaluation with a dynamic web environment. WebDevJudge comprises human preference labels over paired web implementations, annotated with structured and query-grounded rubrics to ensure high-quality ground truth. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate various evaluators, including LLMs, MLLMs, and agentic workflows. We systematically investigate the impact of different paradigms and guidance mechanisms. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between LLM judges and human experts. In-depth analysis indicates this gap stems from fundamental model limitations, including failures in recognizing functional equivalence, verifying task feasibility, and mitigating bias. Overall, WebDevJudge presents a significant challenge to LLM-as-a-judge, offering insights to guide future research toward developing more reliable and capable automated evaluators for complicated scenarios.

However, quantum programs adhere to fundamentally different semantics, such as unitarity, entanglement, the no-cloning theorem, and the destructive nature of measurement, which introduce challenges to the safe use of classical abstraction mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental conflict in quantum software engineering: abstraction practices that are syntactically valid may violate the physical constraints of quantum computation. We present three classes of failure cases where naive abstraction breaks quantum semantics and propose a set of design principles for physically sound abstraction mechanisms. We further propose research directions, including quantum-specific type systems, effect annotations, and contract-based module design. Our goal is to initiate a systematic rethinking of abstraction in quantum software engineering, based on quantum semantics and considering engineering scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |

Previous LLM-based code efficiency optimization approaches exclusively focus on function-level optimization and overlook interaction between functions, failing to generalize to real-world development scenarios. Code editing techniques show great potential for conducting project-level optimization, yet they face challenges associated with invalid edits and suboptimal internal functions. To address these gaps, we propose Peace, a novel hybrid framework for Project-level code Efficiency optimization through Automatic Code Editing, which also ensures the overall correctness and integrity of the project. Peace integrates three key phases: dependency-aware optimizing function sequence construction, valid associated edits identification, and efficiency optimization editing iteration. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of Peace, we construct PeacExec, the first benchmark comprising 146 real-world optimization tasks from 47 high-impact GitHub Python projects, along with highly qualified test cases and executable environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate Peace's superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 69.2% correctness rate (pass@1), +46.9% opt rate, and 0.840 speedup in execution efficiency. Notably, our Peace outperforms all baselines by significant margins, particularly in complex optimization tasks with multiple functions. Moreover, extensive experiments are also conducted to validate the contributions of each component in Peace, as well as the rationale and effectiveness of our hybrid framework design.</p></details> |  |

A precise and detailed elicitation of the coverage for project demonstrators is often an afterthought and not sufficiently detailed during proposal writing. This practice leads to continuous confusion and a mismatch between targeted and achievable demonstration of results, hindering progress. The reliance on the TRL scale as a loose descriptor does not help either. We propose a demonstrator requirements elaboration framework aiming to evaluate the feasibility of targeted demonstrations, making realistic adjustments, and assist in describing requirements. In doing so, we define 5 hierarchical levels of demonstration, clearly connected to expectations, e.g., work package interaction, and also connected to the project's industrial use-cases. The considered application scope in this paper is the domain of software-intensive systems and industrial cyber-physical systems. A complete validation is not accessible, as it would require application of our framework at the start of a project and observing the results at the end, taking 4-5 years. Nonetheless, we have applied it to two research projects from our portfolio, one at the early and another at the final stages, revealing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mining Service Behavior for Stateful Service Emulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18519v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise software systems are increasingly integrating with diverse services to meet expanding business demands. Testing these highly interconnected systems presents a challenge due to the need for access to the connected services. Service virtualization has emerged as a widely used technique to derive service models from recorded interactions, for service response generation during system testing. Various methods have been proposed to emulate actual service behavior based on these interactions, but most fail to account for the service's state, which reduces the accuracy of service emulation and the realism of the testing environment, especially when dealing with stateful services. This paper proposes an approach to deriving service models from service interactions, which enhance the accuracy of response generation by considering service state. This is achieved by uncovering contextual dependencies among interaction messages and analyzing the relationships between message data values. The approach is evaluated using interaction traces collected from both stateful and stateless services, and the results reveal notable enhancements in accuracy and efficiency over existing approaches in service response generation.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[VAPU: System for Autonomous Legacy Code Modernization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18509v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a solution for the modernization of legacy applications, an area of code generation where LLM-based multi-agent systems are proving essential for complex multi-phased tasks. Legacy applications often contain deprecated components that create compatibility, security, and reliability risks, but high resource costs make companies hesitate to update. We take a step forward to integrate an LLM-based multi-agent system as part of a legacy web application update to provide a cost-effective solution to update legacy applications autonomously. We propose a multi-agent system named a Verifying Agent Pipeline Updater (VAPU), which is designed to update code files in phases while simulating different roles in a software development team. In our previous study, we evaluated the system for legacy version updates by using six legacy web application view files by resulting errors and accomplished requirements. This study extends the previous evaluation of a multi-agent pipeline system by extending the evaluation of VAPU from a single LLM to five LLMs and using the temperature parameter in both 0 to 1 settings. Additionally, we tested the system with 20 open-source Python GitHub projects. The results of the evaluation were compared to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning (OSL) prompts. The extended evaluation of VAPU showed that particularly in a low-temperature VAPU can get similar level of error count compared to the ZSL/OSL prompts but with a higher level of fulfilled requirements, depending on the LLM. VAPU showed up to 22.5% increase in the succeeding Python file update requirements compared to ZSL/OSL prompts. The study indicates that an LLM-based multi-agent system is a capable solution to update components of a legacy application autonomously.</p></details> | Table 13, figure 2 |

GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl, including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark, state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15% improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model, Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters, this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community, encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Data-Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00046v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training data, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[CodeRL+: Improving Code Generation via Reinforcement with Execution Semantics Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18471v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models in Thematic Analysis: Prompt Engineering, Evaluation, and Guidelines for Qualitative Software Engineering Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18456v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence advances, large language models (LLMs) are entering qualitative research workflows, yet no reproducible methods exist for integrating them into established approaches like thematic analysis (TA), one of the most common qualitative methods in software engineering research. Moreover, existing studies lack systematic evaluation of LLM-generated qualitative outputs against established quality criteria. We designed and iteratively refined prompts for Phases 2-5 of Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA, then tested outputs from multiple LLMs against codes and themes produced by experienced researchers. Using 15 interviews on software engineers' well-being, we conducted blind evaluations with four expert evaluators who applied rubrics derived directly from Braun and Clarke's quality criteria. Evaluators preferred LLM-generated codes 61% of the time, finding them analytically useful for answering the research question. However, evaluators also identified limitations: LLMs fragmented data unnecessarily, missed latent interpretations, and sometimes produced themes with unclear boundaries. Our contributions are threefold. First, a reproducible approach integrating refined, documented prompts with an evaluation framework to operationalize Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA. Second, an empirical comparison of LLM- and human-generated codes and themes in software engineering data. Third, guidelines for integrating LLMs into qualitative analysis while preserving methodological rigour, clarifying when and how LLMs can assist effectively and when human interpretation remains essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-World Usability of Vulnerability Proof-of-Concepts: A Comprehensive Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18448v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for a vulnerability is crucial in validating its existence, mitigating false positives, and illustrating the severity of the security threat it poses. However, research on PoCs significantly lags behind studies focusing on vulnerability data. This discrepancy can be directly attributed to several challenges, including the dispersion of real-world PoCs across multiple platforms, the diversity in writing styles, and the difficulty associated with PoC reproduction. To fill this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study on PoCs in the wild, assessing their report availability, completeness, reproducibility. Specifically, 1) to investigate PoC reports availability for CVE vulnerability, we collected an extensive dataset of 470,921 PoCs and their reports from 13 platforms, representing the broadest collection of publicly available PoCs to date. 2) To assess the completeness of PoC report at a fine-grained level, we proposed a component extraction method, which combines pattern-matching techniques with a fine-tuned BERT-NER model to extract 9 key components from PoC reports. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of PoCs, we recruited 8 participants to manually reproduce 150 sampled vulnerabilities with 32 vulnerability types based on PoC reports, enabling an in-depth analysis of PoC reproducibility and the factors influencing it. Our findings reveal that 78.9% of CVE vulnerabilities lack available PoCs, and existing PoC reports typically miss about 30% of the essential components required for effective vulnerability understanding and reproduction, with various reasons identified for the failure to reproduce vulnerabilities using available PoC reports. Finally, we proposed actionable strategies for stakeholders to enhance the overall usability of vulnerability PoCs in strengthening software security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human to Document, AI to Code: Three Case Studies of Comparing GenAI for Notebook Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18430v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks have become the preferred tool of choice for data scientists and practitioners to perform analyses and share results. Notebooks uniquely combine scripts with documentation. With the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, it is increasingly important, especially in competitive settings, to distinguish the characteristics of human-written versus GenAI. In this study, we present three case studies to explore potential strengths of both humans and GenAI through the coding and documenting activities in notebooks. We first characterize differences between 25 code and documentation features in human-written, medal-winning Kaggle notebooks. We find that gold medalists are primarily distinguished by longer and more detailed documentation. Second, we analyze the distinctions between human-written and GenAI notebooks. Our results show that while GenAI notebooks tend to achieve higher code quality (as measured by metrics like code smells and technical debt), human-written notebooks display greater structural diversity, complexity, and innovative approaches to problem-solving. Based on these results, we envision the work as groundwork that highlight four agendas to further investigate how GenAI could be utilized in notebooks that maximizes the potential collaboration between human and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Agents go Astray: Course-Correcting SWE Agents with PRMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02360v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex, multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM) that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0% to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as $0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents' reliability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLM-Based Mobile App Recommendations: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18364v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to recommend mobile applications through natural language prompts, offering a flexible alternative to keyword-based app store search. Yet, the reasoning behind these recommendations remains opaque, raising questions about their consistency, explainability, and alignment with traditional App Store Optimization (ASO) metrics. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how widely-used general purpose LLMs generate, justify, and rank mobile app recommendations. Our contributions are: (i) a taxonomy of 16 generalizable ranking criteria elicited from LLM outputs; (ii) a systematic evaluation framework to analyse recommendation consistency and responsiveness to explicit ranking instructions; and (iii) a replication package to support reproducibility and future research on AI-based recommendation systems. Our findings reveal that LLMs rely on a broad yet fragmented set of ranking criteria, only partially aligned with standard ASO metrics. While top-ranked apps tend to be consistent across runs, variability increases with ranking depth and search specificity. LLMs exhibit varying sensitivity to explicit ranking instructions - ranging from substantial adaptations to near-identical outputs - highlighting their complex reasoning dynamics in conversational app discovery. Our results aim to support end-users, app developers, and recommender-systems researchers in navigating the emerging landscape of conversational app discovery.</p></details> | Under review |

While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensuring Robustness in ML-enabled Software Systems: A User Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18292v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring robustness in ML-enabled software systems requires addressing critical challenges, such as silent failures, out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and adversarial attacks. Traditional software engineering practices, which rely on predefined logic, are insufficient for ML components that depend on data and probabilistic decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose the ML-On-Rails protocol, a unified framework designed to enhance the robustness and trustworthiness of ML-enabled systems in production. This protocol integrates key safeguards such as OOD detection, adversarial attack detection, input validation, and explainability. It also includes a model-to-software communication framework using HTTP status codes to enhance transparency in reporting model outcomes and errors. To align our approach with real-world challenges, we conducted a practitioner survey, which revealed major robustness issues, gaps in current solutions, and highlighted how a standardised protocol such as ML-On-Rails can improve system robustness. Our findings highlight the need for more support and resources for engineers working with ML systems. Finally, we outline future directions for refining the proposed protocol, leveraging insights from the survey and real-world applications to continually enhance its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RESCUE: Retrieval Augmented Secure Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18204v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still generate vulnerable code. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security knowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw security-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the significant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code generation with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base construction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize distillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security guidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a hierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base from top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each hierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated RESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure code generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE improves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed in-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness of individual components in RESCUE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Heuristic Guidance Based on Multiple Model Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15181v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning frameworks serve as the foundation for developing and deploying deep learning applications. To enhance the quality of deep learning frameworks, researchers have proposed numerous testing methods using deep learning models as test inputs. However, existing methods predominantly measure model bug detection effectiveness as heuristic indicators, presenting three critical limitations. Firstly, existing methods fail to quantitatively measure model's operator combination variety, potentially missing critical operator combinations that could trigger framework bugs. Secondly, existing methods neglect measuring and heuristically guiding the model execution time, resulting in the omission of numerous models potential for detecting more framework bugs within limited testing time. Thirdly, existing methods overlook correlation between different model measurements, relying simply on single-indicator heuristic guidance without considering their trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DLMMM, the first deep learning framework testing method to include multiple model measurements into heuristic guidance and fuse these measurements to achieve their trade-offs. DLMMM firstly quantitatively measures model's bug detection performance, operator combination variety, and model execution time. After that, DLMMM fuses these measurements based on their correlation to achieve their trade-offs. To further enhance testing effectiveness, DLMMM designs multi-level heuristic guidance for test input model generation. We apply DLMMM to test three widely used deep learning frameworks (including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MindSpore). The experimental results show that DLMMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness, Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency. AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$ recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above $80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent resilience in realistic enterprise settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models</p></details> |
| **[Saber: An Efficient Sampling with Adaptive Acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking for Diffusion Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18165v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4% inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhyFlow: Interrogative Debugger for Sensemaking Taint Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Program Semantics Reasoning with Type Inference in System F](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23686v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM (Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '25, package released at: https://github.com/SecurityLab-UCD/TF-Bench</p></details> |

To support this growth, cloud providers offer ML services to ease the integration of ML components in software systems. The evolving business requirements and the popularity of ML services have led practitioners of all skill levels to implement, and maintain ML service-based systems. However, they may not always adhere to optimal design and usage practices for ML cloud services, resulting in common misuse which could significantly degrade the quality of ML service-based systems and adversely affect their maintenance and evolution. Though much research has been conducted on ML service misuse, a consistent terminology and specification for these misuses remain absent. We therefore conduct in this paper a comprehensive, multi-vocal empirical study exploring the prevalence of ML cloud service misuses in practice. We propose a catalog of 20 ML cloud service misuses, most of which have not been studied in prior research. To achieve this, we conducted a) a systematic literature review of studies on ML misuses, b) a gray literature review of the official documentation provided by major cloud providers, c) an empirical analysis of a curated set of 377 ML service-based systems on GitHub, and d) a survey with 50 ML practitioners. Our results show that ML service misuses are common in both open-source projects and industry, often stemming from a lack of understanding of service capabilities, and insufficient documentation. This emphasizes the importance of ongoing education in best practices for ML services, which is the focus of this paper, while also highlighting the need for tools to automatically detect and refactor ML misuses.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlueCodeAgent: A Blue Teaming Agent Enabled by Automated Red Teaming for CodeGen AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18131v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation, concerns over the security risks have grown substantially. Early research has primarily focused on red teaming, which aims to uncover and evaluate vulnerabilities and risks of CodeGen models. However, progress on the blue teaming side remains limited, as developing defense requires effective semantic understanding to differentiate the unsafe from the safe. To fill in this gap, we propose BlueCodeAgent, an end-to-end blue teaming agent enabled by automated red teaming. Our framework integrates both sides: red teaming generates diverse risky instances, while the blue teaming agent leverages these to detect previously seen and unseen risk scenarios through constitution and code analysis with agentic integration for multi-level defense. Our evaluation across three representative code-related tasks--bias instruction detection, malicious instruction detection, and vulnerable code detection--shows that BlueCodeAgent achieves significant gains over the base models and safety prompt-based defenses. In particular, for vulnerable code detection tasks, BlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic analysis to effectively reduce false positives, a challenging problem as base models tend to be over-conservative, misclassifying safe code as unsafe. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average 12.7\% F1 score improvement across four datasets in three tasks, attributed to its ability to summarize actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware risk detection. We demonstrate that the red teaming benefits the blue teaming by continuously identifying new vulnerabilities to enhance defense performance.</p></details> |  |

Accurately identifying and classifying NFRs is essential to ensure that software meets performance, usability, and reliability expectations. However, manual identification of NFRs from documentation is time-consuming and prone to errors, necessitating automated solutions. Before implementing any automated solution, a robust and comprehensive dataset is essential. To build such a dataset, we collected NFRs from various Project Charters and Open Source Software Documentation. This enhanced the technical depth and usability of an already existing NFR dataset. We categorized NFRs into sub-classes and identified needs using widely used Large Language Models to facilitate automation. After classifying the NFRs, we compared the classification results of the selected LLMs: RoBERTa, CodeBERT, Gemma-2, Phi-3, Mistral-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B using various evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and lime scores. Among these models, Gemma-2 achieved the best results with a precision of 0.87, recall of 0.89, and F1-score of 0.88, alongside a lime hit score of 78 out of 80. Phi-3 closely followed with a precision of 0.85, recall of 0.87, F1-score of 0.86, and the highest lime hit score of 79. By improving the contextual foundation, this integration enhanced the model's comprehension of technical aspects and user requirements.</p></details> |  |

Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing.

While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model, DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each (source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally, EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into agent-based frameworks.

| **[Streamlining Acceptance Test Generation for Mobile Applications Through Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18861v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile acceptance testing remains a bottleneck in modern software development, particularly for cross-platform mobile development using frameworks like Flutter. While developers increasingly rely on automated testing tools, creating and maintaining acceptance test artifacts still demands significant manual effort. To help tackle this issue, we introduce AToMIC, an automated framework leveraging specialized Large Language Models to generate Gherkin scenarios, Page Objects, and executable UI test scripts directly from requirements (JIRA tickets) and recent code changes. Applied to BMW's MyBMW app, covering 13 real-world issues in a 170+ screen codebase, AToMIC produced executable test artifacts in under five minutes per feature on standard hardware. The generated artifacts were of high quality: 93.3% of Gherkin scenarios were syntactically correct upon generation, 78.8% of PageObjects ran without manual edits, and 100% of generated UI tests executed successfully. In a survey, all practitioners reported time savings (often a full developer-day per feature) and strong confidence in adopting the approach. These results confirm AToMIC as a scalable, practical solution for streamlining acceptance test creation and maintenance in industrial mobile projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20749v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues. Data and code are available at https://alfin06.github.io/AgentIssue-Bench-Leaderboard/#/ .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CUARewardBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reward Models on Computer-using Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18596v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-using agents (CUAs) enable task completion through natural interaction with operating systems and software interfaces. While script-based verifiers are widely adopted for evaluation, they suffer from limited scalability and inability to provide step-wise assessment. Reward models offer promising alternatives, but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench, comprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward Benchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic assessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse, Practical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10 software categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels (25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through carefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure reliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and Insights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3 prompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including insufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the superiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation. (4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our comprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that significantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting and strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and 93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially outperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing methods rely solely on outcome rewards, without explicitly optimizing verification or leveraging reliable signals from realistic environments, leading to unreliable self-verification and limited test-time scaling. To address this, we widen the verification-generation asymmetry by explicitly optimizing self-verification, making it a reliable driver of deeper test-time scaling. We introduce ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that evolves code generation through self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal structures long-horizon reasoning as iterative generation-verification turns and incorporates TAPO for turn-level credit assignment, fostering the co-evolution of code and test generation. At inference, this strengthened self-verification enables the model to use self-constructed tests and tool feedback to continuously evolve code for 20+ turns on LiveCodeBench despite training on only three. It also significantly improves Pass@k, indicating stronger exploration that expands the reasoning boundaries of the base model. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable paradigm for RL training and test-time scaling, paving the way for more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Structured Evaluation Framework for Low-Code Platform Selection: A Multi-Criteria Decision Model for Enterprise Digital Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18590v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDPs) has created a critical need for systematic evaluation methodologies that enable organizations to make informed platform selection decisions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework based on five key criteria: Business Process Orchestration, UI/UX Customization, Integration and Interoperability, Governance and Security, and AI-Enhanced Automation. We propose a weighted scoring model that allows organizations to quantitatively assess and compare different low-code platforms based on their specific requirements and strategic priorities. The framework addresses the gap between marketing-driven platform comparisons and rigorous, context-specific evaluation methodologies. Through empirical validation in enterprise environments, we demonstrate how this structured approach can significantly improve decision-making outcomes and reduce the risk of platform lock-in or inadequate solution selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figure.

| **[WebDevJudge: Evaluating (M)LLMs as Critiques for Web Development Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18560v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paradigm of LLM-as-a-judge is emerging as a scalable and efficient alternative to human evaluation, demonstrating strong performance on well-defined tasks. However, its reliability in open-ended tasks with dynamic environments and complex interactions remains unexplored. To bridge the gap, we introduce WebDevJudge, a systematic benchmark for assessing LLM-as-a-judge performance in web development, with support for both non-interactive evaluation based on static observations and continuous interactive evaluation with a dynamic web environment. WebDevJudge comprises human preference labels over paired web implementations, annotated with structured and query-grounded rubrics to ensure high-quality ground truth. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate various evaluators, including LLMs, MLLMs, and agentic workflows. We systematically investigate the impact of different paradigms and guidance mechanisms. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between LLM judges and human experts. In-depth analysis indicates this gap stems from fundamental model limitations, including failures in recognizing functional equivalence, verifying task feasibility, and mitigating bias. Overall, WebDevJudge presents a significant challenge to LLM-as-a-judge, offering insights to guide future research toward developing more reliable and capable automated evaluators for complicated scenarios.

| **[PEACE: Towards Efficient Project-Level Efficiency Optimization via Hybrid Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17142v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capability in code generation, but their potential in code efficiency optimization remains underexplored. Previous LLM-based code efficiency optimization approaches exclusively focus on function-level optimization and overlook interaction between functions, failing to generalize to real-world development scenarios. Code editing techniques show great potential for conducting project-level optimization, yet they face challenges associated with invalid edits and suboptimal internal functions. To address these gaps, we propose Peace, a novel hybrid framework for Project-level code Efficiency optimization through Automatic Code Editing, which also ensures the overall correctness and integrity of the project. Peace integrates three key phases: dependency-aware optimizing function sequence construction, valid associated edits identification, and efficiency optimization editing iteration. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of Peace, we construct PeacExec, the first benchmark comprising 146 real-world optimization tasks from 47 high-impact GitHub Python projects, along with highly qualified test cases and executable environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate Peace's superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 69.2% correctness rate (pass@1), +46.9% opt rate, and 0.840 speedup in execution efficiency. Notably, our Peace outperforms all baselines by significant margins, particularly in complex optimization tasks with multiple functions. Moreover, extensive experiments are also conducted to validate the contributions of each component in Peace, as well as the rationale and effectiveness of our hybrid framework design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demonstrators for Industrial Cyber-Physical System Research: A Requirements Hierarchy Driven by Software-Intensive Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18534v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the challenges apparent in the organisation of research projects is the uncertainties around the subject of demonstrators. A precise and detailed elicitation of the coverage for project demonstrators is often an afterthought and not sufficiently detailed during proposal writing. This practice leads to continuous confusion and a mismatch between targeted and achievable demonstration of results, hindering progress. The reliance on the TRL scale as a loose descriptor does not help either. We propose a demonstrator requirements elaboration framework aiming to evaluate the feasibility of targeted demonstrations, making realistic adjustments, and assist in describing requirements. In doing so, we define 5 hierarchical levels of demonstration, clearly connected to expectations, e.g., work package interaction, and also connected to the project's industrial use-cases. The considered application scope in this paper is the domain of software-intensive systems and industrial cyber-physical systems. A complete validation is not accessible, as it would require application of our framework at the start of a project and observing the results at the end, taking 4-5 years. Nonetheless, we have applied it to two research projects from our portfolio, one at the early and another at the final stages, revealing its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAPU: System for Autonomous Legacy Code Modernization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18509v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a solution for the modernization of legacy applications, an area of code generation where LLM-based multi-agent systems are proving essential for complex multi-phased tasks. Legacy applications often contain deprecated components that create compatibility, security, and reliability risks, but high resource costs make companies hesitate to update. We take a step forward to integrate an LLM-based multi-agent system as part of a legacy web application update to provide a cost-effective solution to update legacy applications autonomously. We propose a multi-agent system named a Verifying Agent Pipeline Updater (VAPU), which is designed to update code files in phases while simulating different roles in a software development team. In our previous study, we evaluated the system for legacy version updates by using six legacy web application view files by resulting errors and accomplished requirements. This study extends the previous evaluation of a multi-agent pipeline system by extending the evaluation of VAPU from a single LLM to five LLMs and using the temperature parameter in both 0 to 1 settings. Additionally, we tested the system with 20 open-source Python GitHub projects. The results of the evaluation were compared to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning (OSL) prompts. The extended evaluation of VAPU showed that particularly in a low-temperature VAPU can get similar level of error count compared to the ZSL/OSL prompts but with a higher level of fulfilled requirements, depending on the LLM. VAPU showed up to 22.5% increase in the succeeding Python file update requirements compared to ZSL/OSL prompts. The study indicates that an LLM-based multi-agent system is a capable solution to update components of a legacy application autonomously.</p></details> | Table 13, figure 2 |
| **[Exploring Data-Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00046v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training data, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[CodeRL+: Improving Code Generation via Reinforcement with Execution Semantics Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18471v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models in Thematic Analysis: Prompt Engineering, Evaluation, and Guidelines for Qualitative Software Engineering Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18456v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence advances, large language models (LLMs) are entering qualitative research workflows, yet no reproducible methods exist for integrating them into established approaches like thematic analysis (TA), one of the most common qualitative methods in software engineering research. Moreover, existing studies lack systematic evaluation of LLM-generated qualitative outputs against established quality criteria. We designed and iteratively refined prompts for Phases 2-5 of Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA, then tested outputs from multiple LLMs against codes and themes produced by experienced researchers. Using 15 interviews on software engineers' well-being, we conducted blind evaluations with four expert evaluators who applied rubrics derived directly from Braun and Clarke's quality criteria. Evaluators preferred LLM-generated codes 61% of the time, finding them analytically useful for answering the research question. However, evaluators also identified limitations: LLMs fragmented data unnecessarily, missed latent interpretations, and sometimes produced themes with unclear boundaries. Our contributions are threefold. First, a reproducible approach integrating refined, documented prompts with an evaluation framework to operationalize Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA. Second, an empirical comparison of LLM- and human-generated codes and themes in software engineering data. Third, guidelines for integrating LLMs into qualitative analysis while preserving methodological rigour, clarifying when and how LLMs can assist effectively and when human interpretation remains essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-World Usability of Vulnerability Proof-of-Concepts: A Comprehensive Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18448v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for a vulnerability is crucial in validating its existence, mitigating false positives, and illustrating the severity of the security threat it poses. However, research on PoCs significantly lags behind studies focusing on vulnerability data. This discrepancy can be directly attributed to several challenges, including the dispersion of real-world PoCs across multiple platforms, the diversity in writing styles, and the difficulty associated with PoC reproduction. To fill this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study on PoCs in the wild, assessing their report availability, completeness, reproducibility. Specifically, 1) to investigate PoC reports availability for CVE vulnerability, we collected an extensive dataset of 470,921 PoCs and their reports from 13 platforms, representing the broadest collection of publicly available PoCs to date. 2) To assess the completeness of PoC report at a fine-grained level, we proposed a component extraction method, which combines pattern-matching techniques with a fine-tuned BERT-NER model to extract 9 key components from PoC reports. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of PoCs, we recruited 8 participants to manually reproduce 150 sampled vulnerabilities with 32 vulnerability types based on PoC reports, enabling an in-depth analysis of PoC reproducibility and the factors influencing it. Our findings reveal that 78.9% of CVE vulnerabilities lack available PoCs, and existing PoC reports typically miss about 30% of the essential components required for effective vulnerability understanding and reproduction, with various reasons identified for the failure to reproduce vulnerabilities using available PoC reports. Finally, we proposed actionable strategies for stakeholders to enhance the overall usability of vulnerability PoCs in strengthening software security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human to Document, AI to Code: Three Case Studies of Comparing GenAI for Notebook Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18430v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks have become the preferred tool of choice for data scientists and practitioners to perform analyses and share results. Notebooks uniquely combine scripts with documentation. With the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, it is increasingly important, especially in competitive settings, to distinguish the characteristics of human-written versus GenAI. In this study, we present three case studies to explore potential strengths of both humans and GenAI through the coding and documenting activities in notebooks. We first characterize differences between 25 code and documentation features in human-written, medal-winning Kaggle notebooks. We find that gold medalists are primarily distinguished by longer and more detailed documentation. Second, we analyze the distinctions between human-written and GenAI notebooks. Our results show that while GenAI notebooks tend to achieve higher code quality (as measured by metrics like code smells and technical debt), human-written notebooks display greater structural diversity, complexity, and innovative approaches to problem-solving. Based on these results, we envision the work as groundwork that highlight four agendas to further investigate how GenAI could be utilized in notebooks that maximizes the potential collaboration between human and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[InspectCoder: Dynamic Analysis-Enabled Self Repair through interactive LLM-Debugger Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18327v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensuring Robustness in ML-enabled Software Systems: A User Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18292v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring robustness in ML-enabled software systems requires addressing critical challenges, such as silent failures, out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and adversarial attacks. Traditional software engineering practices, which rely on predefined logic, are insufficient for ML components that depend on data and probabilistic decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose the ML-On-Rails protocol, a unified framework designed to enhance the robustness and trustworthiness of ML-enabled systems in production. This protocol integrates key safeguards such as OOD detection, adversarial attack detection, input validation, and explainability. It also includes a model-to-software communication framework using HTTP status codes to enhance transparency in reporting model outcomes and errors. To align our approach with real-world challenges, we conducted a practitioner survey, which revealed major robustness issues, gaps in current solutions, and highlighted how a standardised protocol such as ML-On-Rails can improve system robustness. Our findings highlight the need for more support and resources for engineers working with ML systems. Finally, we outline future directions for refining the proposed protocol, leveraging insights from the survey and real-world applications to continually enhance its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model, DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each (source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally, EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into agent-based frameworks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/EffiReasonTrans.</p></details> |  |
