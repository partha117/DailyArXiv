| **[AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defects4Log: Benchmarking LLMs for Logging Code Defect Detection and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11305v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniLLP: Enhancing LLM-based Log Level Prediction with Context-Aware Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08545v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8). Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy. Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally, our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and observability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07468v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceLens: Question-Driven Debugging for Taint Flow Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenCodeInstruct: A Large-scale Instruction Tuning Dataset for Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04030v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development by enabling code generation, automated debugging, and complex reasoning. However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01215v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |
| **[Automated File-Level Logging Generation for Machine Learning Applications using LLMs: A Case Study using GPT-4o Mini](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04820v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Prominent LLMs: An Empirical Study of Performance and Complexity in Solving LeetCode Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03931v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and DeepSeek are transforming software engineering by automating key tasks, including code generation, testing, and debugging. As these models become integral to development workflows, a systematic comparison of their performance is essential for optimizing their use in real world applications. This study benchmarks these four prominent LLMs on one hundred and fifty LeetCode problems across easy, medium, and hard difficulties, generating solutions in Java and Python. We evaluate each model based on execution time, memory usage, and algorithmic complexity, revealing significant performance differences. ChatGPT demonstrates consistent efficiency in execution time and memory usage, while Copilot and DeepSeek show variability as task complexity increases. Gemini, although effective on simpler tasks, requires more attempts as problem difficulty rises. Our findings provide actionable insights into each model's strengths and limitations, offering guidance for developers selecting LLMs for specific coding tasks and providing insights on the performance and complexity of GPT-like generated solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 13 figures, 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE)</p></details> |
| **[A Design Recipe and Recipe-Based Errors for Regular Expressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03639v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a novel framework to provide Formal Languages and Automata Theory students design support for the development of regular expressions. This framework includes a design recipe for regular expressions and a customized error messaging system. The error messaging system produces recipe-based errors that include the step of the design recipe not successfully completed. Furthermore, the error messages follow the established practices of being concise, succinct, jargon-free, and nonprescriptive. In addition, a shorthand syntax developed for writing unit tests is described. The in-class use of the design recipe is illustrated, two debugging sessions using the described system are discussed, and the implementation of the error messaging system is briefly sketched.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |
| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automata Models for Effective Bug Pattern Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11146v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging complex systems is a crucial yet time-consuming task. This paper presents the use of automata learning and testing techniques to obtain concise and informative bug descriptions. We introduce the concepts of Failure Explanations (FE), Eventual Failure Explanations (EFE), and Early Detection (ED) to provide meaningful summaries of failing behavior patterns. By factoring out irrelevant information and focusing on essential test patterns, our approach aims to enhance bug detection and understanding. We evaluate our methods using various test patterns and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating their effectiveness in producing compact and informative bug descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ACM/IEEE 28th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CodeIF: Benchmarking the Instruction-Following Capabilities of Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19166v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for robust instruction-following capabilities in code generation tasks has grown significantly. Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.

| **[Testing the Untestable? An Empirical Study on the Testing Process of LLM-Powered Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00198v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Software systems powered by large language models are becoming a routine part of everyday technologies, supporting applications across a wide range of domains. In software engineering, many studies have focused on how LLMs support tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation. However, there has been limited focus on how full systems that integrate LLMs are tested during development. Aims: This study explores how LLM-powered systems are tested in the context of real-world application development. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 99 individual reports written by students who built and deployed LLM-powered applications as part of a university course. Each report was independently analyzed using thematic analysis, supported by a structured coding process. Results: Testing strategies combined manual and automated methods to evaluate both system logic and model behavior. Common practices included exploratory testing, unit testing, and prompt iteration. Reported challenges included integration failures, unpredictable outputs, prompt sensitivity, hallucinations, and uncertainty about correctness. Conclusions: Testing LLM-powered systems required adaptations to traditional verification methods, blending source-level reasoning with behavior-aware evaluations. These findings provide evidence on the practical context of testing generative components in software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Screencast-Based Analysis of User-Perceived GUI Responsiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01337v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUI responsiveness is critical for a positive user experience in mobile applications. Even brief delays in visual feedback can frustrate users and lead to negative reviews. However, detecting and quantifying such user-perceived delays remains challenging, especially in industrial testing pipelines that evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions. Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful, may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively. In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts -- video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Code Generation with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00083v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Machine Learning Pipeline for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00045v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of software development practices has introduced challenges in ensuring quality and efficiency across the software engineering (SE) lifecycle. As SE systems grow in complexity, traditional approaches often fail to scale, resulting in longer debugging times, inefficient defect detection, and resource-heavy development cycles. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a key solution, enabling automation in tasks such as defect prediction, code review, and release quality estimation. However, the effectiveness of ML in SE depends on the robustness of its pipeline, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, validation, and evaluation. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines state-of-the-art ML pipelines designed for SE, consolidating best practices, challenges, and gaps. Our findings show that robust preprocessing, such as SMOTE for data balancing and SZZ-based algorithms for feature selection, improves model reliability. Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting dominate performance across tasks, while simpler models such as Naive Bayes remain valuable for efficiency and interpretability. Evaluation metrics including AUC, F1-score, and precision are most common, with new metrics like Best Arithmetic Mean (BAM) emerging in niche applications. Validation techniques such as bootstrapping are widely used to ensure model stability and generalizability. This SLR highlights the importance of well-designed ML pipelines for addressing SE challenges and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize software quality and efficiency. By identifying gaps and trends, this study sets a foundation for advancing ML adoption and fostering innovation in increasingly complex development environments.</p></details> |  |

However, ABPs may raise specific concerns including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs, characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM research challenges towards XABPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoBridge: Automating Smart Device Integration with Centralized Platform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23178v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15 participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by 50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use commercial code LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under review</p></details> |

Debugging remains unsolved despite these advances. While Claude Opus 4 and GPT-4.1 achieve >70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they perform <15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model built specifically for debugging. Chronos combines Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to navigate codebases up to 10 million lines using multi-hop traversal (92% precision, 85% recall), Persistent Debug Memory trained on 15M+ sessions, and a 7-layer architecture for iterative fix-test-refine loops. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy, compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude and GPT-4.1 respectively. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iteration count by 65%. It resolves complex multi-file bugs involving cross-repository context and temporal reasoning. Key limitations include 23.4% success on hardware-dependent issues and 41.2% on dynamic language errors. Theoretical analysis shows O(k log d) retrieval complexity with convergence guarantees. In a human evaluation (N=50), 89% of participants preferred Chronos over baseline models.

| **[HLSDebugger: Identification and Correction of Logic Bugs in HLS Code with LLM Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21485v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction. complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of automated debugging of HLS code.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at ICCAD 2025 (International Conference on Computer-Aided Design)</p></details> |

Traditional debugging techniques from classical software engineering cannot directly resolve this issue due to the inherently stochastic nature of quantum computation mixed with noises from NISQ computers. To address this gap, we propose a statistical approach leveraging probabilistic metrics to differentiate between quantum software bugs and hardware noise. We evaluate our methodology empirically using well-known quantum algorithms, including Grover's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Simon's algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach, providing quantum software developers with a reliable analytical tool to identify and classify unexpected behavior in quantum programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 30 figures, accepted by the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE), IEEE Quantum Week, 2025</p></details> |
| **[BOOP: Write Right Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22085v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers frequently adopt a syntax-specific and test-case-driven approach, writing code first and adjusting until programs compile and test cases pass, rather than developing correct solutions through systematic reasoning. AI coding tools exacerbate this challenge by providing syntactically correct but conceptually flawed solutions. In this paper, we introduce BOOP (Blueprint, Operations, OCaml, Proof), a structured framework requiring four mandatory phases: formal specification, language-agnostic algorithm development, implementation, and correctness proof. This shifts focus from ``making code work'' to understanding why code is correct. BOOP was implemented at our institution using a VS Code extension and preprocessor that enforces constraints and identifies counterproductive patterns. Initial evaluation shows improved algorithmic reasoning and reduced trial-and-error debugging. Students reported better edge case understanding and problem decomposition, though some initially found the format verbose. Instructors observed stronger foundational skills compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentMesh: A Cooperative Multi-Agent Generative AI Framework for Software Development Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19902v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents - a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication, and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations - such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLICEMATE: Accurate and Scalable Static Program Slicing via LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18957v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static program slicing, which extracts the executable portions of a program that affect the values at a specific location, supports many software analysis tasks such as debugging and security auditing. However, traditional slicing tools rely on computationally expensive reachability analysis over dependency graphs, which struggle to scale to large programs and often fail to handle code with incomplete syntax. Recently emerged learning-based methods, while more robust to such cases, still fall short of achieving comparable performance to traditional methods on well-formed code. In this work, we propose SliceMate, a novel static program slicing solution powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It bypasses the need for explicit dependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy. Concretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis agent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope across functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a verification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the candidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a refinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with the verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module that ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual intervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality benchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python programs, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly larger than those in existing slicing benchmarks. Experimental results show that SliceMate greatly outperforms both traditional and learning-based slicing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoCoder: Automated Function Synthesis using LLM-Supported Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18812v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts. To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs) in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding the Challenges of Bug Localization in Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01021v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bugs cost the global economy billions of dollars annually and claim ~50\% of the programming time from software developers. Locating these bugs is crucial for their resolution but challenging. It is even more challenging in deep-learning systems due to their black-box nature. Bugs in these systems are also hidden not only in the code but also in the models and training data, which might make traditional debugging methods less effective. In this article, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the challenges of localizing bugs in deep-learning systems. First, we determine the bug localization performance of four existing techniques using 2,365 bugs from deep-learning systems and 2,913 from traditional software. We found these techniques significantly underperform in localizing deep-learning system bugs. Second, we evaluate how different bug types in deep learning systems impact bug localization. We found that the effectiveness of localization techniques varies with bug type due to their unique challenges. For example, tensor bugs were more accessible to locate due to their structural nature, while all techniques struggled with GPU bugs due to their external dependencies. Third, we investigate the impact of bugs' extrinsic nature on localization in deep-learning systems. We found that deep learning bugs are often extrinsic and thus connected to artifacts other than source code (e.g., GPU, training data), contributing to the poor performance of existing localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Empirical Software Engineering Journal in 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02274v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Comprehension Benchmark for Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10641v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks. The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability. Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 5 Figures |

This paper documents the design, implementation, and iterative debugging of a novel, serverless system for real-time stock analysis. The system leverages the Gemini API for qualitative assessment, automates data ingestion and processing via GitHub Actions, and presents the findings through a decoupled, static frontend. We detail the architectural evolution of the system, from initial concepts to a robust, event-driven pipeline, highlighting the practical challenges encountered during deployment. A significant portion of this paper is dedicated to a case study on the debugging process, covering common software errors, platform-specific permission issues, and rare, environment-level platform bugs. The final architecture operates at a near-zero cost, demonstrating a viable model for individuals to build sophisticated AI-powered financial tools.

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool for Supporting Debugging and Understanding of Normative Requirements Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05504v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |

However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

The system provides an interactive experience similar to ChatGPT, tailored specifically for ReservoirPy, enabling users to write, debug, and understand Python code while accessing reliable domain-specific insights. In our evaluation, while proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o and NotebookLM performed slightly better on general knowledge questions, our model outperformed them on coding tasks and showed a significant improvement over its base model, Codestral-22B.</p></details> |  |

Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice.

Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Deduplicating Compiler Bugs with Bisection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It allows verifying that the students correctly apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students' misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g., no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to configure. To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CompEd'25, 7 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks, establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.</p></details> |  |

LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model Guided Self-Debugging Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02928v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code generation is gaining significant importance in intelligent computer programming and system deployment. However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |
| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Challenges and Practices in Quantum Software Testing and Debugging: Insights from Practitioners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17306v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum software engineering is an emerging discipline with distinct challenges, particularly in testing and debugging. As quantum computing transitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present in classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited observability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific tools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software developers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews focused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants reported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing (54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31% reported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual methods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies, such as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which respondents noted do not scale well. The most frequently cited sources of bugs were classical in nature-library updates (81%), developer mistakes (68%), and compatibility issues (62%)-often worsened by limited abstraction in existing SDKs. These findings highlight the urgent need for better-aligned testing and debugging tools, integrated more seamlessly into the workflows of quantum developers. We present these results in detail and offer actionable recommendations grounded in the real-world needs of practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios. We hope this work can uncover the potential of LLMs in multi-library debugging scenario and offer insights for future research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |

Bugs in widely used deep learning APIs can propagate to downstream systems, causing serious consequences. While existing fuzzing techniques detect bugs through intra-framework testing across hardware backends (CPU vs. GPU), they may miss bugs that manifest identically across backends and thus escape detection under these strategies. To address this problem, we propose XAMT, a cross-framework fuzzing method that tests deep learning libraries by matching and comparing functionally equivalent APIs across different frameworks. XAMT matches APIs using similarity-based rules based on names, descriptions, and parameter structures. It then aligns inputs and applies variance-guided differential testing to detect bugs. We evaluated XAMT on five popular frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and JAX. XAMT matched 839 APIs and identified 238 matched API groups, and detected 17 bugs, 12 of which have been confirmed. Our results show that XAMT uncovers bugs undetectable by intra-framework testing, especially those that manifest consistently across backends. XAMT offers a complementary approach to existing methods and offers a new perspective on the testing of deep learning libraries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Where Are Large Language Models for Code Generation on GitHub?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19544v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has garnered significant attention from researchers assessing the quality of the code they generate. However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which fail to adequately represent how developers actually utilize LLMs' code generation capabilities or clarify the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To bridge this gap, our study investigates the characteristics of LLM-generated code and its corresponding projects hosted on GitHub. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot are the most frequently utilized for generating code on GitHub. In contrast, there is very little code generated by other LLMs on GitHub. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code are often small and less known, led by individuals or small teams. Despite this, most projects are continuously evolving and improving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot is mainly utilized for generating Python, Java, and TypeScript scripts for data processing and transformation. C/C++ and JavaScript code generation focuses on algorithm and data structure implementation and user interface code. Most ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code snippets are relatively short and exhibit low complexity. (4) Compared to human-written code, ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code exists in a small proportion of projects and generally undergoes fewer modifications. Additionally, modifications due to bugs are even fewer, ranging from just 3% to 8% across different languages. (5) Most comments on ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code lack detailed information, often only stating the code's origin without mentioning prompts, human modifications, or testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding LLM-Centric Challenges for Deep Learning Frameworks: An Empirical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13114v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress across a wide range of real-world applications. Realizing such models requires substantial system-level support. Deep learning (DL) frameworks provide this foundation by enabling efficient model construction, distributed execution, and optimized deployment. The large parameter scale and extended execution cycles impose exacting demands on deep learning frameworks, particularly in terms of scalability, stability, and efficiency. Therefore, poor usability, limited functionality, and subtle bugs in DL frameworks may hinder development efficiency and cause severe failures or resource waste. However, a fundamental question has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies, i.e., what challenges do DL frameworks face in supporting LLMs? To answer this question, we analyze issue reports from three major DL frameworks (i.e., MindSpore, PyTorch, and TensorFlow) and eight associated LLM toolkits such as Megatron. Based on a manual review of these reports, we construct a taxonomy that captures LLM-centric framework bugs, user requirements, and user questions. We then refine and enrich this taxonomy through interviews with 11 LLM users and eight DL framework developers. Based on the constructed taxonomy and findings summarized from interviews, our study further reveals key technical challenges and mismatches between LLM user needs and developer priorities.</p></details> | 46 pages, 14 figures |

However, these models require significant computational resources for training and fine-tuning, posing challenges for real-world adoption in resource-constrained environments. To address this, the research community has increasingly turned to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)-a class of techniques that enables the adaptation of large models by updating only a small subset of parameters, rather than the entire model. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we examine the growing application of PEFT techniques-across a wide range of software engineering tasks. We analyze how these methods are used to optimize various deep learning (DL) architectures, focusing on their impact on both performance and efficiency. Our study synthesizes findings from 28 peer-reviewed papers, identifying patterns in configuration strategies and adaptation trade-offs. The outcome of this review is a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes PEFT usage by task type, distinguishing between generative (e.g., Code Summarization) and non-generative (e.g., Code Clone Detection) scenarios. Our findings aim to inform future research and guide the practical deployment of PEFT in sustainable, AI-powered software development.

| **[Fast and Accurate Silent Vulnerability Fix Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22935v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An upstream task for software bill-of-materials (SBOMs) is the accurate localization of the patch that fixes a vulnerability. Nevertheless, existing work reveals a significant gap in the CVEs whose patches exist but are not traceable. Existing works have proposed several approaches to trace/retrieve the patching commit for fixing a CVE. However, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) They cannot effectively handle long diff code of a commit; (2) We are not aware of existing work that scales to the full repository with satisfactory accuracy. Upon identifying this gap, we propose SITPatchTracer, a scalable and effective retrieval system for tracing known vulnerability patches. To handle the context length challenge, SITPatchTracer proposes a novel hierarchical embedding technique which efficiently extends the context coverage to 6x that of existing work while covering all files in the commit. To handle the scalability challenge, SITPatchTracer utilizes a three-phase framework, balancing the effectiveness/efficiency in each phase. The evaluation of SITPatchTracer demonstrates it outperforms existing patch tracing methods (PatchFinder, PatchScout, VFCFinder) by a large margin. Furthermore, SITPatchTracer outperforms VoyageAI, the SOTA commercial code embedding LLM (\$1.8 per 10K commits) on the MRR and Recall@10 by 18\% and 28\% on our two datasets. Using SITPatchTracer, we have successfully traced and merged the patch links for 35 new CVEs in the GitHub Advisory database Our ablation study reveals that hierarchical embedding is a practically effective way of handling long context for patch retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAFix: History-Augmented Large Language Models for Bug Fixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09135v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have explored the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various Software Engineering (SE) tasks, such as code generation and bug fixing. However, these approaches typically rely on the context data from the current snapshot of the project, overlooking the potential of rich historical data residing in real-world software repositories. Additionally, the impact of prompt styles on LLM performance for SE tasks within a historical context remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose HAFix, which stands for History-Augmented LLMs on Bug Fixing, a novel approach that leverages seven individual historical heuristics associated with bugs and aggregates the results of these heuristics (HAFix-Agg) to enhance LLMs' bug-fixing capabilities. To empirically evaluate HAFix, we employ three Code LLMs (i.e., Code Llama, DeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite models) on 51 single-line Python bugs from BugsInPy and 116 single-line Java bugs from Defects4J. Our evaluation demonstrates that multiple HAFix heuristics achieve statistically significant improvements compared to a non-historical baseline inspired by GitHub Copilot. Furthermore, the aggregated HAFix variant HAFix-Agg achieves substantial improvements by combining the complementary strengths of individual heuristics, increasing bug-fixing rates by an average of 45.05% on BugsInPy and 49.92% on Defects4J relative to the corresponding baseline. Moreover, within the context of historical heuristics, we identify the Instruction prompt style as the most effective template compared to the InstructionLabel and InstructionMask for LLMs in bug fixing. Finally, we evaluate the cost of HAFix in terms of inference time and token usage, and provide a pragmatic trade-off analysis of the cost and bug-fixing performance, offering valuable insights for the practical deployment of our approach in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expan...</summary><p>Expanded HAFix evaluation to include two datasets (BugsInPy, Defects4J) and three LLMs (CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder-V2)</p></details> |

Although prior studies have examined task-specific applications, the phase-specific effects of LLM assistance on the efficiency of code review processes remain underexplored. This research investigates the effect of GPT on GitHub pull request (PR) workflows, with a focus on reducing resolution time, optimizing phase-specific performance, and assisting developers. We curated a dataset of 25,473 PRs from 9,254 GitHub projects and identified GPT-assisted PRs using a semi-automated heuristic approach that combines keyword-based detection, regular expression filtering, and manual verification until achieving 95% labeling accuracy. We then applied statistical modeling, including multiple linear regression and Mann-Whitney U test, to evaluate differences between GPT-assisted and non-assisted PRs, both at the overall resolution level and across distinct review phases. Our research has revealed that early adoption of GPT can substantially boost the effectiveness of the PR process, leading to considerable time savings at various stages. Our findings suggest that GPT-assisted PRs reduced median resolution time by more than 60% (9 hours compared to 23 hours for non-assisted PRs). We discovered that utilizing GPT can reduce the review time by 33% and the waiting time before acceptance by 87%. Analyzing a sample dataset of 300 GPT-assisted PRs, we discovered that developers predominantly use GPT for code optimization (60%), bug fixing (26%), and documentation updates (12%). This research sheds light on the impact of the GPT model on the code review process, offering actionable insights for software teams seeking to enhance workflows and promote seamless collaboration.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dissecting the SWE-Bench Leaderboards: Profiling Submitters and Architectures of LLM- and Agent-Based Repair Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17208v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards -- SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified -- have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (79 entries) and Verified (99 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 80 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strengthening Programming Comprehension in Large Language Models through Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12620v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive results on diverse code-related tasks, benefiting from large-scale training and instruction tuning. However, studies reveal that their grasp of fundamental programming concepts, such as data flow and control flow, remains shallow, leading to fragile performance when code requires deeper reasoning. This limitation restricts the practical adoption of LLMs in real-world software development. To address this issue, this work introduces a counterfactual code augmentation framework combined with concept-aware tuning, designed to guide LLMs toward stronger conceptual understanding. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Code Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21569v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-has reshaped Software Engineering (SE) by enabling the automation of tasks such as code generation, bug detection, and repair. However, these models require significant computational resources for training and fine-tuning, posing challenges for real-world adoption in resource-constrained environments. To address this, the research community has increasingly turned to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)-a class of techniques that enables the adaptation of large models by updating only a small subset of parameters, rather than the entire model. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we examine the growing application of PEFT techniques-across a wide range of software engineering tasks. We analyze how these methods are used to optimize various deep learning (DL) architectures, focusing on their impact on both performance and efficiency. Our study synthesizes findings from 28 peer-reviewed papers, identifying patterns in configuration strategies and adaptation trade-offs. The outcome of this review is a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes PEFT usage by task type, distinguishing between generative (e.g., Code Summarization) and non-generative (e.g., Code Clone Detection) scenarios. Our findings aim to inform future research and guide the practical deployment of PEFT in sustainable, AI-powered software development. Our artifacts are publicly available at https://github.com/alvi75/SLR-PEFT</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Agentic Programming: A Survey of Techniques, Challenges, and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11126v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agentic programming is an emerging paradigm in which large language models (LLMs) autonomously plan, execute, and interact with external tools like compilers, debuggers, and version control systems to iteratively perform complex software development tasks. Unlike conventional code generation tools, agentic systems are capable of decomposing high-level goals, coordinating multi-step processes, and adapting their behavior based on intermediate feedback. These capabilities are transforming the software development practice. As this emerging field evolves rapidly, there is a need to define its scope, consolidate its technical foundations, and identify open research challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive and timely review of AI agentic programming. We introduce a taxonomy of agent behaviors and system architectures, and examine core techniques including planning, memory and context management, tool integration, and execution monitoring. We also analyze existing benchmarks and evaluation methodologies used to assess coding agent performance. Our study identifies several key challenges, including limitations in handling long context, a lack of persistent memory across tasks, and concerns around safety, alignment with user intent, and collaboration with human developers. We discuss emerging opportunities to improve the reliability, adaptability, and transparency of agentic systems. By synthesizing recent advances and outlining future directions, this survey aims to provide a foundation for research and development in building the next generation of intelligent and trustworthy AI coding agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion is a code repair operator and generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11110v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code diffusion models generate code by iteratively removing noise from the latent representation of a code snippet. During later steps of the diffusion process, when the code snippet has almost converged, differences between discrete representations of these snippets look like last-mile repairs applied to broken or incomplete code. We evaluate the extent to which this resemblance can be exploited to leverage pre-trained code diffusion models for the problem of last-mile repair by considering two applications with significant potential. First, we can leverage the diffusion model for last-mile repair by adding noise to a broken code snippet and resuming the diffusion process. Second, we can leverage the diffusion model to generate arbitrary amount of training data for last-mile repair tasks (that are computationally more efficient) by sampling an intermediate program (input) and the final program (output) from the diffusion process. We perform experiments on 3 domains (Python, Excel and PowerShell) to evaluate applications, as well as analyze properties.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[AlgoTune: Can Language Models Speed Up General-Purpose Numerical Programs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15887v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Prompt to Pipeline: Large Language Models for Scientific Workflow Development in Bioinformatics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20122v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific Workflow Systems such as Galaxy and Nextflow are essential for scalable, reproducible, and automated bioinformatics analyses. However, developing and understanding scientific workflows remains challenging for many domain scientists due to the complexity of tool/module selection, infrastructure requirements, and limited programming expertise. This study explores whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and DeepSeek-V3 can assist in generating accurate, complete, and usable bioinformatics workflows. We evaluate a set of representative workflows covering tasks such as RNA-seq, SNP analysis, and DNA methylation across both Galaxy (graphical) and Nextflow (script-based) platforms. To simulate realistic usage, we adopt a tiered prompting strategy: each workflow is first generated using an instruction-only prompt; if the output is incomplete or incorrect, we escalate to a role-based prompt, and finally to chain-of-thought prompting if needed. The generated workflows are evaluated against community-curated baselines from the Galaxy Training Network and nf-core, using criteria including correctness, completeness, tool appropriateness, and executability. Results show that LLMs exhibit strong potential in workflow development. Gemini 2.5 Flash produced the most accurate and user-friendly workflows in Galaxy, while DeepSeek-V3 excelled in Nextflow pipeline generation. GPT-4o performed nicely with structured prompts. Prompting strategy significantly influenced output quality, with role-based and chain-of-thought prompts enhancing correctness and completeness. Overall, LLMs can reduce the cognitive and technical barriers to workflow development, making SWSs more accessible to novice and expert users. This work highlights the practical utility of LLMs and provides actionable insights for integrating them into real-world bioinformatics workflow design.</p></details> | 46pages |
| **[CodeJudgeBench: Benchmarking LLM-as-a-Judge for Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10535v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking. However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved judge performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mattymchen/codejudgebench</p></details> |
| **[Benchmark Dataset Generation and Evaluation for Excel Formula Repair with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11715v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Excel is a pervasive yet often complex tool, particularly for novice users, where runtime errors arising from logical mistakes or misinterpretations of functions pose a significant challenge. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising assistance by explaining formula errors, the automated correction of these semantic runtime errors remains an open problem. A primary challenge to advancing models for such scenarios is the severe lack of high-quality, comprehensive datasets for training and rigorous evaluation. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach for constructing a benchmark dataset specifically designed for Excel formula repair. We propose a data generation pipeline, which leverages a small set of curated seed samples from online forums to synthetically expand the dataset. Our pipeline integrates few-shot prompting with LLMs and employs a robust \textit{LLM-as-a-Judge} validation framework, combined with execution-based checks to ensure the correctness and semantic fidelity of the generated data. This process produced a benchmark dataset of 618 high-quality samples, covering common runtime errors. Furthermore, we propose a context-aware baseline technique for Excel formula repair that utilizes LLMs to leverage both the faulty formula, and relevant spreadsheet context. We evaluate the performance of various LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Phi-3, Mistral) on our newly generated benchmark using execution-based metrics. Our analysis demonstrates the dataset's quality through manual annotation and provides insights into error and function distributions. The proposed generation methodology is highly scalable and can be readily adapted to create evaluation benchmarks for similar code repair tasks in other low-resource programming languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the KDD workshop on Evaluation and Trustworthiness of Agentic and Generative AI Models</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Solidity Evolution Gaps: An LLM-Enhanced Approach for Smart Contract Compilation Error Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10517v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92% of compilation errors. To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek) and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts. Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration. Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enabling Generic Robot Skill Implementation Using Object Oriented Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10497v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing, maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result, many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa Motoman GP4.</p></details> | <details><summary>34th ...</summary><p>34th International Conference on Robotics in Alpe-Adria-Danube Region (RAAD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[VERCATION: Precise Vulnerable Open-source Software Version Identification based on Static Analysis and LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07321v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source software (OSS) has experienced a surge in popularity, attributed to its collaborative development model and cost-effective nature. However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities. Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and extract the code features involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules. They then use code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions. These methods are hindered by imprecision due to (1) the exclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of code clone detection. This paper presents VERCATION, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++. VERCATION combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. It then backtracks historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code. We propose code clone detection based on expanded and normalized ASTs to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling the identification of the vulnerable versions between the vulnerability-fixing commit and the vic. We curate a dataset linking 122 OSS vulnerabilities and 1,211 versions to evaluate VERCATION. On this dataset, our approach achieves an F1 score of 93.1%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, VERCATION detected 202 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars. We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly, our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains practical.</p></details> |  |

Our results indicate that students found all implemented feedback types helpful, with automatic testing ranked as the most useful. We also introduce a dataset comprising 7201 correct and incorrect Prolog submissions, along with 200 manually annotated programs labeled with bug types and corresponding corrections. Finally, we explore student preferences for which types of feedback they would most like to see implemented in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>The u...</summary><p>The updated version adds the submission dataset description and analysis, changes the template and makes several other minor changes</p></details> |
| **[SaraCoder: Orchestrating Semantic and Structural Cues for Profit-Oriented Repository-Level Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10068v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis. Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level code completion systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inclusive Employment Pathways: Career Success Factors for Autistic Individuals in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09680v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research has highlighted the valuable contributions of autistic individuals in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector, particularly in areas such as software development, testing, and cybersecurity. Their strengths in information processing, attention to detail, innovative thinking, and commitment to high-quality outcomes in the ICT domain are well-documented. However, despite their potential, autistic individuals often face barriers in Software Engineering (SE) roles due to a lack of personalised tools, complex work environments, non-inclusive recruitment practices, limited co-worker support, challenging social dynamics and so on. Motivated by the ethical framework of the neurodiversity movement and the success of pioneering initiatives like the Dandelion program, corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in the ICT sector has increasingly focused on autistic talent. This movement fundamentally reframes challenges not as individual deficits but as failures of environments designed for a neurotypical majority. Despite this progress, there is no synthesis of knowledge reporting the full pathway from software engineering education through to sustainable workplace inclusion. To address this, we conducted a Systematic Review of 30 studies and identified 18 success factors grouped into four thematic categories: (1) Software Engineering Education, (2) Career and Employment Training, (3) Work Environment, and (4) Tools and Assistive Technologies. Our findings offer evidence-based recommendations for educational institutions, employers, organisations, and tool developers to enhance the inclusion of autistic individuals in SE. These include strategies for inclusive meeting and collaboration practices, accessible and structured work environments, clear role and responsibility definitions, and the provision of tailored workplace accommodations.</p></details> |  |

GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoCodeBench: Large Language Models are Automatic Code Benchmark Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09101v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second, most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising 3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity, diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://autocodebench.github.io/</p></details> |

However, as external components, CoT models are particularly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which existing defense mechanisms often fail to detect effectively. To address this challenge, we propose GUARD, a novel dual-agent defense framework specifically designed to counter CoT backdoor attacks in neural code generation. GUARD integrates two core components: GUARD-Judge, which identifies suspicious CoT steps and potential triggers through comprehensive analysis, and GUARD-Repair, which employs a retrieval-augmented generation approach to regenerate secure CoT steps for identified anomalies. Experimental results show that GUARD effectively mitigates attacks while maintaining generation quality, advancing secure code generation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SEKE 2025</p></details> |

In contrast, programmers working in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC, which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the applicability of formal verification to Python programs. In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, these systems reflect and amplify bias from the data used during training and testing, potentially resulting in biased behavior and inaccurate decisions. For instance, having different misclassification rates between white and black sub-populations. However, effectively and efficiently identifying and correcting biased behavior in DNNs is a challenge. This paper introduces FairFLRep, an automated fairness-aware fault localization and repair technique that identifies and corrects potentially bias-inducing neurons in DNN classifiers. FairFLRep focuses on adjusting neuron weights associated with sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, that contribute to unfair decisions. By analyzing the input-output relationships within the network, FairFLRep corrects neurons responsible for disparities in predictive quality parity. We evaluate FairFLRep on four image classification datasets using two DNN classifiers, and four tabular datasets with a DNN model. The results show that FairFLRep consistently outperforms existing methods in improving fairness while preserving accuracy. An ablation study confirms the importance of considering fairness during both fault localization and repair stages. Our findings also show that FairFLRep is more efficient than the baseline approaches in repairing the network.</p></details> |  |

However, writing high-quality unit tests remains a time-consuming task for developers in practice. More recently, the application of large language models (LLMs) in automated unit test generation has demonstrated promising results. Existing approaches primarily focus on interpreted programming languages (e.g., Java), while mature solutions tailored to compiled programming languages like C++ are yet to be explored. The intricate language features of C++, such as pointers, templates, and virtual functions, pose particular challenges for LLMs in generating both executable and high-coverage unit tests. To tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper introduces CITYWALK, a novel LLM-based framework for C++ unit test generation. CITYWALK enhances LLMs by providing a comprehensive understanding of the dependency relationships within the project under test via program analysis. Furthermore, CITYWALK incorporates language-specific knowledge about C++ derived from project documentation and empirical observations, significantly improving the correctness of the LLM-generated unit tests. We implement CITYWALK by employing the widely popular LLM GPT-4o. The experimental results show that CITYWALK outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on a collection of ten popular C++ projects. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of CITYWALK in generating high-quality C++ unit tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, to appear in the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same redzone setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07468v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we present SmartonAI, an AI-assisted interaction system that integrates large language models into the EDA workflow, enabling natural language communication, intelligent task decomposition, and contextual plugin execution. SmartonAI consists of two main components: a Chat Plugin that breaks down user instructions into subtasks and retrieves tailored documentation, and a OneCommandLine Plugin that recommends and executes relevant plugins based on user intent. The system supports multilingual interaction and adapts to user feedback through incremental learning. Preliminary results suggest that SmartonAI significantly reduces onboarding time and enhances productivity, representing a promising step toward generalizable AI-assisted interaction paradigms for complex software systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 Workshop on New In Machine Learning (NewInML), 9 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

However, current evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically analyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within these systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative programmable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this benchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with two LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%. Through in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure causes aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution issues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose actionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis capabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides an empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous agent systems in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE 2025 NIER</p></details> |

However, a comprehensive investigation into VR accessibility for users with disabilities is still lacking. To fill this gap, this study analyzes user reviews from the Meta and Steam stores of VR apps, focusing on the reported issues affecting users with disabilities. We applied selection criteria to 1,367,419 reviews from the top 40, the 20 most popular, and the 40 lowest-rated VR applications on both platforms. In total, 1,076 (0.078%) VR accessibility reviews referenced various disabilities across 100 VR applications. These applications were categorized into Action, Sports, Social, Puzzle, Horror, and Simulation, with Action receiving the highest number of accessibility related-reviews. We identified 16 different types of disabilities across six categories. Furthermore, we examined the causes of accessibility issues as reported by users with disabilities. Overall, VR accessibility reviews were predominantly under-supported.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 28.07%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[RUM: Rule+LLM-Based Comprehensive Assessment on Testing Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12922v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past eight years, the META method has served as a multidimensional testing skill assessment system in the National College Student Contest on Software Testing, successfully assessing over 100,000 students' testing skills. However, META is primarily limited to the objective assessment of test scripts, lacking the ability to automatically assess subjective aspects such as test case and test report. To address this limitation, this paper proposes RUM, a comprehensive assessment approach that combines rules and large language models (LLMs). RUM achieves a comprehensive assessment by rapidly processing objective indicators through rules while utilizing LLMs for in-depth subjective analysis of test case documents, test scripts, and test reports. The experimental results show that compared to traditional manual testing skill assessment, RUM improves assessment efficiency by 80.77\% and reduces costs by 97.38\%, while maintaining high accuracy and consistency of assessment. By applying RUM on the contest on software testing, we find that it not only enhances the efficiency and scalability of skill assessment in software testing education, but also provides teachers with more comprehensive and objective evidence for student ability assessment, facilitating personalized teaching and learning. This study offers new insights into the assessment of testing skills, which are expected to promote further development in test process optimization and software quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards -- SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified -- have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (79 entries) and Verified (99 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 80 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChangePrism: Visualizing the Essence of Code Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12649v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the changes made by developers when they submit a pull request and/or perform a commit on a repository is a crucial activity in software maintenance and evolution. The common way to review changes relies on examining code diffs, where textual differences between two file versions are highlighted in red and green to indicate additions and deletions of lines. This can be cumbersome for developers, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive overview of all changes in a commit. Moreover, certain types of code changes can be particularly significant and may warrant differentiation from standard modifications to enhance code comprehension. We present a novel visualization approach supported by a tool named ChangePrism, which provides a way to better understand code changes. The tool comprises two components: extraction, which retrieves code changes and relevant information from the git history, and visualization, which offers both general and detailed views of code changes in commits. The general view provides an overview of different types of code changes across commits, while the detailed view displays the exact changes in the source code for each commit.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, VISSOFT 2025</p></details> |

However, studies reveal that their grasp of fundamental programming concepts, such as data flow and control flow, remains shallow, leading to fragile performance when code requires deeper reasoning. This limitation restricts the practical adoption of LLMs in real-world software development. To address this issue, this work introduces a counterfactual code augmentation framework combined with concept-aware tuning, designed to guide LLMs toward stronger conceptual understanding. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL environment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models (LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom reward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization, configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios. Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic tuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across various real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in diverse environments. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/LHY-24/OS-R1.</p></details> |  |

Bugs in widely used deep learning APIs can propagate to downstream systems, causing serious consequences. While existing fuzzing techniques detect bugs through intra-framework testing across hardware backends (CPU vs. GPU), they may miss bugs that manifest identically across backends and thus escape detection under these strategies. To address this problem, we propose XAMT, a cross-framework fuzzing method that tests deep learning libraries by matching and comparing functionally equivalent APIs across different frameworks. XAMT matches APIs using similarity-based rules based on names, descriptions, and parameter structures. It then aligns inputs and applies variance-guided differential testing to detect bugs. We evaluated XAMT on five popular frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and JAX. XAMT matched 839 APIs and identified 238 matched API groups, and detected 17 bugs, 12 of which have been confirmed. Our results show that XAMT uncovers bugs undetectable by intra-framework testing, especially those that manifest consistently across backends. XAMT offers a complementary approach to existing methods and offers a new perspective on the testing of deep learning libraries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Analysis of MCP Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12538v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a universal standard that enables AI agents to seamlessly connect with external tools, significantly enhancing their functionality. However, while MCP brings notable benefits, it also introduces significant vulnerabilities, such as Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where hidden malicious instructions exploit the sycophancy of large language models (LLMs) to manipulate agent behavior. Despite these risks, current academic research on MCP security remains limited, with most studies focusing on narrow or qualitative analyses that fail to capture the diversity of real-world threats. To address this gap, we present the MCP Attack Library (MCPLIB), which categorizes and implements 31 distinct attack methods under four key classifications: direct tool injection, indirect tool injection, malicious user attacks, and LLM inherent attack. We further conduct a quantitative analysis of the efficacy of each attack. Our experiments reveal key insights into MCP vulnerabilities, including agents' blind reliance on tool descriptions, sensitivity to file-based attacks, chain attacks exploiting shared context, and difficulty distinguishing external data from executable commands. These insights, validated through attack experiments, underscore the urgency for robust defense strategies and informed MCP design. Our contributions include 1) constructing a comprehensive MCP attack taxonomy, 2) introducing a unified attack framework MCPLIB, and 3) conducting empirical vulnerability analysis to enhance MCP security mechanisms. This work provides a foundational framework, supporting the secure evolution of MCP ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

Satisfying users' demands can benefit the product from both competitiveness and user satisfaction. Feature requests have seen a rise in interest in the past few years and the amount of research has been growing. However, the diversity in the research topics suggests the need for their collective analysis to identify the challenges and opportunities so as to promote new advances in the future. In this work, following a defined process and a search protocol, we provide a systematic overview of the research area by searching and categorizing relevant studies. We select and analyze 131 primary studies using descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis methods. We classify the studies into different topics and group them from the perspective of requirements engineering activities. We investigate open tools as well as datasets for future research. In addition, we identify several key challenges and opportunities, such as: (1) ensuring the quality of feature requests, (2) improving their specification and validation, and (3) developing high-quality benchmarks for large language model-driven tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[System-driven Interactive Design Support for Cloud Architecture: A Qualitative User Experience Study with Novice Engineers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12385v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud architecture design presents significant challenges due to the necessity of clarifying ambiguous requirements and systematically addressing complex trade-offs, especially for novice engineers with limited cloud experience. While recent advances in the use of AI tools have broadened available options, system-driven approaches that offer explicit guidance and step-by-step information management may be especially effective in supporting novices during the design process. This study qualitatively examines the experiences of 60 novice engineers using such a system-driven cloud design support tool. The findings indicate that structured and proactive system guidance helps novices engage more effectively in architectural design, especially when addressing tasks where knowledge and experience gaps are most critical. For example, participants found it easier to create initial architectures and did not need to craft prompts themselves. In addition, participants reported that the ability to simulate and compare multiple architecture options enabled them to deepen their understanding of cloud design principles and trade-offs, demonstrating the educational value of system-driven support. The study also identifies areas for improvement, including more adaptive information delivery tailored to user expertise, mechanisms for validating system outputs, and better integration with implementation workflows such as infrastructure-as-code generation and deployment guidance. Addressing these aspects can further enhance the educational and practical value of system-driven support tools for cloud architecture design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Systematic Failures of LLMs in Verifying Code Against Natural Language Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12358v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software development, widely used for requirements engineering, code generation and review tasks. Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system code implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code robustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably determine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions, which is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time, our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with requirements. We also offer novel insights and practical guidance for effective use of LLMs in automated code review and task-oriented agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which fail to adequately represent how developers actually utilize LLMs' code generation capabilities or clarify the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To bridge this gap, our study investigates the characteristics of LLM-generated code and its corresponding projects hosted on GitHub. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot are the most frequently utilized for generating code on GitHub. In contrast, there is very little code generated by other LLMs on GitHub. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code are often small and less known, led by individuals or small teams. Despite this, most projects are continuously evolving and improving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot is mainly utilized for generating Python, Java, and TypeScript scripts for data processing and transformation. C/C++ and JavaScript code generation focuses on algorithm and data structure implementation and user interface code. Most ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code snippets are relatively short and exhibit low complexity. (4) Compared to human-written code, ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code exists in a small proportion of projects and generally undergoes fewer modifications. Additionally, modifications due to bugs are even fewer, ranging from just 3% to 8% across different languages. (5) Most comments on ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code lack detailed information, often only stating the code's origin without mentioning prompts, human modifications, or testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

These parts must work together seamlessly to satisfy the overall system requirements. To verify such complex systems, we have developed a non-intrusive coordination framework capable of performing formal analysis of heterogeneous parts that exchange data and include real-time capabilities. The framework utilizes a linguistic extension, which is implemented as a central broker and a domain-specific language for the integration of heterogeneous languages and coordination of parts. Moreover, abstract rule templates are reified as language adapters for non-intrusive communications with the broker. The framework is implemented using rewriting logic (Maude), and its applicability is demonstrated by verifying certain correctness properties of a heterogeneous road-rail crossing system.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors accepted version of a paper to be published in MODELS-2025, DOI: TBD</p></details> |

This paper examines the concepts, principles, implementation, and prospects of Ethereum based gambling DApps. First, we outline the concept and operational principles of gambling DApps. These DApps are blockchain based online lottery platforms. They utilize smart contracts to manage the entire lottery process, including issuance, betting, drawing, and prize distribution. Being decentralized, lottery DApps operate without central oversight, unlike traditional lotteries. This ensures fairness and eliminates control by any single entity. Automated smart contract execution further reduces management costs, increases profitability, and enhances game transparency and credibility. Next, we analyze an existing Ethereum based gambling DApp, detailing its technical principles, implementation, operational status, vulnerabilities, and potential solutions. We then elaborate on the implementation of lottery DApps. Smart contracts automate the entire lottery process including betting, drawing, and prize distribution. Although developing lottery DApps requires technical expertise, the expanding Ethereum ecosystem provides growing tools and frameworks, lowering development barriers. Finally, we discuss current limitations and prospects of lottery DApps. As blockchain technology and smart contracts evolve, lottery DApps are positioned to significantly transform the online lottery industry. Advantages like decentralization, automation, and transparency will likely drive broader future adoption.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous studies that conduct observational research in controlled and simulated environments, we analyze extensive, first-hand user reviews of AI coding assistants, which capture developers' authentic perspectives and experiences drawn directly from their actual day-to-day work contexts. We identify 1,085 AI coding assistants from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Although they only account for 1.64% of all extensions, we observe a surge in these assistants: over 90% of them are released within the past two years. We then manually analyze the user reviews sampled from 32 AI coding assistants that have sufficient installations and reviews to construct a comprehensive taxonomy of user concerns and feedback about these assistants.

| **[Understanding LLM-Centric Challenges for Deep Learning Frameworks: An Empirical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13114v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress across a wide range of real-world applications. Realizing such models requires substantial system-level support. Deep learning (DL) frameworks provide this foundation by enabling efficient model construction, distributed execution, and optimized deployment. The large parameter scale and extended execution cycles impose exacting demands on deep learning frameworks, particularly in terms of scalability, stability, and efficiency. Therefore, poor usability, limited functionality, and subtle bugs in DL frameworks may hinder development efficiency and cause severe failures or resource waste. However, a fundamental question has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies, i.e., what challenges do DL frameworks face in supporting LLMs? To answer this question, we analyze issue reports from three major DL frameworks (i.e., MindSpore, PyTorch, and TensorFlow) and eight associated LLM toolkits such as Megatron. Based on a manual review of these reports, we construct a taxonomy that captures LLM-centric framework bugs, user requirements, and user questions. We then refine and enrich this taxonomy through interviews with 11 LLM users and eight DL framework developers. Based on the constructed taxonomy and findings summarized from interviews, our study further reveals key technical challenges and mismatches between LLM user needs and developer priorities.</p></details> | 46 pages, 14 figures |
| **[LinkAnchor: An Autonomous LLM-Based Agent for Issue-to-Commit Link Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12232v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue-to-commit link recovery plays an important role in software traceability and improves project management. However, it remains a challenging task. A study on GitHub shows that only 42.2% of the issues are correctly linked to their commits. This highlights the potential for further development and research in this area. Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based approaches, and with the recent development of large language models, researchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer from two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows and cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit histories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most methods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single issue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This quickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of thousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the first autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery. The lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access the rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files, without exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most relevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically pinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible candidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art issue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all our case study projects. We also publicly release LinkAnchor as a ready-to-use tool, along with our replication package. LinkAnchor is designed and tested for GitHub and Jira, and is easily extendable to other platforms.</p></details> |  |

Especially due to the diversity and complexity of developers, many plugin systems lack adequate regulation. As ChatGPT has become a popular large-scale language modelling platform, its plugin system is also gradually developing, and the open platform provides creators with the opportunity to upload plugins covering a wide range of application scenarios. However, current research and discussions mostly focus on the security issues of the ChatGPT model itself, while ignoring the possible security risks posed by the plugin system. This study aims to analyse the security of plugins in the ChatGPT plugin shop, reveal its major security vulnerabilities, and propose corresponding improvements.</p></details> | Master's thesis |

The Meta Quest VR platform, driven by Meta, has democratized VR app publishing and attracted millions of users worldwide. However, as the number of published apps grows, there is a notable lack of robust headless tools for user interface (UI) exploration and user event testing. To address this need, we present AUTOVR, an automatic framework for dynamic UI and user event interaction in VR apps built on the Unity Engine. Unlike conventional Android and GUI testers, AUTOVR analyzes the app's internal binary to reveal hidden events, resolves generative event dependencies, and utilizes them for comprehensive exploration of VR apps. Using sensitive data exposure as a performance metric, we compare AUTOVR with Android Monkey, a widely used headless Android GUI stress testing tool. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates AUTOVR's superior performance, triggering an order of magnitude of more sensitive data exposures and significantly enhancing the privacy of VR apps.</p></details> | <details><summary>USENI...</summary><p>USENIX Security 2025, 19 Pages, 14 Figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

Several approaches have been proposed to support understanding such modifications by separating them into those two parts. Such refactoring-aware approaches are expected to be particularly effective when the behavior-preserving parts can be decomposed into a sequence of more primitive behavior-preserving operations, such as refactorings, but this has not been explored. In this paper, as an initial validation, we quantify how much of the behavior-preserving modifications can be decomposed into refactoring operations using a dataset of functionally-equivalent method pairs. As a result, when using an existing refactoring detector, only 33.9% of the changes could be identified as refactoring operations. In contrast, when including 67 newly defined functionally-equivalent operations, the coverage increased by over 128%. Further investigation into the remaining unexplained differences was conducted, suggesting improvement opportunities.</p></details> | <details><summary>(C) 2...</summary><p>(C) 2025 IEEE.

| **[Clean Code, Better Models: Enhancing LLM Performance with Smell-Cleaned Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11958v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in code-related tasks. However, most research focuses on improving the output quality of LLMs (e.g., correctness), and less attention has been paid to the LLM input (e.g., the training code quality). Given that code smells are widely existed in practice and can negatively impact software maintainability and readability, this study takes the first systematic research to assess and improve dataset quality in terms of code smells. In this work, we first conduct a preliminary study to explore the presence of code smells in a popular benchmark dataset (i.e., CodeSearchNet-Python}) and evaluate the output of several popular LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama, and MagiCoder), revealing that code smell issues extensively exist in LLM's input (e.g., benchmark dataset) and output (e.g., generated code). We then conduct our systematic research by taking three main steps: Firstly, we propose an LLM-based code smell cleaning tool, named SmellCC, which automatically refactors and removes code smells. To evaluate the correctness of the code refactoring, we construct a test set of 50 repositories sourced from the CodeSearchNet-Python benchmark for functional testing. Then we apply our curated smell-cleaned dataset to fine-tune two LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen-Coder) to explore their potential for generating high-quality code. Thirdly, we investigate the impact of code smells on two downstream tasks: code completion and code search. Lastly, we derive several actionable implications for software engineering researchers and industry practitioners from our findings.</p></details> |  |

While CI/CD tooling has matured, human decision points interpreting flaky tests, choosing rollback strategies, tuning feature flags, and deciding when to promote a canary remain major sources of latency and operational toil. We propose AI-Augmented CI/CD Pipelines, where large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents act as policy-bounded co-pilots and progressively as decision makers. We contribute: (1) a reference architecture for embedding agentic decision points into CI/CD, (2) a decision taxonomy and policy-as-code guardrail pattern, (3) a trust-tier framework for staged autonomy, (4) an evaluation methodology using DevOps Research and Assessment ( DORA) metrics and AI-specific indicators, and (5) a detailed industrial-style case study migrating a React 19 microservice to an AI-augmented pipeline. We discuss ethics, verification, auditability, and threats to validity, and chart a roadmap for verifiable autonomy in production delivery systems.</p></details> | 13 Pages |

By combining a domain-specific LLM trained with synthetically generated data, a custom compiler for structural verification, rule enforcement, code fixing capabilities, and advanced retrieval mechanisms, our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our framework addresses the challenges of data scarcity and hallucination errors in LLMs, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in specialized engineering domains. We evaluate our framework on multiple benchmarks and show that it outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy and reliability. Our work sets a new precedent for the application of LLMs in EDA and paves the way for future innovations in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Autonomy: Preventing Failures in AI-Driven Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11824v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has revolutionized code generation, enabling unprecedented productivity through promptware and autonomous AI agents. However, this transformation introduces significant risks, including insecure code generation, hallucinated outputs, irreversible actions, and a lack of transparency and accountability. Incidents like the Replit database deletion underscore the urgent need for robust safety and governance mechanisms. This paper comprehensively analyzes the inherent challenges of LLM-assisted code generation, such as vulnerability inheritance, overtrust, misinterpretation, and the absence of standardized validation and rollback protocols. To address these, we propose the SAFE-AI Framework, a holistic approach emphasizing Safety, Auditability, Feedback, and Explainability. The framework integrates guardrails, sandboxing, runtime verification, risk-aware logging, human-in-the-loop systems, and explainable AI techniques to mitigate risks while fostering trust and compliance. We introduce a novel taxonomy of AI behaviors categorizing suggestive, generative, autonomous, and destructive actions to guide risk assessment and oversight. Additionally, we identify open problems, including the lack of standardized benchmarks for code specific hallucinations and autonomy levels, and propose future research directions for hybrid verification, semantic guardrails, and proactive governance tools. Through detailed comparisons of autonomy control, prompt engineering, explainability, and governance frameworks, this paper provides a roadmap for responsible AI integration in software engineering, aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and Canada's AIDA to ensure safe, transparent, and accountable AI-driven development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Cuts: Enhance Active Learning for Vulnerability Detection by Pruning Hard-to-Learn Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20444v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability detection is crucial for identifying security weaknesses in software systems. However, training effective machine learning models for this task is often constrained by the high cost and expertise required for data annotation. Active learning is a promising approach to mitigate this challenge by intelligently selecting the most informative data points for labeling. This paper proposes a novel method to significantly enhance the active learning process by using dataset maps. Our approach systematically identifies samples that are hard-to-learn for a model and integrates this information to create a more sophisticated sample selection strategy. Unlike traditional active learning methods that focus primarily on model uncertainty, our strategy enriches the selection process by considering learning difficulty, allowing the active learner to more effectively pinpoint truly informative examples. The experimental results show that our approach can improve F1 score over random selection by 61.54% (DeepGini) and 45.91% (K-Means) and outperforms standard active learning by 8.23% (DeepGini) and 32.65% (K-Means) for CodeBERT on the Big-Vul dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating dataset maps for optimizing sample selection in vulnerability detection. Furthermore, our approach also enhances model robustness, improves sample selection by filtering hard-to-learn data, and stabilizes active learning performance across iterations. By analyzing the characteristics of these outliers, we provide insights for future improvements in dataset construction, making vulnerability detection more reliable and cost-effective.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-LiFT: Improving LLM-based Decompiler Backend via Code Quality-driven Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10125v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the key tools in many security tasks, decompilers reconstruct human-readable source code from binaries. Yet, despite recent advances, their outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and remain difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanced decompiler-LLM pipeline with a fine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: preserving accuracy while improving readability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality assessment system to score the decompiled source code from multiple aspects, and use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best output during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the quality of 68.2% of all the functions produced by the native decompiler.</p></details> |  |

Network Science can provide methods to study such networks. In particular, temporal network analysis is a branch of Network Science that analyzes networks evolving with time. In microservice systems, temporal networks can arise if we examine the architecture of the system across releases or monitor a deployed system using tracing. In this research summary paper, I discuss the challenges in obtaining temporal networks from microservice systems and analyzing them with the temporal network methods. In particular, the most complete temporal network that we could obtain contains 7 time instances and 42 microservices, which limits the potential analysis that could be applied.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging AI Innovation and Healthcare Needs: Lessons Learned from Incorporating Modern NLP at The BC Cancer Registry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09991v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations, generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health outcomes.</p></details> |  |

This shift marks the emergence of Human-AI Experience in Integrated Development Environment (in-IDE HAX), a field that explores the evolving dynamics of Human-Computer Interaction in AI-assisted coding environments. Despite rapid adoption, research on in-IDE HAX remains fragmented, which highlights the need for a unified overview of current practices, challenges, and opportunities. To provide a structured overview of existing research, we conduct a systematic literature review of 90 studies, summarizing current findings and outlining areas for further investigation. We organize key insights from reviewed studies into three aspects: Impact, Design, and Quality of AI-based systems inside IDEs. Impact findings show that AI-assisted coding enhances developer productivity but also introduces challenges, such as verification overhead and over-reliance. Design studies show that effective interfaces surface context, provide explanations and transparency of suggestion, and support user control. Quality studies document risks in correctness, maintainability, and security. For future research, priorities include productivity studies, design of assistance, and audit of AI-generated code. The agenda calls for larger and longer evaluations, stronger audit and verification assets, broader coverage across the software life cycle, and adaptive assistance under user control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) special issue Human-Centered AI for Software Engineering (HumanAISE), 37 pages, 7 figure</p></details> |
| **[TRACY: Benchmarking Execution Efficiency of LLM-Based Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11468v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic code translation is a fundamental task in modern software development. While the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved the correctness of code translation, the critical dimension of execution efficiency remains overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce TRACY, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the execution efficiency of LLM-translated code. TRACY is constructed through an LLM-driven two-stage pipeline: an initial stage generates a suite of stress tests to amplify performance differences, followed by an efficiency-oriented task pruning stage that isolates the efficiency-distinguishing tasks. The resulting benchmark comprises 1,011 code translation tasks across C++, Java, and Python, each accompanied by an average of 22.1 verified reference translations and 10 computationally demanding tests. Our extensive evaluation of 26 representative LLMs reveals that even top-tier LLMs struggle to consistently produce efficient code translations. For instance, Claude-4-think, the leading model for correctness, ranks eighth overall when time efficiency is taken into account, surpassed by several smaller open-source models. We further pinpoint that algorithmic flaws and improper resource handling are the most detrimental, causing a median time slowdown of 5.6$\times$ and memory increase of 12.0$\times$, respectively. Our work underscores the necessity of jointly optimizing for correctness and efficiency in future LLM-based code translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defects4Log: Benchmarking LLMs for Logging Code Defect Detection and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11305v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic Benchmarking on Typical Software Engineering Dilemmas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11278v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human cognitive biases in software engineering can lead to costly errors. While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases? To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions. To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88--99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning and LLM-as-a-judge validation. It also verifies that the embedded biases are both harmful and undetectable by logic-based, unbiased reasoners. We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over deep reasoning. All systems exhibit cognitive biases (ranging from 5.9% to 35% across types), with bias sensitivity increasing sharply with task complexity (up to 49%), highlighting critical risks in real-world software engineering deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination in LLM-Based Code Generation: An Automotive Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11257v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating code generation tasks offering new opportunities across software engineering domains. However, their practical application remains limited due to hallucinations - outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect, unverifiable or nonsensical. This paper investigates hallucination phenomena in the context of code generation with a specific focus on the automotive domain. A case study is presented that evaluates multiple code LLMs for three different prompting complexities ranging from a minimal one-liner prompt to a prompt with Covesa Vehicle Signal Specifications (VSS) as additional context and finally to a prompt with an additional code skeleton. The evaluation reveals a high frequency of syntax violations, invalid reference errors and API knowledge conflicts in state-of-the-art models GPT-4.1, Codex and GPT-4o. Among the evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations. These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical domains such as automotive software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORFuzz: Fuzzing the "Other Side" of LLM Safety -- Testing Over-Refusal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11222v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously rejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a critical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability. Current methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate, suffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as highlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore, ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets. ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a valuable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and trustworthy LLM-based software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTMPicker: Facilitating Efficient Pretrained Model Selection for Application Developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11179v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid emergence of pretrained models (PTMs) has attracted significant attention from both Deep Learning (DL) researchers and downstream application developers. However, selecting appropriate PTMs remains challenging because existing methods typically rely on keyword-based searches in which the keywords are often derived directly from function descriptions. This often fails to fully capture user intent and makes it difficult to identify suitable models when developers also consider factors such as bias mitigation, hardware requirements, or license compliance. To address the limitations of keyword-based model search, we propose PTMPicker to accurately identify suitable PTMs. We first define a structured template composed of common and essential attributes for PTMs and then PTMPicker represents both candidate models and user-intended features (i.e., model search requests) in this unified format. To determine whether candidate models satisfy user requirements, it computes embedding similarities for function-related attributes and uses well-crafted prompts to evaluate special constraints such as license compliance and hardware requirements. We scraped a total of 543,949 pretrained models from Hugging Face to prepare valid candidates for selection. PTMPicker then represented them in the predefined structured format by extracting their associated descriptions. Guided by the extracted metadata, we synthesized a total of 15,207 model search requests with carefully designed prompts, as no such search requests are readily available. Experiments on the curated PTM dataset and the synthesized model search requests show that PTMPicker can help users effectively identify models,with 85% of the sampled requests successfully locating appropriate PTMs within the top-10 ranked candidates.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Code Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21569v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-has reshaped Software Engineering (SE) by enabling the automation of tasks such as code generation, bug detection, and repair. However, these models require significant computational resources for training and fine-tuning, posing challenges for real-world adoption in resource-constrained environments. To address this, the research community has increasingly turned to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)-a class of techniques that enables the adaptation of large models by updating only a small subset of parameters, rather than the entire model. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we examine the growing application of PEFT techniques-across a wide range of software engineering tasks. We analyze how these methods are used to optimize various deep learning (DL) architectures, focusing on their impact on both performance and efficiency. Our study synthesizes findings from 28 peer-reviewed papers, identifying patterns in configuration strategies and adaptation trade-offs. The outcome of this review is a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes PEFT usage by task type, distinguishing between generative (e.g., Code Summarization) and non-generative (e.g., Code Clone Detection) scenarios. Our findings aim to inform future research and guide the practical deployment of PEFT in sustainable, AI-powered software development.

Yet, performance issues are notoriously difficult to detect within development environments, where their manifestations are often less conspicuous and diagnosis proves more challenging. To address this limitation, we propose RevPerf, an advanced performance issue reproduction tool that leverages app reviews from Google Play to acquire pertinent information. RevPerf employs relevant reviews and prompt engineering to enrich the original review with performance issue details. An execution agent is then employed to generate and execute commands to reproduce the issue. After executing all necessary steps, the system incorporates multifaceted detection methods to identify performance issues by monitoring Android logs, GUI changes, and system resource utilization during the reproduction process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves a 70\% success rate in reproducing performance issues on the dataset we constructed and manually validated.</p></details> | 10page, 8 figures |
| **[Fast and Accurate Silent Vulnerability Fix Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22935v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An upstream task for software bill-of-materials (SBOMs) is the accurate localization of the patch that fixes a vulnerability. Nevertheless, existing work reveals a significant gap in the CVEs whose patches exist but are not traceable. Existing works have proposed several approaches to trace/retrieve the patching commit for fixing a CVE. However, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) They cannot effectively handle long diff code of a commit; (2) We are not aware of existing work that scales to the full repository with satisfactory accuracy. Upon identifying this gap, we propose SITPatchTracer, a scalable and effective retrieval system for tracing known vulnerability patches. To handle the context length challenge, SITPatchTracer proposes a novel hierarchical embedding technique which efficiently extends the context coverage to 6x that of existing work while covering all files in the commit. To handle the scalability challenge, SITPatchTracer utilizes a three-phase framework, balancing the effectiveness/efficiency in each phase. The evaluation of SITPatchTracer demonstrates it outperforms existing patch tracing methods (PatchFinder, PatchScout, VFCFinder) by a large margin. Furthermore, SITPatchTracer outperforms VoyageAI, the SOTA commercial code embedding LLM (\$1.8 per 10K commits) on the MRR and Recall@10 by 18\% and 28\% on our two datasets. Using SITPatchTracer, we have successfully traced and merged the patch links for 35 new CVEs in the GitHub Advisory database Our ablation study reveals that hierarchical embedding is a practically effective way of handling long context for patch retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional code generation tools, agentic systems are capable of decomposing high-level goals, coordinating multi-step processes, and adapting their behavior based on intermediate feedback. These capabilities are transforming the software development practice. As this emerging field evolves rapidly, there is a need to define its scope, consolidate its technical foundations, and identify open research challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive and timely review of AI agentic programming. We introduce a taxonomy of agent behaviors and system architectures, and examine core techniques including planning, memory and context management, tool integration, and execution monitoring. We also analyze existing benchmarks and evaluation methodologies used to assess coding agent performance. Our study identifies several key challenges, including limitations in handling long context, a lack of persistent memory across tasks, and concerns around safety, alignment with user intent, and collaboration with human developers. We discuss emerging opportunities to improve the reliability, adaptability, and transparency of agentic systems. By synthesizing recent advances and outlining future directions, this survey aims to provide a foundation for research and development in building the next generation of intelligent and trustworthy AI coding agents.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we present TaFo, a neuro-symbolic approach to generating CF suggestions for tables, addressing common challenges such as user unawareness, difficulty in rule creation, and inadequate user interfaces. TaFo takes inspiration from component based synthesis systems and extends them with semantic knowledge of language models and a diversity preserving rule ranking.Unlike previous methods focused on structural formatting, TaFo uniquely incorporates value-based formatting, automatically learning both the rule trigger and the associated visual formatting properties for CF rules. By removing the dependency on user specification used by existing techniques in the form of formatted examples or natural language instruction, TaFo makes formatting completely predictive and automated for the user. To evaluate TaFo, we use a corpus of 1.8 Million public workbooks with CF and manual formatting. We compare TaFo against a diverse set of symbolic and neural systems designed for or adapted for the task of table formatting. Our results show that TaFo generates more accurate, diverse and complete formatting suggestions than current systems and outperforms these by 15.6\%--26.5\% on matching user added ground truth rules in tables.</p></details> | 14 pages |

During later steps of the diffusion process, when the code snippet has almost converged, differences between discrete representations of these snippets look like last-mile repairs applied to broken or incomplete code. We evaluate the extent to which this resemblance can be exploited to leverage pre-trained code diffusion models for the problem of last-mile repair by considering two applications with significant potential. First, we can leverage the diffusion model for last-mile repair by adding noise to a broken code snippet and resuming the diffusion process. Second, we can leverage the diffusion model to generate arbitrary amount of training data for last-mile repair tasks (that are computationally more efficient) by sampling an intermediate program (input) and the final program (output) from the diffusion process. We perform experiments on 3 domains (Python, Excel and PowerShell) to evaluate applications, as well as analyze properties.</p></details> | 12 pages |

We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAFix: History-Augmented Large Language Models for Bug Fixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09135v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have explored the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various Software Engineering (SE) tasks, such as code generation and bug fixing. However, these approaches typically rely on the context data from the current snapshot of the project, overlooking the potential of rich historical data residing in real-world software repositories. Additionally, the impact of prompt styles on LLM performance for SE tasks within a historical context remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose HAFix, which stands for History-Augmented LLMs on Bug Fixing, a novel approach that leverages seven individual historical heuristics associated with bugs and aggregates the results of these heuristics (HAFix-Agg) to enhance LLMs' bug-fixing capabilities. To empirically evaluate HAFix, we employ three Code LLMs (i.e., Code Llama, DeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite models) on 51 single-line Python bugs from BugsInPy and 116 single-line Java bugs from Defects4J. Our evaluation demonstrates that multiple HAFix heuristics achieve statistically significant improvements compared to a non-historical baseline inspired by GitHub Copilot. Furthermore, the aggregated HAFix variant HAFix-Agg achieves substantial improvements by combining the complementary strengths of individual heuristics, increasing bug-fixing rates by an average of 45.05% on BugsInPy and 49.92% on Defects4J relative to the corresponding baseline. Moreover, within the context of historical heuristics, we identify the Instruction prompt style as the most effective template compared to the InstructionLabel and InstructionMask for LLMs in bug fixing. Finally, we evaluate the cost of HAFix in terms of inference time and token usage, and provide a pragmatic trade-off analysis of the cost and bug-fixing performance, offering valuable insights for the practical deployment of our approach in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expan...</summary><p>Expanded HAFix evaluation to include two datasets (BugsInPy, Defects4J) and three LLMs (CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder-V2)</p></details> |

However, developing and understanding scientific workflows remains challenging for many domain scientists due to the complexity of tool/module selection, infrastructure requirements, and limited programming expertise. This study explores whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and DeepSeek-V3 can assist in generating accurate, complete, and usable bioinformatics workflows. We evaluate a set of representative workflows covering tasks such as RNA-seq, SNP analysis, and DNA methylation across both Galaxy (graphical) and Nextflow (script-based) platforms. To simulate realistic usage, we adopt a tiered prompting strategy: each workflow is first generated using an instruction-only prompt; if the output is incomplete or incorrect, we escalate to a role-based prompt, and finally to chain-of-thought prompting if needed. The generated workflows are evaluated against community-curated baselines from the Galaxy Training Network and nf-core, using criteria including correctness, completeness, tool appropriateness, and executability. Results show that LLMs exhibit strong potential in workflow development. Gemini 2.5 Flash produced the most accurate and user-friendly workflows in Galaxy, while DeepSeek-V3 excelled in Nextflow pipeline generation. GPT-4o performed nicely with structured prompts. Prompting strategy significantly influenced output quality, with role-based and chain-of-thought prompts enhancing correctness and completeness. Overall, LLMs can reduce the cognitive and technical barriers to workflow development, making SWSs more accessible to novice and expert users. This work highlights the practical utility of LLMs and provides actionable insights for integrating them into real-world bioinformatics workflow design.</p></details> | 46pages |

| **[The Impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Code Review Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11034v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained prominence in the field of software development, significantly boosting productivity and simplifying teamwork. Although prior studies have examined task-specific applications, the phase-specific effects of LLM assistance on the efficiency of code review processes remain underexplored. This research investigates the effect of GPT on GitHub pull request (PR) workflows, with a focus on reducing resolution time, optimizing phase-specific performance, and assisting developers. We curated a dataset of 25,473 PRs from 9,254 GitHub projects and identified GPT-assisted PRs using a semi-automated heuristic approach that combines keyword-based detection, regular expression filtering, and manual verification until achieving 95% labeling accuracy. We then applied statistical modeling, including multiple linear regression and Mann-Whitney U test, to evaluate differences between GPT-assisted and non-assisted PRs, both at the overall resolution level and across distinct review phases. Our research has revealed that early adoption of GPT can substantially boost the effectiveness of the PR process, leading to considerable time savings at various stages. Our findings suggest that GPT-assisted PRs reduced median resolution time by more than 60% (9 hours compared to 23 hours for non-assisted PRs). We discovered that utilizing GPT can reduce the review time by 33% and the waiting time before acceptance by 87%. Analyzing a sample dataset of 300 GPT-assisted PRs, we discovered that developers predominantly use GPT for code optimization (60%), bug fixing (26%), and documentation updates (12%). This research sheds light on the impact of the GPT model on the code review process, offering actionable insights for software teams seeking to enhance workflows and promote seamless collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeJudgeBench: Benchmarking LLM-as-a-Judge for Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10535v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking. However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved judge performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mattymchen/codejudgebench</p></details> |

This work explores the unique characteristics of CNAs and their impact on governance. We introduce a comprehensive reference architecture designed to streamline governance across CNAs, along with a sample implementation, offering insights for both single and multi-cloud environments. Our architecture seamlessly integrates governance within the CNA framework, adhering to a ``battery-included'' philosophy. Tailored for both expansive and compact CNA deployments across various industries, this design enables cloud practitioners to prioritize product development by alleviating the complexities associated with governance. In addition, it provides a building block for academic exploration of generic CNA frameworks, highlighting their relevance in the evolving cloud computing landscape.</p></details> |  |

Empirical software engineering researchers studying software evolution gather and collect datasets with millions of events, representing changes introduced to specific artifacts. In this paper, we propose EvoScat, a tool that attempts addressing temporal scalability through the usage of interactive density scatterplot to provide a global overview of large historical datasets mined from open source repositories in a single visualization. EvoScat intents to provide researchers with a mean to produce scalable visualizations that can help them explore and characterize evolution datasets, as well as comparing the histories of individual artifacts, both in terms of 1) observing how rapidly different artifacts age over multiple-year-long time spans 2) how often metrics associated with each artifacts tend towards an improvement or worsening. The paper shows how the tool can be tailored to specific analysis needs (pace of change comparison, clone detection, freshness assessment) thanks to its support for flexible configuration of history scaling and alignment along the time axis, artifacts sorting and interactive color mapping, enabling the analysis of millions of events obtained by mining the histories of tens of thousands of software artifacts. We include in this paper a gallery showcasing datasets gathering specific artifacts (OpenAPI descriptions, GitHub workflow definitions) across multiple repositories, as well as diving into the history of specific popular open source projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to VISSOFT 2025.

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising assistance by explaining formula errors, the automated correction of these semantic runtime errors remains an open problem. A primary challenge to advancing models for such scenarios is the severe lack of high-quality, comprehensive datasets for training and rigorous evaluation. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach for constructing a benchmark dataset specifically designed for Excel formula repair. We propose a data generation pipeline, which leverages a small set of curated seed samples from online forums to synthetically expand the dataset. Our pipeline integrates few-shot prompting with LLMs and employs a robust \textit{LLM-as-a-Judge} validation framework, combined with execution-based checks to ensure the correctness and semantic fidelity of the generated data. This process produced a benchmark dataset of 618 high-quality samples, covering common runtime errors. Furthermore, we propose a context-aware baseline technique for Excel formula repair that utilizes LLMs to leverage both the faulty formula, and relevant spreadsheet context. We evaluate the performance of various LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Phi-3, Mistral) on our newly generated benchmark using execution-based metrics. Our analysis demonstrates the dataset's quality through manual annotation and provides insights into error and function distributions. The proposed generation methodology is highly scalable and can be readily adapted to create evaluation benchmarks for similar code repair tasks in other low-resource programming languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the KDD workshop on Evaluation and Trustworthiness of Agentic and Generative AI Models</p></details> |

Ensuring their architectural trustworthiness is essential for maintaining system stability and quality attributes over time. Since SAS architectures are inherently complex, reference models such as MAPE-K have been proposed to guide their design, emphasizing the Feedback Loop as a central component. MAPE-K prescribes abstractions and communication rules that, when preserved, enhance system maintainability, comprehensibility, and conformance. However, maintenance activities often introduce deviations, leading to architectural erosion and loss of compliance with the reference model. Architectural Conformance Checking (ACC) addresses this issue by verifying whether a system's implementation aligns with its Planned Architecture (PA) or a reference model like MAPE-K. In this paper, we introduce REMEDY, a tailored ACC approach for SASs that consists of three key components: (i) A domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying planned architectures based on MAPE-K abstractions; (ii) A tool for recovering the system's current architecture (CA); (iii) A conformance checking process that detects and visualizes architectural deviations. We evaluate REMEDY by comparing its SAS-specific DSL with a general-purpose DSL, demonstrating higher productivity and precision in architectural specification. Additionally, REMEDY effectively identifies and facilitates the correction of non-conformance issues, thereby improving the maintainability and architectural trustworthiness of adaptive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The o...</summary><p>The original paper was submitted to the JSERD journal; however, as the journal was not indexed in the Web of Science and the review process was delayed, we decided to withdraw it and submit it to the Automated Software Engineering Journal.

| **[Bridging Solidity Evolution Gaps: An LLM-Enhanced Approach for Smart Contract Compilation Error Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10517v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92% of compilation errors. To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek) and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts. Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration. Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME) 2025</p></details> |

Particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing, maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result, many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa Motoman GP4.</p></details> | <details><summary>34th ...</summary><p>34th International Conference on Robotics in Alpe-Adria-Danube Region (RAAD 2025)</p></details> |

However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities. Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and extract the code features involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules. They then use code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions. These methods are hindered by imprecision due to (1) the exclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of code clone detection. This paper presents VERCATION, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++. VERCATION combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. It then backtracks historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code. We propose code clone detection based on expanded and normalized ASTs to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling the identification of the vulnerable versions between the vulnerability-fixing commit and the vic. We curate a dataset linking 122 OSS vulnerabilities and 1,211 versions to evaluate VERCATION. On this dataset, our approach achieves an F1 score of 93.1%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, VERCATION detected 202 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out of Distribution, Out of Luck: How Well Can LLMs Trained on Vulnerability Datasets Detect Top 25 CWE Weaknesses?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21817v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated vulnerability detection research has made substantial progress, yet its real-world impact remains limited. Current vulnerability datasets suffer from issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20-71%, extensive duplication, and poor coverage of critical CWE types. These issues create a significant "generalization gap" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance (measured on held-out data from the same dataset for training) by exploiting spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our analysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of up to 33% when evaluated on independent data, with some performing close to random guessing. To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we introduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25 Most Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset, TitanVul, comprising 38,863 functions by aggregating seven public sources and applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework. Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but critical CWE types through simulated development workflows. Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the generalization gap. First, BenchVul shows the limitations of self-testing: models trained on existing datasets, such as BigVul and CVEfixes, experience performance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to 0.519 and from 0.713 to 0.607). Second, training models on TitanVul demonstrates improved generalization, with model performance increasing from 0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to 0.767 when tested on BenchVul. Third, supplementing TitanVul with RVG-generated data yields further gains, increasing model performance by 14.0% to 0.874.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the synchronization between Hugging Face pre-trained language models and their upstream GitHub repository](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10157v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained language models (PTLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP), enabling progress in tasks like text generation and translation. Like software package management, PTLMs are trained using code and environment scripts in upstream repositories (e.g., GitHub, GH) and distributed as variants via downstream platforms like Hugging Face (HF). Coordinating development between GH and HF poses challenges such as misaligned release timelines, inconsistent versioning, and limited reuse of PTLM variants. We conducted a mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit activities are coordinated. Our analysis reveals that GH contributors typically make changes related to specifying the version of the model, improving code quality, performance optimization, and dependency management within the training scripts, while HF contributors make changes related to improving model descriptions, data set handling, and setup required for model inference. Furthermore, to understand the synchronization aspects of commit activities between GH and HF, we examined three dimensions of these activities -- lag (delay), type of synchronization, and intensity -- which together yielded eight distinct synchronization patterns. The prevalence of partially synchronized patterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals structural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices. These patterns often result in isolated changes -- where improvements or fixes made on one platform are never replicated on the other -- and in some cases, indicate an abandonment of one repository in favor of the other. Such fragmentation risks exposing end users to incomplete, outdated, or behaviorally inconsistent models.

Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts, so complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed. SMAT relies on generating and executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a developer's modified version, but fails again after merging with another developer's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated. While SMAT is effective at detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly due to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and Evosuite. To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome these limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on Code Llama 70B into SMAT. We explore the model's ability to generate tests using different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter configurations. Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler systems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex, real-world systems. We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in detecting conflicts. Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation remains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there is promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 11 pages, in Portuguese language. 3 figures.

| **[Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars. We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly, our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains practical.</p></details> |  |

Our results indicate that students found all implemented feedback types helpful, with automatic testing ranked as the most useful. We also introduce a dataset comprising 7201 correct and incorrect Prolog submissions, along with 200 manually annotated programs labeled with bug types and corresponding corrections.

| **[Leveraging Reviewer Experience in Code Review Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10959v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code. Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved. To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews. Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation. Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture. However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training. This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback. To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality. Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function. Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour. Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated. The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

On one hand, low-latency code completion offers completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.</p></details> |  |

While FFI boosts efficiency and extensibility, it also introduces risks. Existing studies focus on FFIs in languages like Python and Java, neglecting CGO, the emerging FFI in Go, which poses unique risks. To address these concerns, we conduct an empirical study of CGO usage across 920 open-source Go projects. Our study aims to reveal the distribution, patterns, purposes, and critical issues associated with CGO, offering insights for developers and the Go team. We develop CGOAnalyzer, a tool to efficiently identify and quantify CGO-related features. Our findings reveal that: (1) 11.3% of analyzed Go projects utilize CGO, with usage concentrated in a subset of projects; (2) CGO serves 4 primary purposes, including system-level interactions and performance optimizations, with 15 distinct usage patterns observed; (3) 19 types of CGO-related issues exist, including one critical issue involving unnecessary pointer checks that pose risks of runtime crashes due to limitations in the current Go compilation toolchain; (4) a temporary solution reduces unnecessary pointer checks, mitigating crash risks, and (5) we submitted a proposal to improve the Go toolchain for a permanent fix, which has been grouped within an accepted proposal for future resolution. Our findings provide valuable insights for developers and the Go team, enhancing development efficiency and reliability while improving the robustness of the Go toolchain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in The Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

Quantitative analysis of the microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume. Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures and 6 pages main article, 17 pages total, 8 figures total, to be published in SoftwareX</p></details> |

As code review nowadays is lightweight, various issues can be identified, and sometimes, they can be trivial. Research has investigated automated approaches to classify review comments to gauge the effectiveness of code reviews. However, previous studies have primarily relied on supervised machine learning, which requires extensive manual annotation to train the models effectively. To address this limitation, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify code review comments. We assess the performance of LLMs to classify 17 categories of code review comments. Our results show that LLMs can classify code review comments, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach using a trained deep learning model. In particular, LLMs achieve better accuracy in classifying the five most useful categories, which the state-of-the-art approach struggles with due to low training examples. Rather than relying solely on a specific small training data distribution, our results show that LLMs provide balanced performance across high- and low-frequency categories. These results suggest that the LLMs could offer a scalable solution for code review analytics to improve the effectiveness of the code review process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis & Manipulation (SCAM)</p></details> |
| **[Fast and Accurate Heuristics for Bus-Factor Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09828v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bus-factor is a critical risk indicator that quantifies how many key contributors a project can afford to lose before core knowledge or functionality is compromised. Despite its practical importance, accurately computing the bus-factor is NP-Hard under established formalizations, making scalable analysis infeasible for large software systems. In this paper, we model software projects as bipartite graphs of developers and tasks and propose two novel approximation heuristics, Minimum Coverage and Maximum Coverage, based on iterative graph peeling, for two influential bus-factor formalizations. Our methods significantly outperform the widely adopted degree-based heuristic, which we show can yield severely inflated estimates. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation on over $1\,000$ synthetic power-law graphs and demonstrate that our heuristics provide tighter estimates while scaling to graphs with millions of nodes and edges in minutes. Our results reveal that the proposed heuristics are not only more accurate but also robust to structural variations in developer-task assignment graph. We release our implementation as open-source software to support future research and practical adoption.</p></details> |  |

Although OWASP's existing taxonomy covers many attack vectors, our analysis identifies gaps in modeling failures, including, but not limited to: reasoning collapse across planner-executor chains, metric overfitting, unsafe delegation escalation, emergent covert coordination, and heterogeneous multi-agent exploits. We introduce additional threat classes and scenarios grounded in practical MAS deployments, highlighting risks from benign goal drift, cross-agent hallucination propagation, affective prompt framing, and multi-agent backdoors. We also outline evaluation strategies, including robustness testing, coordination assessment, safety enforcement, and emergent behavior monitoring, to ensure complete coverage. This work complements the framework of OWASP by expanding its applicability to increasingly complex, autonomous, and adaptive multi-agent systems, with the goal of improving security posture and resilience in real world deployments.</p></details> |  |

In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first parallel hybrid quantum-classical architecture deployed on a real-world power-plant dataset, illustrating how near-term quantum resources can already augment classical analytics in the energy sector.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

The framework further employs in-context learning to extract migration intents from commit messages to enhance the accuracy of its recommendations. To evaluate the effectiveness of LibRec, we introduce LibEval, a benchmark designed to assess the performance in the library migration recommendation task. LibEval comprises 2,888 migration records associated with 2,368 libraries extracted from 2,324 Python repositories. Each migration record captures source-target library pairs, along with their corresponding migration intents and intent types. Based on LibEval, we evaluated the effectiveness of ten popular LLMs within our framework, conducted an ablation study to examine the contributions of key components within our framework, explored the impact of various prompt strategies on the framework's performance, assessed its effectiveness across various intent types, and performed detailed failure case analyses.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis. Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level code completion systems.</p></details> |  |

Their strengths in information processing, attention to detail, innovative thinking, and commitment to high-quality outcomes in the ICT domain are well-documented. However, despite their potential, autistic individuals often face barriers in Software Engineering (SE) roles due to a lack of personalised tools, complex work environments, non-inclusive recruitment practices, limited co-worker support, challenging social dynamics and so on. Motivated by the ethical framework of the neurodiversity movement and the success of pioneering initiatives like the Dandelion program, corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in the ICT sector has increasingly focused on autistic talent. This movement fundamentally reframes challenges not as individual deficits but as failures of environments designed for a neurotypical majority. Despite this progress, there is no synthesis of knowledge reporting the full pathway from software engineering education through to sustainable workplace inclusion. To address this, we conducted a Systematic Review of 30 studies and identified 18 success factors grouped into four thematic categories: (1) Software Engineering Education, (2) Career and Employment Training, (3) Work Environment, and (4) Tools and Assistive Technologies. Our findings offer evidence-based recommendations for educational institutions, employers, organisations, and tool developers to enhance the inclusion of autistic individuals in SE. These include strategies for inclusive meeting and collaboration practices, accessible and structured work environments, clear role and responsibility definitions, and the provision of tailored workplace accommodations.</p></details> |  |

The process of code review is highly inefficient for several reasons, such as it being a time-consuming process, inconsistent feedback, and review quality not being at par most of the time. Using our telemetry data, we observed that at TATA 1mg, pull request (PR) processing exhibits significant inefficiencies, with average pick-up and review times of 73 and 82 hours, respectively, resulting in a 6.2 day closure cycle. The review cycle was marked by prolonged iterative communication between the reviewing and submitting parties. Research from the University of California, Irvine indicates that interruptions can lead to an average of 23 minutes of lost focus, critically affecting code quality and timely delivery. To address these challenges, we developed DeputyDev's PR review capabilities by providing automated, contextual code reviews. We conducted a rigorous double-controlled A/B experiment involving over 200 engineers to evaluate DeputyDev's impact on review times. The results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in both average per PR (23.09%) and average per-line-of-code (40.13%) review durations. After implementing safeguards to exclude outliers, DeputyDev has been effectively rolled out across the entire organisation. Additionally, it has been made available to external companies as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, currently supporting the daily work of numerous engineering professionals. This study explores the implementation and effectiveness of AI-assisted code reviews in improving development workflow timelines and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 6 pages of supplementary materials</p></details> |

Existing automated methods rely heavily on manual analysis, while recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches suffer from hallucinations and limited controllability. In this paper, we propose ReqInOne, an LLM-based agent that follows the common steps taken by human requirements engineers when writing an SRS to convert natural language into a structured SRS. ReqInOne adopts a modular architecture by decomposing SRS generation into three tasks: summary, requirement extraction, and requirement classification, each supported by tailored prompt templates to improve the quality and consistency of LLM outputs. We evaluate ReqInOne using GPT-4o, LLaMA 3, and DeepSeek-R1, and compare the generated SRSs against those produced by the holistic GPT-4-based method from prior work as well as by entry-level requirements engineers. Expert evaluations show that ReqInOne produces more accurate and well-structured SRS documents. The performance advantage of ReqInOne benefits from its modular design, and experimental results further demonstrate that its requirement classification component achieves comparable or even better results than the state-of-the-art requirement classification model.</p></details> |  |

However, current evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically analyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within these systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative programmable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this benchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with two LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%. Through in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure causes aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution issues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose actionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis capabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides an empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous agent systems in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE 2025 NIER</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 28.07%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, META is primarily limited to the objective assessment of test scripts, lacking the ability to automatically assess subjective aspects such as test case and test report. To address this limitation, this paper proposes RUM, a comprehensive assessment approach that combines rules and large language models (LLMs). RUM achieves a comprehensive assessment by rapidly processing objective indicators through rules while utilizing LLMs for in-depth subjective analysis of test case documents, test scripts, and test reports. The experimental results show that compared to traditional manual testing skill assessment, RUM improves assessment efficiency by 80.77\% and reduces costs by 97.38\%, while maintaining high accuracy and consistency of assessment. By applying RUM on the contest on software testing, we find that it not only enhances the efficiency and scalability of skill assessment in software testing education, but also provides teachers with more comprehensive and objective evidence for student ability assessment, facilitating personalized teaching and learning. This study offers new insights into the assessment of testing skills, which are expected to promote further development in test process optimization and software quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards -- SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified -- have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (79 entries) and Verified (99 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 80 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |

Bugs in widely used deep learning APIs can propagate to downstream systems, causing serious consequences. While existing fuzzing techniques detect bugs through intra-framework testing across hardware backends (CPU vs. GPU), they may miss bugs that manifest identically across backends and thus escape detection under these strategies. To address this problem, we propose XAMT, a cross-framework fuzzing method that tests deep learning libraries by matching and comparing functionally equivalent APIs across different frameworks. XAMT matches APIs using similarity-based rules based on names, descriptions, and parameter structures. It then aligns inputs and applies variance-guided differential testing to detect bugs. We evaluated XAMT on five popular frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and JAX. XAMT matched 839 APIs and identified 238 matched API groups, and detected 17 bugs, 12 of which have been confirmed. Our results show that XAMT uncovers bugs undetectable by intra-framework testing, especially those that manifest consistently across backends. XAMT offers a complementary approach to existing methods and offers a new perspective on the testing of deep learning libraries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Systematic Failures of LLMs in Verifying Code Against Natural Language Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12358v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software development, widely used for requirements engineering, code generation and review tasks. Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system code implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code robustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably determine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions, which is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time, our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with requirements. We also offer novel insights and practical guidance for effective use of LLMs in automated code review and task-oriented agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |

In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Where Are Large Language Models for Code Generation on GitHub?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19544v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has garnered significant attention from researchers assessing the quality of the code they generate. However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which fail to adequately represent how developers actually utilize LLMs' code generation capabilities or clarify the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To bridge this gap, our study investigates the characteristics of LLM-generated code and its corresponding projects hosted on GitHub. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot are the most frequently utilized for generating code on GitHub. In contrast, there is very little code generated by other LLMs on GitHub. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code are often small and less known, led by individuals or small teams. Despite this, most projects are continuously evolving and improving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot is mainly utilized for generating Python, Java, and TypeScript scripts for data processing and transformation. C/C++ and JavaScript code generation focuses on algorithm and data structure implementation and user interface code. Most ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code snippets are relatively short and exhibit low complexity. (4) Compared to human-written code, ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code exists in a small proportion of projects and generally undergoes fewer modifications. Additionally, modifications due to bugs are even fewer, ranging from just 3% to 8% across different languages. (5) Most comments on ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code lack detailed information, often only stating the code's origin without mentioning prompts, human modifications, or testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines the concepts, principles, implementation, and prospects of Ethereum based gambling DApps. First, we outline the concept and operational principles of gambling DApps. These DApps are blockchain based online lottery platforms. They utilize smart contracts to manage the entire lottery process, including issuance, betting, drawing, and prize distribution. Being decentralized, lottery DApps operate without central oversight, unlike traditional lotteries. This ensures fairness and eliminates control by any single entity. Automated smart contract execution further reduces management costs, increases profitability, and enhances game transparency and credibility. Next, we analyze an existing Ethereum based gambling DApp, detailing its technical principles, implementation, operational status, vulnerabilities, and potential solutions. We then elaborate on the implementation of lottery DApps. Smart contracts automate the entire lottery process including betting, drawing, and prize distribution. Although developing lottery DApps requires technical expertise, the expanding Ethereum ecosystem provides growing tools and frameworks, lowering development barriers. Finally, we discuss current limitations and prospects of lottery DApps. As blockchain technology and smart contracts evolve, lottery DApps are positioned to significantly transform the online lottery industry. Advantages like decentralization, automation, and transparency will likely drive broader future adoption.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a challenging task. A study on GitHub shows that only 42.2% of the issues are correctly linked to their commits. This highlights the potential for further development and research in this area. Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based approaches, and with the recent development of large language models, researchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer from two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows and cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit histories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most methods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single issue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This quickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of thousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the first autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery. The lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access the rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files, without exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most relevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically pinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible candidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art issue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all our case study projects. We also publicly release LinkAnchor as a ready-to-use tool, along with our replication package. LinkAnchor is designed and tested for GitHub and Jira, and is easily extendable to other platforms.</p></details> |  |

The Meta Quest VR platform, driven by Meta, has democratized VR app publishing and attracted millions of users worldwide. However, as the number of published apps grows, there is a notable lack of robust headless tools for user interface (UI) exploration and user event testing. To address this need, we present AUTOVR, an automatic framework for dynamic UI and user event interaction in VR apps built on the Unity Engine. Unlike conventional Android and GUI testers, AUTOVR analyzes the app's internal binary to reveal hidden events, resolves generative event dependencies, and utilizes them for comprehensive exploration of VR apps. Using sensitive data exposure as a performance metric, we compare AUTOVR with Android Monkey, a widely used headless Android GUI stress testing tool. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates AUTOVR's superior performance, triggering an order of magnitude of more sensitive data exposures and significantly enhancing the privacy of VR apps.</p></details> | <details><summary>USENI...</summary><p>USENIX Security 2025, 19 Pages, 14 Figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

However, current evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically analyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within these systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative programmable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this benchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with two LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%. Through in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure causes aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution issues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose actionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis capabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides an empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous agent systems in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE 2025 NIER</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 28.07%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[RUM: Rule+LLM-Based Comprehensive Assessment on Testing Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12922v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past eight years, the META method has served as a multidimensional testing skill assessment system in the National College Student Contest on Software Testing, successfully assessing over 100,000 students' testing skills. However, META is primarily limited to the objective assessment of test scripts, lacking the ability to automatically assess subjective aspects such as test case and test report. To address this limitation, this paper proposes RUM, a comprehensive assessment approach that combines rules and large language models (LLMs). RUM achieves a comprehensive assessment by rapidly processing objective indicators through rules while utilizing LLMs for in-depth subjective analysis of test case documents, test scripts, and test reports. The experimental results show that compared to traditional manual testing skill assessment, RUM improves assessment efficiency by 80.77\% and reduces costs by 97.38\%, while maintaining high accuracy and consistency of assessment. By applying RUM on the contest on software testing, we find that it not only enhances the efficiency and scalability of skill assessment in software testing education, but also provides teachers with more comprehensive and objective evidence for student ability assessment, facilitating personalized teaching and learning. This study offers new insights into the assessment of testing skills, which are expected to promote further development in test process optimization and software quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards -- SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified -- have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (79 entries) and Verified (99 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 80 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |

However, studies reveal that their grasp of fundamental programming concepts, such as data flow and control flow, remains shallow, leading to fragile performance when code requires deeper reasoning. This limitation restricts the practical adoption of LLMs in real-world software development. To address this issue, this work introduces a counterfactual code augmentation framework combined with concept-aware tuning, designed to guide LLMs toward stronger conceptual understanding. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL environment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models (LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom reward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization, configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios. Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic tuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across various real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in diverse environments. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/LHY-24/OS-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Analysis of MCP Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12538v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a universal standard that enables AI agents to seamlessly connect with external tools, significantly enhancing their functionality. However, while MCP brings notable benefits, it also introduces significant vulnerabilities, such as Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where hidden malicious instructions exploit the sycophancy of large language models (LLMs) to manipulate agent behavior. Despite these risks, current academic research on MCP security remains limited, with most studies focusing on narrow or qualitative analyses that fail to capture the diversity of real-world threats. To address this gap, we present the MCP Attack Library (MCPLIB), which categorizes and implements 31 distinct attack methods under four key classifications: direct tool injection, indirect tool injection, malicious user attacks, and LLM inherent attack. We further conduct a quantitative analysis of the efficacy of each attack. Our experiments reveal key insights into MCP vulnerabilities, including agents' blind reliance on tool descriptions, sensitivity to file-based attacks, chain attacks exploiting shared context, and difficulty distinguishing external data from executable commands. These insights, validated through attack experiments, underscore the urgency for robust defense strategies and informed MCP design. Our contributions include 1) constructing a comprehensive MCP attack taxonomy, 2) introducing a unified attack framework MCPLIB, and 3) conducting empirical vulnerability analysis to enhance MCP security mechanisms. This work provides a foundational framework, supporting the secure evolution of MCP ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Systematic Failures of LLMs in Verifying Code Against Natural Language Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12358v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software development, widely used for requirements engineering, code generation and review tasks. Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system code implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code robustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably determine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions, which is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time, our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with requirements. We also offer novel insights and practical guidance for effective use of LLMs in automated code review and task-oriented agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |

Realizing such models requires substantial system-level support. Deep learning (DL) frameworks provide this foundation by enabling efficient model construction, distributed execution, and optimized deployment. The large parameter scale and extended execution cycles impose exacting demands on deep learning frameworks, particularly in terms of scalability, stability, and efficiency. Therefore, poor usability, limited functionality, and subtle bugs in DL frameworks may hinder development efficiency and cause severe failures or resource waste. However, a fundamental question has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies, i.e., what challenges do DL frameworks face in supporting LLMs? To answer this question, we analyze issue reports from three major DL frameworks (i.e., MindSpore, PyTorch, and TensorFlow) and eight associated LLM toolkits such as Megatron. Based on a manual review of these reports, we construct a taxonomy that captures LLM-centric framework bugs, user requirements, and user questions. We then refine and enrich this taxonomy through interviews with 11 LLM users and eight DL framework developers. Based on the constructed taxonomy and findings summarized from interviews, our study further reveals key technical challenges and mismatches between LLM user needs and developer priorities.</p></details> | 46 pages, 14 figures |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 28.07%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |

The common way to review changes relies on examining code diffs, where textual differences between two file versions are highlighted in red and green to indicate additions and deletions of lines. This can be cumbersome for developers, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive overview of all changes in a commit. Moreover, certain types of code changes can be particularly significant and may warrant differentiation from standard modifications to enhance code comprehension. We present a novel visualization approach supported by a tool named ChangePrism, which provides a way to better understand code changes. The tool comprises two components: extraction, which retrieves code changes and relevant information from the git history, and visualization, which offers both general and detailed views of code changes in commits. The general view provides an overview of different types of code changes across commits, while the detailed view displays the exact changes in the source code for each commit.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, VISSOFT 2025</p></details> |

However, studies reveal that their grasp of fundamental programming concepts, such as data flow and control flow, remains shallow, leading to fragile performance when code requires deeper reasoning. This limitation restricts the practical adoption of LLMs in real-world software development. To address this issue, this work introduces a counterfactual code augmentation framework combined with concept-aware tuning, designed to guide LLMs toward stronger conceptual understanding. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL environment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models (LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom reward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization, configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios. Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic tuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across various real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in diverse environments. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/LHY-24/OS-R1.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in the use of AI tools have broadened available options, system-driven approaches that offer explicit guidance and step-by-step information management may be especially effective in supporting novices during the design process. This study qualitatively examines the experiences of 60 novice engineers using such a system-driven cloud design support tool. The findings indicate that structured and proactive system guidance helps novices engage more effectively in architectural design, especially when addressing tasks where knowledge and experience gaps are most critical. For example, participants found it easier to create initial architectures and did not need to craft prompts themselves. In addition, participants reported that the ability to simulate and compare multiple architecture options enabled them to deepen their understanding of cloud design principles and trade-offs, demonstrating the educational value of system-driven support. The study also identifies areas for improvement, including more adaptive information delivery tailored to user expertise, mechanisms for validating system outputs, and better integration with implementation workflows such as infrastructure-as-code generation and deployment guidance. Addressing these aspects can further enhance the educational and practical value of system-driven support tools for cloud architecture design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Systematic Failures of LLMs in Verifying Code Against Natural Language Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12358v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software development, widely used for requirements engineering, code generation and review tasks. Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system code implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code robustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably determine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions, which is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time, our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with requirements. We also offer novel insights and practical guidance for effective use of LLMs in automated code review and task-oriented agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which fail to adequately represent how developers actually utilize LLMs' code generation capabilities or clarify the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To bridge this gap, our study investigates the characteristics of LLM-generated code and its corresponding projects hosted on GitHub. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot are the most frequently utilized for generating code on GitHub. In contrast, there is very little code generated by other LLMs on GitHub. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code are often small and less known, led by individuals or small teams. Despite this, most projects are continuously evolving and improving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot is mainly utilized for generating Python, Java, and TypeScript scripts for data processing and transformation. C/C++ and JavaScript code generation focuses on algorithm and data structure implementation and user interface code. Most ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code snippets are relatively short and exhibit low complexity. (4) Compared to human-written code, ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code exists in a small proportion of projects and generally undergoes fewer modifications. Additionally, modifications due to bugs are even fewer, ranging from just 3% to 8% across different languages. (5) Most comments on ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code lack detailed information, often only stating the code's origin without mentioning prompts, human modifications, or testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Demystifying Users' Perception on AI Coding Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12285v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to explore fundamental questions in the era when AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are widely adopted: what do developers truly value and criticize in AI coding assistants, and what does this reveal about their needs and expectations in real-world software development? Unlike previous studies that conduct observational research in controlled and simulated environments, we analyze extensive, first-hand user reviews of AI coding assistants, which capture developers' authentic perspectives and experiences drawn directly from their actual day-to-day work contexts. We identify 1,085 AI coding assistants from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Although they only account for 1.64% of all extensions, we observe a surge in these assistants: over 90% of them are released within the past two years. We then manually analyze the user reviews sampled from 32 AI coding assistants that have sufficient installations and reviews to construct a comprehensive taxonomy of user concerns and feedback about these assistants. We manually annotate each review's attitude when mentioning certain aspects of coding assistants, yielding nuanced insights into user satisfaction and dissatisfaction regarding specific features, concerns, and overall tool performance. Built on top of the findings-including how users demand not just intelligent suggestions but also context-aware, customizable, and resource-efficient interactions-we propose five practical implications and suggestions to guide the enhancement of AI coding assistants that satisfy user needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Camera-Ready Version that will appear in ASE 2025</p></details> |

However, META is primarily limited to the objective assessment of test scripts, lacking the ability to automatically assess subjective aspects such as test case and test report. To address this limitation, this paper proposes RUM, a comprehensive assessment approach that combines rules and large language models (LLMs). RUM achieves a comprehensive assessment by rapidly processing objective indicators through rules while utilizing LLMs for in-depth subjective analysis of test case documents, test scripts, and test reports. The experimental results show that compared to traditional manual testing skill assessment, RUM improves assessment efficiency by 80.77\% and reduces costs by 97.38\%, while maintaining high accuracy and consistency of assessment. By applying RUM on the contest on software testing, we find that it not only enhances the efficiency and scalability of skill assessment in software testing education, but also provides teachers with more comprehensive and objective evidence for student ability assessment, facilitating personalized teaching and learning. This study offers new insights into the assessment of testing skills, which are expected to promote further development in test process optimization and software quality assurance.</p></details> |  |
