| **[In-Context Learning as an Effective Estimator of Functional Correctness of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05200v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying LLM-based code generation to software development projects that follow a feature-driven or rapid application development approach, it becomes necessary to estimate the functional correctness of the generated code in the absence of test cases. Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating "relevance" for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative software development, where quality is defined in terms of "functional correctness". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based approach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach for code quality estimation.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the detection of DL framework defects is important and challenging. As one of the most widely adopted DL testing techniques, model mutation has recently gained significant attention. In this study, we revisit the defect detection ability of existing mutation-based testing methods and investigate the factors that influence their effectiveness. To begin with, we reviewed existing methods and observed that many of them mutate DL models (e.g., changing their parameters) without any customization, ignoring the unique challenges in framework testing. Another issue with these methods is their limited effectiveness, characterized by a high rate of false positives caused by illegal mutations arising from the use of generic, non-customized mutation operators. Moreover, we tracked the defects identified by these methods and discovered that most of them were ignored by developers. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the effectiveness of existing mutation-based testing methods in detecting important defects that have been authenticated by framework developers. We begin by collecting defect reports from three popular frameworks and classifying them based on framework developers' ratings to build a comprehensive dataset. We then perform an in-depth analysis to uncover valuable insights. Based on our findings, we propose optimization strategies to address the shortcomings of existing approaches. Following these optimizations, we identified seven new defects, four of which were confirmed by developers as high-priority issues, with three resolved. In summary, we identified 39 unique defects across just 23 models, of which 31 were confirmed by developers, and eight have been fixed.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Understanding Everything as Code: A Taxonomy and Conceptual Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05100v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Everything as Code (EaC) is an emerging paradigm aiming to codify all aspects of modern software systems. Despite its growing popularity, comprehensive industry standards and peer-reviewed research clarifying its scope and guiding its adoption remain scarce. Aims: This study systematically analyzes existing knowledge and perceptions of EaC, clarifies its scope and boundaries, and provides structured guidance for researchers and practitioners. Method: We conducted a large-scale multivocal literature review (MLR), synthesizing academic and grey literature sources. Findings were analyzed quantitatively and thematically. Based on this analysis, we developed a taxonomy and conceptual model of EaC, validated through collaboration with industry experts. Results: The resulting taxonomy comprises 25 distinct EaC practices organized into six layers based on industry awareness and functional roles. The conceptual model illustrates focus areas, overlaps, and interactions among these EaC practices within the software delivery lifecycle. Additionally, practical code examples demonstrating the implementation of these practices were developed in collaboration with industry experts. Conclusions: This work addresses the current scarcity of academic discourse on EaC by providing the first comprehensive taxonomy and conceptual model. These contributions enhance conceptual clarity, offer actionable guidance to practitioners, and lay the groundwork for future research in this emerging domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025), Technical Papers track</p></details> |
| **[AI for the Routine, Humans for the Complex: Accuracy-Driven Data Labelling with Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just 1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtifactsBench: Bridging the Visual-Interactive Gap in LLM Code Generation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04952v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |

This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[React-tRace: A Semantics for Understanding React Hooks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05234v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>React has become the most widely used web front-end framework, enabling the creation of user interfaces in a declarative and compositional manner. Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in functional components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. In this paper, we formalize the semantics of the essence of React Hooks we name React-tRace, providing a framework that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted to OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal verification offers strong assurances of software correctness. However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03156v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice.

However, traditional testing approaches involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities, providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Deduplicating Compiler Bugs with Bisection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It allows verifying that the students correctly apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students' misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g., no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to configure. To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CompEd'25, 7 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[$T^3$: Multi-level Tree-based Automatic Program Repair with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21211v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks, establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 images, 10 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Guided Self-Debugging Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02928v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code generation is gaining significant importance in intelligent computer programming and system deployment. However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |
| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Challenges and Practices in Quantum Software Testing and Debugging: Insights from Practitioners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17306v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum software engineering is an emerging discipline with distinct challenges, particularly in testing and debugging. As quantum computing transitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present in classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited observability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific tools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software developers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews focused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants reported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing (54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31% reported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual methods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies, such as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which respondents noted do not scale well. The most frequently cited sources of bugs were classical in nature-library updates (81%), developer mistakes (68%), and compatibility issues (62%)-often worsened by limited abstraction in existing SDKs. These findings highlight the urgent need for better-aligned testing and debugging tools, integrated more seamlessly into the workflows of quantum developers. We present these results in detail and offer actionable recommendations grounded in the real-world needs of practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[MLDebugging: Towards Benchmarking Code Debugging Across Multi-Library Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13824v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code debugging is a crucial task in software engineering, which attracts increasing attention. While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios. We hope this work can uncover the potential of LLMs in multi-library debugging scenario and offer insights for future research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Hessian-Based Insights Support Fault Diagnosis in Attention-based Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07871v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity, diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis) and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRepair: An Exploratory Study on Merging Task-Specific Adapters in Code LLMs for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09568v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown high capabilities in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, 34% of reported issues are quantum-specific, highlighting the need for specialized debugging tools beyond conventional software engineering approaches. This study provides empirical insights into the software engineering challenges of quantum computing, offering recommendations to improve development workflows, tooling, and documentation.

| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Identify Flakiness in C++ Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12340v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of regression testing in software testing is crucial as it ensures that any new modifications do not disrupt the existing functionality and behaviour of the software system. The desired outcome is for regression tests to yield identical results without any modifications made to the system being tested. In practice, however, the presence of Flaky Tests introduces non-deterministic behaviour and undermines the reliability of regression testing results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for identifying the root cause of flaky tests in C++ projects at the code level, with the intention of assisting developers in debugging and resolving them more efficiently. We compile a comprehensive collection of C++ project flaky tests sourced from GitHub repositories. We fine-tune Mistral-7b, Llama2-7b and CodeLlama-7b models on the C++ dataset and an existing Java dataset and evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We assess the performance of the models across various datasets and offer recommendations for both research and industry applications. The results indicate that our models exhibit varying performance on the C++ dataset, while their performance is comparable to that of the Java dataset. The Mistral-7b surpasses the other two models regarding all metrics, achieving a score of 1. Our results demonstrate the exceptional capability of LLMs to accurately classify flakiness in C++ and Java projects, providing a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of debugging flaky tests in practice.</p></details> |  |

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM-Based Fault Localization with External Memory and Project Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03585v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 7 figures |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

However, existing debuggers are primarily tailored for human interaction, and those designed for programmatic debugging focus on kernel space, resulting in limited functionality in userland. To fill this gap, we introduce libdebug, a Python library for programmatic debugging of userland binary executables. libdebug offers a user-friendly API that enables developers to build custom debugging tools for various applications, including software engineering, reverse engineering, and software security. It is released as an open-source project, along with comprehensive documentation to encourage use and collaboration across the community. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of libdebug through case studies and benchmarks, all of which are publicly available. We find that the median latency of syscall and breakpoint handling in libdebug is 3 to 4 times lower compared to that of GDB.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |

LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

This work introduces JITScope, an interactive visualization framework that illustrates how IR nodes and instructions evolve across compilation phases. The system features a full-stack architecture: a Python-based backend transforms raw JSON-formatted IR data-representing an abstract model of the JIT compiler IR-into a normalized SQLite database; a controller layer serves processed CSV data; and a D3.js-powered frontend renders an interactive, phase-aware graph of IR node transformations. The design emphasizes modularity, traceability, and flexibility. Our roadmap explores intuitive visual representations of phase-level changes in IR node connectivity, values, and access patterns. Ultimately, JITScope lays a foundation for future tooling that enables visual exploration of IR evolution, including phase filtering, value tracking, and function-access mapping-offering a new lens into the behaviors and impacts of compiler optimizations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 8 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

The chapter considers a debugging process in which a program is tested against different test cases. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test case. The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software, GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a unique corresponding event handler.</p></details> |  |

Virtual Platforms (VPs) have become indispensable tools for this purpose as they serve as a platform to execute and debug the unmodified target software at an early design stage. With the increasing complexity of software, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, VPs need to provide high simulation speed to ensure the target software executes within a reasonable time. Hybrid simulation, which combines virtual models with real hardware, can improve the performance of VPs. This paper introduces a novel approach for integrating real Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices into SystemC-TLM-2.0-based VPs. The embedded PCI devices enable high performance, easy integration, and allow introspection for analysis and optimization. To illustrate the practical application of our approach, we present a case study where we integrate Google Coral's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) into an ARM-based VP. The integration allows efficient execution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while eliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating AI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression testing across architectures, and device communication analysis.

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Better Understanding of Probabilistic Delta Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04735v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.</p></details> | accepted by ICSE25 |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.</p></details> |  |

Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025)</p></details> |

Record and replay (R&R) tools facilitate manual and automated UI testing by recording UI actions to execute test scenarios and replay bugs. These tools typically support (i) regression testing, (ii) non-crashing functional bug reproduction, and (iii) crashing bug reproduction. However, prior work only examines these tools in fragmented settings, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across common use cases. We address this gap by conducting an empirical study on using R&R tools to record and replay non-crashing failures, crashing bugs, and feature-based user scenarios, and explore combining R&R with automated input generation (AIG) tools to replay crashing bugs. Our study involves one industrial and three academic R&R tools, 34 scenarios from 17 apps, 90 non-crashing failures from 42 apps, and 31 crashing bugs from 17 apps. Results show that 17% of scenarios, 38% of non-crashing bugs, and 44% of crashing bugs cannot be reliably recorded and replayed, mainly due to action interval resolution, API incompatibility, and Android tooling limitations. Our findings highlight key future research directions to enhance the practical application of R&R tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MobileSoft 2025</p></details> |

Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in functional components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. In this paper, we formalize the semantics of the essence of React Hooks we name React-tRace, providing a framework that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite.

ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |

Framework defects can profoundly cause disastrous accidents, thus requiring sufficient detection. In previous studies, researchers adopt DL models as test inputs combined with mutation to generate more diverse models. Though these studies demonstrate promising results, most detected defects are considered trivial (i.e., either treated as edge cases or ignored by the developers). To identify important bugs that matter to developers, we propose a novel DL framework testing method DevMuT, which generates models by adopting mutation operators and constraints derived from developer expertise. DevMuT simulates developers'common operations in development and detects more diverse defects within more stages of the DL model lifecycle (e.g., model training and inference). We evaluate the performance of DevMuT on three widely used DL frameworks (i.e., PyTorch, JAX, and Mind- Spore) with 29 DL models from nine types of industry tasks. The experiment results show that DevMuT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: it can achieve at least 71.68% improvement on average in the diversity of generated models and 28.20% improvement on average in the legal rates of generated models. Moreover, DevMuT detects 117 defects, 63 of which are confirmed, 24 are fixed, and eight are of high value confirmed by developers. Finally, DevMuT has been deployed in the MindSpore community since December 2023.

| **[Improving Deep Learning Framework Testing with Model-Level Metamorphic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04354v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) frameworks are essential to DL-based software systems, and framework bugs may lead to substantial disasters, thus requiring effective testing. Researchers adopt DL models or single interfaces as test inputs and analyze their execution results to detect bugs. However, floating-point errors, inherent randomness, and the complexity of test inputs make it challenging to analyze execution results effectively, leading to existing methods suffering from a lack of suitable test oracles. Some researchers utilize metamorphic testing to tackle this challenge. They design Metamorphic Relations (MRs) based on input data and parameter settings of a single framework interface to generate equivalent test inputs, ensuring consistent execution results between original and generated test inputs. Despite their promising effectiveness, they still face certain limitations. (1) Existing MRs overlook structural complexity, limiting test input diversity. (2) Existing MRs focus on limited interfaces, which limits generalization and necessitates additional adaptations. (3) Their detected bugs are related to the result consistency of single interfaces and far from those exposed in multi-interface combinations and runtime metrics (e.g., resource usage). To address these limitations, we propose ModelMeta, a model-level metamorphic testing method for DL frameworks with four MRs focused on the structure characteristics of DL models. ModelMeta augments seed models with diverse interface combinations to generate test inputs with consistent outputs, guided by the QR-DQN strategy. It then detects bugs through fine-grained analysis of training loss/gradients, memory/GPU usage, and execution time.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Efficient Detection of Intermittent Job Failures Using Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04173v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such as bugs. Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1 open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects, outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4 projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution - ICSME 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Compiler auto-vectorization techniques that target SIMD instructions face performance limitations due to insufficient information available at compile time, requiring programmers to manually manipulate SIMD instructions. SIMD intrinsics, a type of built-in function provided by modern compilers, enable programmers to manipulate SIMD instructions within high-level programming languages. Bugs in compilers for SIMD intrinsics can introduce potential threats to software security, producing unintended calculation results, data loss, program crashes, etc. To detect bugs in compilers for SIMD intrinsics, we propose RVISmith, a randomized fuzzer that generates well-defined C programs that include various invocation sequences of RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension) intrinsics. We design RVISmith to achieve the following objectives: (i) achieving high intrinsic coverage, (ii) improving sequence variety, and (iii) without known undefined behaviors. We implement RVISmith based on the ratified RVV intrinsic specification and evaluate our approach with three modern compilers: GCC, LLVM, and XuanTie. Experimental results show that RVISmith achieves 11.5 times higher intrinsic coverage than the state-of-the-art fuzzer for RVV intrinsics. By differential testing that compares results across different compilers, optimizations, and equivalent programs, we detect and report 13 previously unknown bugs of the three compilers under test to date. Of these bugs, 10 are confirmed and another 3 are fixed by the compiler developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |

However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing Mixed Rust with Hardware Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03344v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Rust programming language enforces three basic Rust principles, namely ownership, borrowing, and AXM (Aliasing Xor Mutability) to prevent security bugs such as memory safety violations and data races. However, Rust projects often have mixed code, i.e., code that also uses unsafe Rust, FFI (Foreign Function Interfaces), and inline assembly for low-level control. The Rust compiler is unable to statically enforce Rust principles in mixed Rust code which can lead to many security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose CapsLock, a security enforcement mechanism that can run at the level of machine code and detect Rust principle violations at run-time in mixed code. CapsLock is kept simple enough to be implemented into recent capability-based hardware abstractions that provide low-cost spatial memory safety. CapsLock introduces a novel revoke-on-use abstraction for capability-based designs, wherein accessing a memory object via a capability implicitly invalidates certain other capabilities pointing to it, thereby also providing temporal memory safety automatically, without requiring software to explicitly specify such invalidation. Thus, CapsLock is the first mechanism capable of providing cross-language enforcement of Rust principles. We implemented a prototype of CapsLock on QEMU. Evaluation results show that CapsLock is highly compatible with existing Rust code (passing 99.7% of the built-in test cases of the 100 most popular crates) and flags Rust principle violations in real-world Rust projects that use FFI or inline assembly. We discovered 8 previously unknown bugs in such crates in our experiments.</p></details> | To appear at CCS '25 |

These models often struggle with understanding the tacit knowledge embedded in systems, such as responsibility allocation and collaboration across different modules. To address this gap, we introduce the concept and framework of \textbf{Code Digital Twin}, a conceptual representation of tacit knowledge that captures the concepts, functionalities, and design rationales behind code elements, co-evolving with the software. A code digital twin is constructed using a methodology that combines knowledge extraction from both structured and unstructured sources--such as source code, documentation, and change histories--leveraging LLMs, static analysis tools, and human expertise. This framework can empower LLMs for software maintenance tasks such as issue localization and repository-level code generation by providing tacit knowledge as contexts. Based on the proposed methodology, we explore the key challenges and opportunities involved in the continuous construction and refinement of code digital twin.</p></details> | <details><summary>A vis...</summary><p>A vision paper that will be continuously updated</p></details> |

Existing static analysis tools aim to detect such errors without execution but frequently suffer from high false positive rates. Recently, unit test generation techniques offer great promise in achieving high test coverage, but they often struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without tailored guidance. To address these limitations, we present RTED, a novel type-aware test generation technique for automatically detecting Python type errors. Specifically, RTED combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to guide the test generation process and effectively suppress false positives. We evaluated RTED on two widely-used benchmarks, BugsInPy and TypeBugs. Experimental results show that RTED can detect 22-29 more benchmarked type errors than four state-of-the-art techniques. RTED is also capable of producing fewer false positives, achieving an improvement of 173.9%-245.9% in precision. Furthermore, RTED successfully discovered 12 previously unknown type errors from six real-world open-source Python projects.</p></details> |  |

Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in functional components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. In this paper, we formalize the semantics of the essence of React Hooks we name React-tRace, providing a framework that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted to OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just 1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Initially embraced by the computer science community, the versatility of LLMs has found its way into diverse domains. In particular, the software engineering realm has witnessed the most transformative changes. With LLMs increasingly serving as AI Pair Programming Assistants spurred the development of specialized models aimed at aiding software engineers. Although this new paradigm offers numerous advantages, it also presents critical challenges and open problems. To identify the potential and prevailing obstacles, we systematically reviewed contemporary scholarly publications, emphasizing the perspectives of software developers and usability concerns. Preliminary findings underscore pressing concerns about data privacy, bias, and misinformation. Additionally, we identified several usability challenges, including prompt engineering, increased cognitive demands, and mistrust.

However, concerns about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures. We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software engineering tasks. We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for each, and finally went through a short exit interview. Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant difference only in EDA phasic peaks. We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.</p></details> |  |

However, the bottleneck in software development is not writing code but understanding it; program understanding is the dominant activity, consuming approximately 70% of developers' time. This implies that improving existing code to make it easier to understand has a high payoff and - in the age of AI-assisted coding - is an essential activity to ensure that a limited pool of developers can keep up with ever-growing codebases. This paper introduces Augmented Code Engineering (ACE), a tool that automates code improvements using validated LLM output.

To mitigate the problem, substantial efforts have been devoted to understanding its characteristics and recommending alternative libraries, especially for programming language (PL) ecosystems with a central package hosting platform, such as Python (PyPI). However, to the best of our knowledge, understanding of C/C++ library migrations is still lacking, possibly due to challenges resulting from the fragmented and complicated dependency management practices in the C/C++ ecosystem. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper analyzes 19,943 C/C++ projects that utilize different package management tools and establishes the first C/C++ library migration dataset. Based on the dataset, we investigate the prevalence, domains, target library, and rationale of C/C++ library migrations and compare the results with three widely investigated PLs: Python, JavaScript, and Java. We find that the overall trend in the number of C/C++ library migrations is similar to Java. Migrations across different package management tools are also observed. In C/C++, library migrations mainly occur in GUI, Build, and OS development, but are rare in domains (e.g., Testing and Logging) that dominate library migrations in the three compared PLs. 83.46\% of C/C++ source libraries only have one migration target, suggesting that our library migration dataset could be used directly to recommend migration targets. We find four C/C++-specific migration reasons, such as less compile time and unification of dependency management, revealing the unique dependency management requirements in C/C++ projects. We believe our findings can help C/C++ developers make more informed library migration decisions and shed light on the design of C/C++ library migration tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Small Language Models for Code Generation: An Empirical Study with Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03160v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements of Small Language Models (SLMs) have opened new possibilities for efficient code generation. SLMs offer lightweight and cost-effective alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), making them attractive for use in resource-constrained environments. However, empirical understanding of SLMs, particularly their capabilities, limitations, and performance trade-offs in code generation remains limited. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 20 open-source SLMs ranging from 0.4B to 10B parameters on five diverse code-related benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, Mercury, HumanEvalPack, and CodeXGLUE). The models are assessed along three dimensions: i) functional correctness of generated code, ii) computational efficiency and iii) performance across multiple programming languages. The findings of this study reveal that several compact SLMs achieve competitive results while maintaining a balance between performance and efficiency, making them viable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, achieving further improvements in accuracy requires switching to larger models. These models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, but they require much more computational power. We observe that for 10% performance improvements, models can require nearly a 4x increase in VRAM consumption, highlighting a trade-off between effectiveness and scalability. Besides, the multilingual performance analysis reveals that SLMs tend to perform better in languages such as Python, Java, and PHP, while exhibiting relatively weaker performance in Go, C++, and Ruby. However, statistical analysis suggests these differences are not significant, indicating a generalizability of SLMs across programming languages. Based on the findings, this work provides insights into the design and selection of SLMs for real-world code generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, it is a recommended practice for developing embedded software in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, state-of-the-art mutation testing techniques for C and C++ software, which are common languages for CPS, depend on symbolic execution. Unfortunately, symbolic execution's limitations hinder its applicability (e.g., systems with black-box components). We propose relying on fuzz testing, which has demonstrated its effectiveness for C and C++ software. Fuzz testing tools automatically create test inputs that explore program branches in various ways, exercising statements in different program states, and thus enabling the detection of mutants, which is our objective. We empirically evaluated our approach using software components from operational satellite systems. Our assessment shows that our approach can detect between 40% and 90% of the mutants not detected by developers' test suites. Further, we empirically determined that the best results are obtained by integrating the Clang compiler, a memory address sanitizer, and relying on laf-intel instrumentation to collect coverage and guide fuzzing. Our approach detects a significantly higher percentage of live mutants compared to symbolic execution, with an increase of up to 50 percentage points; further, we observed that although the combination of fuzzing and symbolic execution leads to additional mutants being killed, the benefits are minimal (a gain of less than one percentage point).</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing COBOL Code Explanations: A Multi-Agents Approach Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02182v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business, and government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR, chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.</p></details> |  |

DSCodeBench consists of 1,000 carefully constructed problems sourced from realistic problems from GitHub across ten widely used Python data science libraries. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark DS-1000, DSCodeBench offers a more challenging and representative testbed, longer code solutions, more comprehensive data science libraries, clearer and better structured problem descriptions, and stronger test suites. To construct the DSCodeBench, we develop a robust pipeline that combines task scope selection, code construction, test case generation, and problem description synthesis. The process is paired with rigorous manual editing to ensure alignment and enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental result shows that DSCodeBench exhibits robust scaling behavior, where larger models systematically outperform smaller ones, validating its ability to distinguish model capabilities. The best LLM we test, GPT-4o, has a pass@1 of 0.202, indicating that LLMs still have a large room to improve for realistic data science code generation tasks. We believe DSCodeBench will serve as a rigorous and trustworthy foundation for advancing LLM-based data science programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Code Search using Natural Language Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02107v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs, learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to entry. In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to 57% and 14% on F1 scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Synthesis of Formally Verified Multi-Abstraction Function Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09550v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function summaries, which characterize the behavior of code segments (typically functions) through preconditions and postconditions, are essential for understanding, reusing, and verifying software, particularly in safety-critical domains like aerospace embedded systems. However, these mission-critical legacy code serving as a valuable reused asset often lacks formal specifications. It is challenging to automatically generate function summaries for C programs, due to the existence of complex features such as loops, nested function calls, pointer aliasing, and so on. Moreover, function summaries should support multiple abstraction levels to meet diverse requirements, e.g. precise summaries capturing full functionality for formal verification and intuitive summaries for human understanding. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel framework that combines symbolic execution, large language models (LLMs), and formal verification to generate Relatively Strongest Postconditions (RSPs) and build function summaries that fully capture program behavior. Our approach leverages VST-A's symbolic execution to precisely track program execution paths and state transitions, employs LLMs to infer loop invariants based on predefined templates, and uses Frama-C to guarantee soundness of generated summaries in an iterative refinement loop. Furthermore, from generated RSPs, we automatically synthesize strongest non-redundant postconditions expressed within given domain specific language. We compare our approach with existing work through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Structure and Semantics of Identifier Names Containing Closed Syntactic Category Words](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18444v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifier names are crucial components of code, serving as primary clues for developers to understand program behavior. This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</p></details> |

However, due to the complex software stacks involved in their development and execution, crashes are unavoidable and common. Crashes severely waste computing resources and hinder development productivity, so efficient crash recovery is crucial. Existing solutions, such as checkpoint-retry, are too heavyweight for fast recovery from crashes caused by minor programming errors or transient runtime errors. Therefore, we present DaiFu, an in-situ recovery framework for DL systems. Through a lightweight code transformation to a given DL system, DaiFu augments it to intercept crashes in situ and enables dynamic and instant updates to its program running context (e.g., code, configurations, and other data) for agile crash recovery. Our evaluation shows that DaiFu helps reduce the restore time for crash recovery, achieving a 1372x speedup compared with state-of-the-art solutions. Meanwhile, the overhead of DaiFu is negligible (under 0.40%). We also construct a benchmark spanning 7 distinct crash scenarios in DL systems, and show the effectiveness of DaiFu in diverse situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Type Inference and Automated Unit Test Generation for Python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01477v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated unit test generation is an established research field that has so far focused on statically-typed programming languages. The lack of type information in dynamically-typed programming languages, such as Python, inhibits test generators, which heavily rely on information about parameter and return types of functions to select suitable arguments when constructing test cases. Since automated test generators inherently rely on frequent execution of candidate tests, we make use of these frequent executions to address this problem by introducing type tracing, which extracts type-related information during execution and gradually refines the available type information. We implement type tracing as an extension of the Pynguin test-generation framework for Python, allowing it (i) to infer parameter types by observing how parameters are used during runtime, (ii) to record the types of values that function calls return, and (iii) to use this type information to increase code coverage. The approach leads to up to 90.0% more branch coverage, improved mutation scores, and to type information of similar quality to that produced by other state-of-the-art type-inference tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Program Optimization for the RISC-V Vector Extension Using Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01457v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, 2 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Bugs in the Shadows: Static Detection of Faulty Python Refactorings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01103v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Python is a widely adopted programming language, valued for its simplicity and flexibility. However, its dynamic type system poses significant challenges for automated refactoring - an essential practice in software evolution aimed at improving internal code structure without changing external behavior. Understanding how type errors are introduced during refactoring is crucial, as such errors can compromise software reliability and reduce developer productivity. In this work, we propose a static analysis technique to detect type errors introduced by refactoring implementations for Python. We evaluated our technique on Rope refactoring implementations, applying them to open-source Python projects. Our analysis uncovered 29 bugs across four refactoring types from a total of 1,152 refactoring attempts. Several of these issues were also found in widely used IDEs such as PyCharm and PyDev. All reported bugs were submitted to the respective developers, and some of them were acknowledged and accepted. These results highlight the need to improve the robustness of current Python refactoring tools to ensure the correctness of automated code transformations and support reliable software maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES 2025)</p></details> |

However, such a technique faces correctness problems and requires efficient repairing solutions. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study of text-to-SQL errors. Our study covers four representative ICL-based techniques, five basic repairing methods, two benchmarks, and two LLM settings. We find that text-to-SQL errors are widespread and summarize 29 error types of 7 categories. We also find that existing repairing attempts have limited correctness improvement at the cost of high computational overhead with many mis-repairs. Based on the findings, we propose MapleRepair, a novel text-to-SQL error detection and repairing framework. The evaluation demonstrates that MapleRepair outperforms existing solutions by repairing 13.8% more queries with neglectable mis-repairs and 67.4% less overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical and Evolvable Benchmark for Fine-Grained Code Instruction Following with Multi-Turn Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00699v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in code generation, yet their ability to follow complex programming instructions with layered and diverse constraints remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often prioritize functional correctness, overlooking the nuanced requirements found in real-world development. We introduce MultiCodeIF, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate instruction-following in code generation across multiple dimensions: constraint type, hierarchical levels, and iterative refinement. Built upon a structured taxonomy of 9 categories and 27 constraint types, MultiCodeIF enables granular assessment of both functional and non-functional instruction adherence. Using an automated pipeline, ConstraGen, we synthesize and evolve 2,021 code tasks sourced from 14 programming languages, supporting multi-turn evaluation through feedback-driven task variants. Empirical evaluation of six state-of-the-art LLMs uncovers substantial performance disparities. The top-performing model, Claude-3-7-Sonnet, achieves 63.0% average constraint satisfaction, while smaller models like Qwen3-1.7B fall to 44.8%. Models perform well on explicit constraints, but struggle with implicit or abstract constraints. Tasks with multiple hierarchical constraints significantly reduce model success rates, from 54.5% in single-level to just 18.8% in multi-level scenarios. However, structured feedback enables progressive improvement: average constraint satisfaction rises from 63.0% to 83.4% over four iterative refinement rounds. MultiCodeIF provides a scalable, constraint-aware, and feedback-sensitive framework to benchmark LLMs under realistic code generation scenarios, bridging the gap between synthetic evaluations and real-world instruction complexity. The full benchmark dataset, evaluation pipeline, and source code are available at https://github.com/SYSUSELab/MultiCodeIF.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Secrets Must Not Flow: Scaling Security Verification to Large Codebases (extended version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00595v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing program verifiers can prove advanced properties about security protocol implementations, but are difficult to scale to large codebases because of the manual effort required. We develop a novel methodology called *Diodon* that addresses this challenge by splitting the codebase into the protocol implementation (the *Core*) and the remainder (the *Application*). This split allows us to apply powerful semi-automated verification techniques to the security-critical Core, while fully-automatic static analyses scale the verification to the entire codebase by ensuring that the Application cannot invalidate the security properties proved for the Core. The static analyses achieve that by proving *I/O independence*, i.e., that the I/O operations within the Application are independent of the Core's security-relevant data (such as keys), and that the Application meets the Core's requirements. We have proved Diodon sound by first showing that we can safely allow the Application to perform I/O independent of the security protocol, and second that manual verification and static analyses soundly compose. We evaluate Diodon on two case studies: an implementation of the signed Diffie-Hellman key exchange and a large (100k+ LoC) production Go codebase implementing a key exchange protocol for which we obtained secrecy and injective agreement guarantees by verifying a Core of about 1% of the code with the auto-active program verifier Gobra in less than three person months.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recommending Variable Names for Extract Local Variable Refactorings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00413v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extract local variable is one of the most popular refactorings, and most IDEs and refactoring tools provide automated support for this refactoring. However, we find approximately 70% of the names recommended by these IDEs are different from what developers manually constructed, adding additional renaming burdens to developers and providing limited assistance. In this paper, we introduce VarNamer, an automated approach designed to recommend variable names for extract local variable refactorings. Through a large-scale empirical study, we identify key contexts that are useful for composing variable names. Leveraging these insights, we developed a set of heuristic rules through program static analysis techniques and employ data mining techniques to recommend variable names effectively. Notably, some of our heuristic rules have been successfully integrated into Eclipse, where they are now distributed with the latest releases of the IDE. Evaluation demonstrates its superiority over state-of-the-art IDEs. Specifically, VarNamer significantly increases the chance of exact match by 52.6% compared to Eclipse and 40.7% compared to IntelliJ IDEA. We also evaluated the proposed approach with real-world extract local variable refactorings conducted in C++ projects, and the results suggest that the approach can achieve comparable performance on programming languages besides Java. It may suggest the generalizability of VarNamer. Finally, we designed and conducted a user study and the results of the user study suggest that our approach can speed up the refactoring by 27.8% and reduce 49.3% edits on the recommended variable names.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |

| **[Are AI-Generated Fixes Secure? Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bug Fixing with Broader Context: Enhancing LLM-Based Program Repair via Layered Knowledge Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> |  |

Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety. Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.</p></details> |  |

This approach is particularly valuable for scientific computing applications in which comprehensive tests are needed to prevent flawed results or conclusions. As scientific discovery becomes increasingly more complex, domain scientists couple multiple scientific computing models or simulations to solve intricate multiphysics and multiscale problems. These model-coupling applications use a hardwired coupling program or a flexible web service to link and combine different models. In this paper, we focus on the quality assurance of the more elastic web service via a combination of rigorous specification and testing methods. The application of statistical testing exposes problems ignored by pre-written unit tests and highlights areas in the code where failures might occur. We certify the model-coupling server controller with a derived reliability statistic, offering a quantitative measure to support a claim of its robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, accepted as a regular paper to SEKE2025</p></details> |

We categorize the recent 63 LLM-based APR systems published from January 2022 to June 2025 into four paradigms, and show how retrieval- or analysis-augmented contexts strengthen any of them. This taxonomy clarifies key trade-offs: fine-tuning delivers strong task alignment at high training cost; prompting enables rapid deployment but is limited by prompt design and context windows; procedural pipelines offer reproducible control with moderate overhead; agentic frameworks tackle multi-hunk or cross-file bugs at the price of increased latency and complexity. Persistent challenges include verifying semantic correctness beyond test suites, repairing repository-scale defects, and lowering the costs of LLMs. We outline research directions that combine lightweight human feedback, repository-aware retrieval, code analysis, and cost-aware planning to advance reliable and efficient LLM-based APR.</p></details> |  |

In software development, increasing software reliability often involves testing. However, for complex and critical systems, developers can use Design by Contract (DbC) methods to define precise specifications that software components must satisfy. Verification-Aware (VA) programming languages support DbC and formal verification at compile-time or run-time, offering stronger correctness guarantees than traditional testing. However, despite the strong guarantees provided by VA languages, their adoption remains limited. In this study, we investigate the barriers to adopting VA languages by analyzing developer discussions on public forums using topic modeling techniques. We complement this analysis with a developer survey to better understand the practical challenges associated with VA languages. Our findings reveal key obstacles to adoption, including steep learning curves and usability issues. Based on these insights, we identify actionable recommendations to improve the usability and accessibility of VA languages. Our findings suggest that simplifying tool interfaces, providing better educational materials, and improving integration with everyday development environments could improve the usability and adoption of these languages. Our work provides actionable insights for improving the usability of VA languages and making verification tools more accessible.</p></details> |  |

An Experimental Study with Dafny](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22370v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Students in computing education increasingly use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. Yet, the role of LLMs in supporting cognitively demanding tasks, like deductive program verification, remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how students interact with an LLM when solving formal verification exercises in Dafny, a language that supports functional correctness, by allowing programmers to write formal specifications and automatically verifying that the implementation satisfies the specification. We conducted a mixed-methods study with master's students enrolled in a formal methods course. Each participant completed two verification problems, one with access to a custom ChatGPT interface that logged all interactions, and the other without. We identified strategies used by successful students and assessed the level of trust students place in LLMs. Our findings show that students perform significantly better when using ChatGPT; however, performance gains are tied to prompt quality. We conclude with practical recommendations for integrating LLMs into formal methods courses more effectively, including designing LLM-aware challenges that promote learning rather than substitution.</p></details> |  |

The software development for safety-critical systems necessitates rigorous engineering practices and adherence to certification standards like DO-178C for avionics. DO-178C is a guidance document which requires compliance to well-defined software coding standards like MISRA C++ to enforce coding guidelines that prevent the use of ambiguous, unsafe, or undefined constructs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in automatic code generation across a wide range of programming languages, including C++. Despite their impressive performance, code generated by LLMs in safety-critical domains must be carefully analyzed for conformance to MISRA C++ coding standards. In this paper, I have conducted a comparative analysis of the C++ code generated by popular LLMs including: OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Meta AI, and Microsoft Copilot for compliance with MISRA C++.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Deduplicating Compiler Bugs with Bisection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Among these, Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) approaches have shown great promise. Recent advances demonstrate that directly leveraging LLMs can achieve leading results. However, these techniques remain suboptimal in generating contextually relevant and accurate patches, as they often overlook repair ingredients crucial for practical program repair. In this paper, we propose ReinFix, a novel framework that enables LLMs to autonomously search for repair ingredients throughout both the reasoning and solution phases of bug fixing. In the reasoning phase, ReinFix integrates static analysis tools to retrieve internal ingredients, such as variable definitions, to assist the LLM in root cause analysis when it encounters difficulty understanding the context. During the solution phase, when the LLM lacks experience in fixing specific bugs, ReinFix searches for external ingredients from historical bug fixes with similar bug patterns, leveraging both the buggy code and its root cause to guide the LLM in identifying appropriate repair actions, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating correct patches. Evaluations on two popular benchmarks (Defects4J V1.2 and V2.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over SOTA baselines. Notably, ReinFix fixes 146 bugs, which is 32 more than the baselines on Defects4J V1.2. On Defects4J V2.0, ReinFix fixes 38 more bugs than the SOTA. Importantly, when evaluating on the recent benchmarks that are free of data leakage risk, ReinFix also maintains the best performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026.

However, these models often overlook critical security practices, which can result in the generation of insecure code that contains vulnerabilities-weaknesses or flaws in the code that attackers can exploit to compromise a system. However, there has been limited exploration of strategies to guide LLMs in generating secure code and a lack of in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of LLMs in repairing code containing vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs by examining their inherent tendencies to produce insecure code, their capability to generate secure code when guided by self-generated vulnerability hints, and their effectiveness in repairing vulnerabilities when provided with different levels of feedback. Our study covers both proprietary and open-weight models across various scales and leverages established benchmarks to assess a wide range of vulnerability types. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, we reveal that although LLMs are prone to generating insecure code, advanced models can benefit from vulnerability hints and fine-grained feedback to avoid or fix vulnerabilities. We also provide actionable suggestions to developers to reduce vulnerabilities when using LLMs for code generation.</p></details> |  |

| **[An Investigation into Maintenance Support for Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05245v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential for neural networks to augment our daily lives grows, ensuring their quality through effective testing, debugging, and maintenance is essential. This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |

Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in functional components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. In this paper, we formalize the semantics of the essence of React Hooks we name React-tRace, providing a framework that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted to OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-Context Learning as an Effective Estimator of Functional Correctness of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05200v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying LLM-based code generation to software development projects that follow a feature-driven or rapid application development approach, it becomes necessary to estimate the functional correctness of the generated code in the absence of test cases. Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating "relevance" for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative software development, where quality is defined in terms of "functional correctness". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based approach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach for code quality estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Model Mutation: How Far Are We?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17638v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) frameworks are a fundamental component of DL development. Therefore, the detection of DL framework defects is important and challenging. As one of the most widely adopted DL testing techniques, model mutation has recently gained significant attention. In this study, we revisit the defect detection ability of existing mutation-based testing methods and investigate the factors that influence their effectiveness. To begin with, we reviewed existing methods and observed that many of them mutate DL models (e.g., changing their parameters) without any customization, ignoring the unique challenges in framework testing. Another issue with these methods is their limited effectiveness, characterized by a high rate of false positives caused by illegal mutations arising from the use of generic, non-customized mutation operators. Moreover, we tracked the defects identified by these methods and discovered that most of them were ignored by developers. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the effectiveness of existing mutation-based testing methods in detecting important defects that have been authenticated by framework developers. We begin by collecting defect reports from three popular frameworks and classifying them based on framework developers' ratings to build a comprehensive dataset. We then perform an in-depth analysis to uncover valuable insights. Based on our findings, we propose optimization strategies to address the shortcomings of existing approaches. Following these optimizations, we identified seven new defects, four of which were confirmed by developers as high-priority issues, with three resolved. In summary, we identified 39 unique defects across just 23 models, of which 31 were confirmed by developers, and eight have been fixed.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

Despite its growing popularity, comprehensive industry standards and peer-reviewed research clarifying its scope and guiding its adoption remain scarce. Aims: This study systematically analyzes existing knowledge and perceptions of EaC, clarifies its scope and boundaries, and provides structured guidance for researchers and practitioners. Method: We conducted a large-scale multivocal literature review (MLR), synthesizing academic and grey literature sources. Findings were analyzed quantitatively and thematically. Based on this analysis, we developed a taxonomy and conceptual model of EaC, validated through collaboration with industry experts. Results: The resulting taxonomy comprises 25 distinct EaC practices organized into six layers based on industry awareness and functional roles. The conceptual model illustrates focus areas, overlaps, and interactions among these EaC practices within the software delivery lifecycle. Additionally, practical code examples demonstrating the implementation of these practices were developed in collaboration with industry experts. Conclusions: This work addresses the current scarcity of academic discourse on EaC by providing the first comprehensive taxonomy and conceptual model. These contributions enhance conceptual clarity, offer actionable guidance to practitioners, and lay the groundwork for future research in this emerging domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025), Technical Papers track</p></details> |
| **[AI for the Routine, Humans for the Complex: Accuracy-Driven Data Labelling with Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just 1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtifactsBench: Bridging the Visual-Interactive Gap in LLM Code Generation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04952v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Unifying Reference Model for Digital Twins of Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04871v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital twins are sophisticated software systems for the representation, monitoring, and control of cyber-physical systems, including automotive, avionics, smart manufacturing, and many more. Existing definitions and reference models of digital twins are overly abstract, impeding their comprehensive understanding and implementation guidance. Consequently, a significant gap emerges between abstract concepts and their industrial implementations. We analyze popular reference models for digital twins and combine these into a significantly detailed unifying reference model for digital twins that reduces the concept-implementation gap to facilitate their engineering in industrial practice. This enhances the understanding of the concepts of digital twins and their relationships and guides developers to implement digital twins effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supporting Software Formal Verification with Large Language Models: An Experimental Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04857v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal methods have been employed for requirements verification for a long time. However, it is difficult to automatically derive properties from natural language requirements. SpecVerify addresses this challenge by integrating large language models (LLMs) with formal verification tools, providing a more flexible mechanism for expressing requirements. This framework combines Claude 3.5 Sonnet with the ESBMC verifier to form an automated workflow. Evaluated on nine cyber-physical systems from Lockheed Martin, SpecVerify achieves 46.5% verification accuracy, comparable to NASA's CoCoSim, but with lower false positives. Our framework formulates assertions that extend beyond the expressive power of LTL and identifies falsifiable cases that are missed by more traditional methods. Counterexample analysis reveals CoCoSim's limitations stemming from model connection errors and numerical approximation issues. While SpecVerify advances verification automation, our comparative study of Claude, ChatGPT, and Llama shows that high-quality requirements documentation and human monitoring remain critical, as models occasionally misinterpret specifications. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can significantly reduce the barriers to formal verification, while highlighting the continued importance of human-machine collaboration in achieving optimal results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE 33rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)</p></details> |
| **[A Note on Runtime Verification of Concurrent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04830v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To maximize the information gained from a single execution when verifying a concurrent system, one can derive all concurrency-aware equivalent executions and check them against linear specifications. This paper offers an alternative perspective on verification of concurrent systems by leveraging trace-based logics rather than sequence-based formalisms. Linear Temporal Logic over Mazurkiewicz Traces (LTrL) operates on partial-order representations of executions, meaning that once a single execution is specified, all equivalent interleavings are implicitly considered. This paper introduces a three valued version of LTrL, indicating whether the so-far observed execution of the concurrent system is one of correct, incorrect or inconclusive, together with a suitable monitor synthesis procedure. To this end, the paper recalls a construction of trace-consistent B\"uchi automata for LTrL formulas and explains how to employ it in well-understood monitor synthesis procedures. In this way, a monitor results that yields for any linearization of an observed trace the same verification verdict.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |

Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep learning methods, have demonstrated considerable abilities when applied to the huge code bases accessible on open-source coding platforms. The so-called big code provides the basis for significant advances in empirical software engineering, as well as in the automation of coding processes and improvements in software quality with the use of AI. The objective of this paper is to facilitate a synthesis between these two significant domains of software engineering (SE), namely models and AI in SE. The paper provides an overview of the current state of AI-augmented software engineering and develops a corresponding taxonomy, ai4se. In light of the aforementioned considerations, a vision of AI-assisted big models in SE is put forth, with the aim of capitalising on the advantages inherent to both approaches in the context of software development. Finally, the pair modelling paradigm is proposed for adoption by the MDSE industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, revision after review</p></details> |

However, as digital twins become more sophisticated and integral to decision-making processes, ensuring their accuracy, reliability, and ethical implementation is essential.

The goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption, which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge sharing between teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures (2 diagrams), submitted to the workshop AMP 2025</p></details> |

ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |

Due to its high performance and efficiency, many developers use this framework. Although React library offers many advantages, it is not without its challenges. When using React library, developers often face problems where they often seek solutions through question-and-answer forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). However, despite its high popularity, many React-related questions on SO remain unanswered. Thus, this study aims to analyze the factors associated with question answerability and difficulty levels of React-related questions on SO. To facilitate our study, Exploratory Data Analysis was applied to 534,820 questions, where they are filtered based on 23 React-related tags. We implemented a quantitative approach through text mining and statistical analysis. A logistic regression model was used to identify attributes associated with question answerability, while a simple linear regression model was employed to examine the correlation between user reputations and performance difficulty scores (PD Score). The results show that some attributes, such as number of views, code snippet inclusion, number of lines of code, and user reputation, positively affect the likelihood of question answerability. In contrast, the number of comments, question lengths, and presence of images in React-related questions reduce the probability of a question receiving responses from users. Further investigation indicates a negative correlation between user reputations and PD Score, where reputation increase corresponds to -0.092 reduction in PD score, signaling experienced users tend to propose more complex technical inquiries. This study provides insights into the characteristics of technical question-and-answer platforms, such as SO, that users need to consider the answerability factors when posting questions related to React.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables, conference paper</p></details> |

Framework defects can profoundly cause disastrous accidents, thus requiring sufficient detection. In previous studies, researchers adopt DL models as test inputs combined with mutation to generate more diverse models. Though these studies demonstrate promising results, most detected defects are considered trivial (i.e., either treated as edge cases or ignored by the developers). To identify important bugs that matter to developers, we propose a novel DL framework testing method DevMuT, which generates models by adopting mutation operators and constraints derived from developer expertise. DevMuT simulates developers'common operations in development and detects more diverse defects within more stages of the DL model lifecycle (e.g., model training and inference). We evaluate the performance of DevMuT on three widely used DL frameworks (i.e., PyTorch, JAX, and Mind- Spore) with 29 DL models from nine types of industry tasks. The experiment results show that DevMuT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: it can achieve at least 71.68% improvement on average in the diversity of generated models and 28.20% improvement on average in the legal rates of generated models. Moreover, DevMuT detects 117 defects, 63 of which are confirmed, 24 are fixed, and eight are of high value confirmed by developers. Finally, DevMuT has been deployed in the MindSpore community since December 2023. These demonstrate the effectiveness of DevMuT in detecting defects that are close to the real scenes and are of concern to developers.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Improving Deep Learning Framework Testing with Model-Level Metamorphic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04354v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) frameworks are essential to DL-based software systems, and framework bugs may lead to substantial disasters, thus requiring effective testing. Researchers adopt DL models or single interfaces as test inputs and analyze their execution results to detect bugs. However, floating-point errors, inherent randomness, and the complexity of test inputs make it challenging to analyze execution results effectively, leading to existing methods suffering from a lack of suitable test oracles. Some researchers utilize metamorphic testing to tackle this challenge. They design Metamorphic Relations (MRs) based on input data and parameter settings of a single framework interface to generate equivalent test inputs, ensuring consistent execution results between original and generated test inputs. Despite their promising effectiveness, they still face certain limitations. (1) Existing MRs overlook structural complexity, limiting test input diversity. (2) Existing MRs focus on limited interfaces, which limits generalization and necessitates additional adaptations. (3) Their detected bugs are related to the result consistency of single interfaces and far from those exposed in multi-interface combinations and runtime metrics (e.g., resource usage). To address these limitations, we propose ModelMeta, a model-level metamorphic testing method for DL frameworks with four MRs focused on the structure characteristics of DL models. ModelMeta augments seed models with diverse interface combinations to generate test inputs with consistent outputs, guided by the QR-DQN strategy. It then detects bugs through fine-grained analysis of training loss/gradients, memory/GPU usage, and execution time.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Alleviating Attack Data Scarcity: SCANIA's Experience Towards Enhancing In-Vehicle Cyber Security Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02607v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log, representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy, spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study, in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world scenarios and provide insights into its application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Multi-level Feature Tree Construction for Domain-Specific Reusable Artifacts Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03946v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of open-source ecosystems (e.g., Linux) and domain-specific software projects (e.g., aerospace), efficient management of reusable artifacts is becoming increasingly crucial for software reuse. The multi-level feature tree enables semantic management based on functionality and supports requirements-driven artifact selection. However, constructing such a tree heavily relies on domain expertise, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, this paper proposes an automatic multi-level feature tree construction framework named FTBUILDER, which consists of three stages. It automatically crawls domain-specific software repositories and merges their metadata to construct a structured artifact library. It employs clustering algorithms to identify a set of artifacts with common features. It constructs a prompt and uses LLMs to summarize their common features. FTBUILDER recursively applies the identification and summarization stages to construct a multi-level feature tree from the bottom up. To validate FTBUILDER, we conduct experiments from multiple aspects (e.g., tree quality and time cost) using the Linux distribution ecosystem. Specifically, we first simultaneously develop and evaluate 24 alternative solutions in the FTBUILDER. We then construct a three-level feature tree using the best solution among them. Compared to the official feature tree, our tree exhibits higher quality, with a 9% improvement in the silhouette coefficient and an 11% increase in GValue. Furthermore, it can save developers more time in selecting artifacts by 26% and improve the accuracy of artifact recommendations with GPT-4 by 235%. FTBUILDER can be extended to other open-source software communities and domain-specific industrial enterprises.</p></details> | 9pages, 2figures |

As governments have rushed to enshrine consent requirements in their privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), significant challenges remain in understanding how these legal mandates are operationalized in software. The opaque nature of software development processes further complicates this translation. To address this, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in requirements engineering to bridge the gap between legal requirements and technical implementation. This study employs a three-step pipeline that involves using an LLM to classify software use cases for compliance, generating LLM modifications for non-compliant cases, and manually validating these changes against legal standards. Our preliminary findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating compliance tasks, while also revealing limitations in their reasoning capabilities. By benchmarking LLMs against real-world use cases, this research provides insights into leveraging AI-driven solutions to enhance legal compliance of software.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 20th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Detection of Intermittent Job Failures Using Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04173v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such as bugs. Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1 open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects, outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4 projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution - ICSME 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Initially embraced by the computer science community, the versatility of LLMs has found its way into diverse domains. In particular, the software engineering realm has witnessed the most transformative changes. With LLMs increasingly serving as AI Pair Programming Assistants spurred the development of specialized models aimed at aiding software engineers. Although this new paradigm offers numerous advantages, it also presents critical challenges and open problems. To identify the potential and prevailing obstacles, we systematically reviewed contemporary scholarly publications, emphasizing the perspectives of software developers and usability concerns. Preliminary findings underscore pressing concerns about data privacy, bias, and misinformation. Additionally, we identified several usability challenges, including prompt engineering, increased cognitive demands, and mistrust. Finally, we introduce 12 open problems that we have identified through our survey, covering these various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

Therefore, the professional assigned to carry out the design, maintenance and evolution of architectures needs to have certain knowledge and skills in order not to compromise the resulting application. Objective: The aim of this work is to understand the characteristics of the companies regarding the presence or absence of software architects in Brazil. Method: This work uses the Survey research as a means to collect evidence from professionals with the software architect profile, besides descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyze the results. Results: The study collected data from 105 professionals distributed in 24 Brazilian states. Results reveal that (i) not all companies have a software architect, (ii) in some cases, other professionals perform the activities of a software architect and (iii) there are companies that, even having a software architecture professional, have other roles also performing the duties of such a professional. Conclusions: Professionals hired as software architects have higher salaries than those hired in other roles that carry out such activity, although many of those other professionals still have duties that are typical of software architects.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multimodal Approach Combining Biometrics and Self-Report Instruments for Monitoring Stress in Programming: Methodological Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02118v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of well-being, stress and other human factors has traditionally relied on self-report instruments to assess key variables. However, concerns about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures. We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software engineering tasks. We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for each, and finally went through a short exit interview. Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant difference only in EDA phasic peaks. We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale, Independent and Comprehensive study of the power of LLMs for test case generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00225v3)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for software reliability, yet manual test creation is time-consuming and often neglected. Although search-based software testing improves efficiency, it produces tests with poor readability and maintainability. Although LLMs show promise for test generation, existing research lacks comprehensive evaluation across execution-driven assessment, reasoning-based prompting, and real-world testing scenarios. This study presents the first large-scale empirical evaluation of LLM-generated unit tests at the class level, systematically analyzing four state-of-the-art models - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B - against EvoSuite across 216,300 test cases from Defects4J, SF110, and CMD (a dataset mitigating LLM training data leakage). We evaluate five prompting techniques - Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), Few-Shot Learning (FSL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Guided Tree-of-Thought (GToT) - assessing syntactic correctness, compilability, hallucination-driven failures, readability, code coverage metrics, and fault detection capabilities. Our findings challenge prior claims that in-context learning is ineffective for test generation in code-specialized LLMs. Reasoning-based prompting - particularly GToT - significantly enhances test reliability, compilability, and structural adherence in general-purpose LLMs. However, hallucination-driven failures remain a persistent challenge, manifesting as non-existent symbol references, incorrect API calls, and fabricated dependencies, resulting in high compilation failure rates (up to 86%). Execution-based classification and mutation testing reveal that many failing tests stem from hallucinated dependencies, limiting effective fault detection.</p></details> |  |

Compiler auto-vectorization techniques that target SIMD instructions face performance limitations due to insufficient information available at compile time, requiring programmers to manually manipulate SIMD instructions. SIMD intrinsics, a type of built-in function provided by modern compilers, enable programmers to manipulate SIMD instructions within high-level programming languages. Bugs in compilers for SIMD intrinsics can introduce potential threats to software security, producing unintended calculation results, data loss, program crashes, etc. To detect bugs in compilers for SIMD intrinsics, we propose RVISmith, a randomized fuzzer that generates well-defined C programs that include various invocation sequences of RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension) intrinsics. We design RVISmith to achieve the following objectives: (i) achieving high intrinsic coverage, (ii) improving sequence variety, and (iii) without known undefined behaviors. We implement RVISmith based on the ratified RVV intrinsic specification and evaluate our approach with three modern compilers: GCC, LLVM, and XuanTie. Experimental results show that RVISmith achieves 11.5 times higher intrinsic coverage than the state-of-the-art fuzzer for RVV intrinsics. By differential testing that compares results across different compilers, optimizations, and equivalent programs, we detect and report 13 previously unknown bugs of the three compilers under test to date. Of these bugs, 10 are confirmed and another 3 are fixed by the compiler developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |

However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is It Time To Treat Prompts As Code? A Multi-Use Case Study For Prompt Optimization Using DSPy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03620v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five use cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%, using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance. Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt optimization research.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 1 figure</p></details> |

We hypothesise that privacy-focused services are typically more energy-efficient than those funded through data collection and advertising. To evaluate this, we propose a framework that systematically measures environmental costs based on energy usage and network data traffic during well-defined, automated usage scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we first analyse how underlying architectures and business models, such as monetisation through personalised advertising, contribute to the environmental footprint of these services. We then explore existing methodologies and tools for software environmental impact assessment. We apply our framework to three mainstream email services selected to reflect different privacy policies, from ad-supported tracking-intensive models to privacy-focused designs: Microsoft Outlook, Google Mail (Gmail), and Proton Mail. We extend this comparison to a self-hosted email solution, evaluated with and without end-to-end encryption. We show that the self-hosted solution, even with 14% of device energy and 15% of emissions overheads from PGP encryption, remains the most energy-efficient, saving up to 33% of emissions per session compared to Gmail. Among commercial providers, Proton Mail is the most efficient, saving up to 0.1 gCO2 e per session compared to Outlook, whose emissions can be further reduced by 2% through ad-blocking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Post-...</summary><p>Post-proceedings paper presented at LOCO '24: 1st International Workshop on Low Carbon Computing, 2024-12-03, in Glasgow, UK/Online.

However, the bottleneck in software development is not writing code but understanding it; program understanding is the dominant activity, consuming approximately 70% of developers' time. This implies that improving existing code to make it easier to understand has a high payoff and - in the age of AI-assisted coding - is an essential activity to ensure that a limited pool of developers can keep up with ever-growing codebases. This paper introduces Augmented Code Engineering (ACE), a tool that automates code improvements using validated LLM output. Developed through a data-driven approach, ACE provides reliable refactoring suggestions by considering both objective code quality improvements and program correctness. Early feedback from users suggests that AI-enabled refactoring helps mitigate code-level technical debt that otherwise rarely gets acted upon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Integrated Development Environments (AI-IDE) (2025)</p></details> |

However, its occurrence and impact within software engineering (SE) teams remains under-explored. This paper introduces a comprehensive, literature review-based taxonomy exploring the characterisation and use of humour in SE teams, with the goal of boosting productivity, improving communication, and fostering a positive work environment while emphasising the responsible use of humour to mitigate its potential negative impacts. Drawing from a wide array of studies in psychology, sociology, and organizational behaviour, our proposed framework categorizes humour into distinct theories, styles, models, and scales, offering SE professionals and researchers a structured approach to understanding humour in their work. This study also addresses the unique challenges of applying humour in SE, highlighting its potential benefits while acknowledging the need for further empirical validation in this context. Ultimately, our study aims to pave the way for more cohesive, creative, and psychologically supportive SE environments through the strategic use of humour.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to publish in Journal of Software Systems (JSS) New Idea Track 2025 (23 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification for Runtime Safety Assurance Using Causal Risk Analysis and Operational Design Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03515v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the runtime safety of autonomous systems remains challenging due to deep learning components' inherent uncertainty and their sensitivity to environmental changes. In this paper, we propose an enhancement of traditional uncertainty quantification by explicitly incorporating environmental conditions using risk-based causal analysis. We leverage Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) and fault tree modeling to identify critical operational conditions affecting system functionality. These conditions, together with uncertainties from the data and model, are integrated into a unified Bayesian Network (BN). At runtime, this BN is instantiated using real-time environmental observations to infer a probabilistic distribution over the safety estimation. This distribution enables the computation of both expected performance and its associated variance, providing a dynamic and context-aware measure of uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach through a case study of the Object Detection (OD) component in an Automated Valet Parking (AVP).</p></details> |  |

Ensuring the quality and accuracy of LLM-generated output is critical, with prompt engineering serving as a key technique to guide model responses. However, existing literature provides limited guidance on how prompt engineering can be leveraged, specifically for RE activities. The objective of this study is to explore the applicability of existing prompt engineering guidelines for the effective usage of LLMs within RE. To achieve this goal, we began by conducting a systematic review of primary literature to compile a non-exhaustive list of prompt engineering guidelines. Then, we conducted interviews with RE experts to present the extracted guidelines and gain insights on the advantages and limitations of their application within RE. Our literature review indicates a shortage of prompt engineering guidelines for domain-specific activities, specifically for RE. Our proposed mapping contributes to addressing this shortage. We conclude our study by identifying an important future line of research within this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 51st Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Securing Mixed Rust with Hardware Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03344v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Rust programming language enforces three basic Rust principles, namely ownership, borrowing, and AXM (Aliasing Xor Mutability) to prevent security bugs such as memory safety violations and data races. However, Rust projects often have mixed code, i.e., code that also uses unsafe Rust, FFI (Foreign Function Interfaces), and inline assembly for low-level control. The Rust compiler is unable to statically enforce Rust principles in mixed Rust code which can lead to many security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose CapsLock, a security enforcement mechanism that can run at the level of machine code and detect Rust principle violations at run-time in mixed code. CapsLock is kept simple enough to be implemented into recent capability-based hardware abstractions that provide low-cost spatial memory safety. CapsLock introduces a novel revoke-on-use abstraction for capability-based designs, wherein accessing a memory object via a capability implicitly invalidates certain other capabilities pointing to it, thereby also providing temporal memory safety automatically, without requiring software to explicitly specify such invalidation. Thus, CapsLock is the first mechanism capable of providing cross-language enforcement of Rust principles. We implemented a prototype of CapsLock on QEMU. Evaluation results show that CapsLock is highly compatible with existing Rust code (passing 99.7% of the built-in test cases of the 100 most popular crates) and flags Rust principle violations in real-world Rust projects that use FFI or inline assembly. We discovered 8 previously unknown bugs in such crates in our experiments.</p></details> | To appear at CCS '25 |

To mitigate the problem, substantial efforts have been devoted to understanding its characteristics and recommending alternative libraries, especially for programming language (PL) ecosystems with a central package hosting platform, such as Python (PyPI). However, to the best of our knowledge, understanding of C/C++ library migrations is still lacking, possibly due to challenges resulting from the fragmented and complicated dependency management practices in the C/C++ ecosystem. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper analyzes 19,943 C/C++ projects that utilize different package management tools and establishes the first C/C++ library migration dataset. Based on the dataset, we investigate the prevalence, domains, target library, and rationale of C/C++ library migrations and compare the results with three widely investigated PLs: Python, JavaScript, and Java. We find that the overall trend in the number of C/C++ library migrations is similar to Java. Migrations across different package management tools are also observed. In C/C++, library migrations mainly occur in GUI, Build, and OS development, but are rare in domains (e.g., Testing and Logging) that dominate library migrations in the three compared PLs. 83.46\% of C/C++ source libraries only have one migration target, suggesting that our library migration dataset could be used directly to recommend migration targets. We find four C/C++-specific migration reasons, such as less compile time and unification of dependency management, revealing the unique dependency management requirements in C/C++ projects. We believe our findings can help C/C++ developers make more informed library migration decisions and shed light on the design of C/C++ library migration tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Small Language Models for Code Generation: An Empirical Study with Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03160v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements of Small Language Models (SLMs) have opened new possibilities for efficient code generation. SLMs offer lightweight and cost-effective alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), making them attractive for use in resource-constrained environments. However, empirical understanding of SLMs, particularly their capabilities, limitations, and performance trade-offs in code generation remains limited. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 20 open-source SLMs ranging from 0.4B to 10B parameters on five diverse code-related benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, Mercury, HumanEvalPack, and CodeXGLUE). The models are assessed along three dimensions: i) functional correctness of generated code, ii) computational efficiency and iii) performance across multiple programming languages. The findings of this study reveal that several compact SLMs achieve competitive results while maintaining a balance between performance and efficiency, making them viable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, achieving further improvements in accuracy requires switching to larger models. These models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, but they require much more computational power. We observe that for 10% performance improvements, models can require nearly a 4x increase in VRAM consumption, highlighting a trade-off between effectiveness and scalability. Besides, the multilingual performance analysis reveals that SLMs tend to perform better in languages such as Python, Java, and PHP, while exhibiting relatively weaker performance in Go, C++, and Ruby. However, statistical analysis suggests these differences are not significant, indicating a generalizability of SLMs across programming languages. Based on the findings, this work provides insights into the design and selection of SLMs for real-world code generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03156v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice.

| **[Requirements Elicitation Follow-Up Question Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02858v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system. Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment. To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements elicitation interviews in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025</p></details> |

Extracting metadata from regulations to elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance. However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4% of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, Accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Business Process Management: Practitioner Perspectives on Agent Governance in Business Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03693v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of generative AI, industry interest in software agents is growing. Given the stochastic nature of generative AI-based agents, their effective and safe deployment in organizations requires robust governance, which can be facilitated by agentic business process management. However, given the nascence of this new-generation agent notion, it is not clear what BPM practitioners consider to be an agent, and what benefits, risks and governance challenges they associate with agent deployments. To investigate how organizations can effectively govern AI agents, we conducted a qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with 22 BPM practitioners from diverse industries. They anticipate that agents will enhance efficiency, improve data quality, ensure better compliance, and boost scalability through automation, while also cautioning against risks such as bias, over-reliance, cybersecurity threats, job displacement, and ambiguous decision-making. To address these challenges, the study presents six key recommendations for the responsible adoption of AI agents: define clear business goals, set legal and ethical guardrails, establish human-agent collaboration, customize agent behavior, manage risks, and ensure safe integration with fallback options. Additionally, the paper outlines actions to align traditional BPM with agentic AI, including balancing human and agent roles, redefining human involvement, adapting process structures, and introducing performance metrics. These insights provide a practical foundation for integrating AI agents into business processes while preserving oversight, flexibility, and trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Responsible BPM 2025, 15 pages including references</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Based Model Fingerprinting for LLM Similarity Detection and Family Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01631v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to verify compliance. To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94% classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fuzzing-based Mutation Testing of C/C++ Software in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24100v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mutation testing can help minimize the delivery of faulty software. Therefore, it is a recommended practice for developing embedded software in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, state-of-the-art mutation testing techniques for C and C++ software, which are common languages for CPS, depend on symbolic execution. Unfortunately, symbolic execution's limitations hinder its applicability (e.g., systems with black-box components). We propose relying on fuzz testing, which has demonstrated its effectiveness for C and C++ software. Fuzz testing tools automatically create test inputs that explore program branches in various ways, exercising statements in different program states, and thus enabling the detection of mutants, which is our objective. We empirically evaluated our approach using software components from operational satellite systems. Our assessment shows that our approach can detect between 40% and 90% of the mutants not detected by developers' test suites. Further, we empirically determined that the best results are obtained by integrating the Clang compiler, a memory address sanitizer, and relying on laf-intel instrumentation to collect coverage and guide fuzzing. Our approach detects a significantly higher percentage of live mutants compared to symbolic execution, with an increase of up to 50 percentage points; further, we observed that although the combination of fuzzing and symbolic execution leads to additional mutants being killed, the benefits are minimal (a gain of less than one percentage point).</p></details> |  |
| **[Sustainability Flags for the Identification of Sustainability Posts in Q&A Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02695v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, sustainability in software systems has gained significant attention, especially with the rise of cloud computing and the shift towards cloud-based architectures. This shift has intensified the need to identify sustainability in architectural discussions to take informed architectural decisions. One source to see these decisions is in online Q&A forums among practitioners' discussions. However, recognizing sustainability concepts within software practitioners' discussions remains challenging due to the lack of clear and distinct guidelines for this task. To address this issue, we introduce the notion of sustainability flags as pointers in relevant discussions, developed through thematic analysis of multiple sustainability best practices from cloud providers. This study further evaluates the effectiveness of these flags in identifying sustainability within cloud architecture posts, using a controlled experiment. Preliminary results suggest that the use of flags results in classifying fewer posts as sustainability-related compared to a control group, with moderately higher certainty and significantly improved performance. Moreover, sustainability flags are perceived as more useful and understandable than relying solely on definitions for identifying sustainability.</p></details> |  |

Despite the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/Joker3993/RLHGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Explainable Compliance Detection with Multi-Hop Natural Language Inference on Assurance Case Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08713v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models (LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the regulatory compliance process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Machine Collaboration and Ethical Considerations in Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02578v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both physical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to changing parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine collaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans and machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm of human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans and machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is challenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as MAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops due to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT requires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially sensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy and human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of human-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1) developing novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS, focusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into adaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for integrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models present new opportunities for automating parts of this process. This study introduces LLMREI, a chat bot designed to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human intervention, aiming to reduce common interviewer errors and improve the scalability of requirements elicitation. We explored two main approaches, zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting, to optimize LLMREI for requirements elicitation and evaluated its performance in 33 simulated stakeholder interviews. A third approach, fine-tuning, was initially considered but abandoned due to poor performance in preliminary trials. Our study assesses the chat bot's effectiveness in three key areas: minimizing common interview errors, extracting relevant requirements, and adapting its questioning based on interview context and user responses. Our findings indicate that LLMREI makes a similar number of errors compared to human interviewers, is capable of extracting a large portion of requirements, and demonstrates a notable ability to generate highly context-dependent questions. We envision the greatest benefit of LLMREI in automating interviews with a large number of stakeholders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Fair: AI-Assisted Fairness Testing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02533v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach, Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second, we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases. The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs, achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators, with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation in LLM testing.</p></details> |  |

These models often struggle with understanding the tacit knowledge embedded in systems, such as responsibility allocation and collaboration across different modules. To address this gap, we introduce the concept and framework of \textbf{Code Digital Twin}, a conceptual representation of tacit knowledge that captures the concepts, functionalities, and design rationales behind code elements, co-evolving with the software. A code digital twin is constructed using a methodology that combines knowledge extraction from both structured and unstructured sources--such as source code, documentation, and change histories--leveraging LLMs, static analysis tools, and human expertise. This framework can empower LLMs for software maintenance tasks such as issue localization and repository-level code generation by providing tacit knowledge as contexts. Based on the proposed methodology, we explore the key challenges and opportunities involved in the continuous construction and refinement of code digital twin.</p></details> | <details><summary>A vis...</summary><p>A vision paper that will be continuously updated</p></details> |

However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%, without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness of inference software execution in VFL.</p></details> |  |

Tool support could reduce the cost - and improve the quality - of test maintenance by automating aspects of the process or by providing guidance and support to developers. In this study, we explore the capabilities and applications of large language models (LLMs) - complex machine learning models adapted to textual analysis - to support test maintenance. We conducted a case study at Ericsson AB where we explore the triggers that indicate the need for test maintenance, the actions that LLMs can take, and the considerations that must be made when deploying LLMs in an industrial setting. We also propose and demonstrate a multi-agent architecture that can predict which tests require maintenance following a change to the source code. Collectively, these contributions advance our theoretical and practical understanding of how LLMs can be deployed to benefit industrial test maintenance processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

Existing static analysis tools aim to detect such errors without execution but frequently suffer from high false positive rates. Recently, unit test generation techniques offer great promise in achieving high test coverage, but they often struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without tailored guidance. To address these limitations, we present RTED, a novel type-aware test generation technique for automatically detecting Python type errors. Specifically, RTED combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to guide the test generation process and effectively suppress false positives. We evaluated RTED on two widely-used benchmarks, BugsInPy and TypeBugs. Experimental results show that RTED can detect 22-29 more benchmarked type errors than four state-of-the-art techniques. RTED is also capable of producing fewer false positives, achieving an improvement of 173.9%-245.9% in precision. Furthermore, RTED successfully discovered 12 previously unknown type errors from six real-world open-source Python projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing COBOL Code Explanations: A Multi-Agents Approach Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02182v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business, and government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR, chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.</p></details> |  |

However, existing sentiment analysis tools often perform inconsistently across datasets from different platforms, due to variations in communication style and content. In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14 sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new datasets, using their characteristic features as input. Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and statistical properties. While transformer-based models such as SetFit and RoBERTa consistently achieve strong results, tool effectiveness remains context-dependent. Our approach supports researchers and practitioners in selecting trustworthy tools for sentiment analysis in software engineering, while highlighting the need for ongoing evaluation as communication contexts evolve.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the RETRAI workshop of the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (REW 2025)</p></details> |

DSCodeBench consists of 1,000 carefully constructed problems sourced from realistic problems from GitHub across ten widely used Python data science libraries. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark DS-1000, DSCodeBench offers a more challenging and representative testbed, longer code solutions, more comprehensive data science libraries, clearer and better structured problem descriptions, and stronger test suites. To construct the DSCodeBench, we develop a robust pipeline that combines task scope selection, code construction, test case generation, and problem description synthesis. The process is paired with rigorous manual editing to ensure alignment and enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental result shows that DSCodeBench exhibits robust scaling behavior, where larger models systematically outperform smaller ones, validating its ability to distinguish model capabilities. The best LLM we test, GPT-4o, has a pass@1 of 0.202, indicating that LLMs still have a large room to improve for realistic data science code generation tasks. We believe DSCodeBench will serve as a rigorous and trustworthy foundation for advancing LLM-based data science programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Internal Software Metrics Predict App Popularity at Launch? Yeas! and Nays!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02110v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting mobile app popularity before release can provide developers with a strategic advantage in a competitive marketplace, yet it remains a challenging problem. This study explores whether internal software metrics, measurable from source code before deployment, can predict an app's popularity, defined by user ratings (calculated from user reviews) and DownloadsPerYear (yearly downloads). Using a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps from F-Droid, we extract a wide array of features, including system-, class-, and method-level code metrics, code smells, and app metadata. Additional information, such as user reviews, download counts, and uses-permission, was collected from the Google Play Store. We evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a minimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set derived via feature selection algorithms. Regression models perform poorly due to skewed data, with low $R^2$ scores. However, when reframed as binary classification (Popular vs. Unpopular), results improve significantly. The best model, a Multilayer Perceptron using the Voting set, achieves F1-scores of 0.72. These results suggest that internal code metrics, although limited in their explanatory power, can serve as useful indicators of app popularity. This challenges earlier findings that dismissed internal metrics as predictors of software quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Code Search using Natural Language Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02107v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs, learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to entry. In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to 57% and 14% on F1 scores.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexities of tech interviews are difficult to prepare for and seldom faced in computing curricula. To this end, we seek to understand how candidates prepare for technical interviews, investigating the effects of preparation methods and the role of education. We distributed a survey to candidates (n = 131) actively preparing for technical interviews. Our results suggest candidates rarely train in authentic settings and courses fail to support preparation efforts -- leading to stress and unpreparedness. Based on our findings, we provide implications for stakeholders to enhance tech interview preparation for candidates pursuing software engineering roles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Synthesis of Formally Verified Multi-Abstraction Function Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09550v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function summaries, which characterize the behavior of code segments (typically functions) through preconditions and postconditions, are essential for understanding, reusing, and verifying software, particularly in safety-critical domains like aerospace embedded systems. However, these mission-critical legacy code serving as a valuable reused asset often lacks formal specifications. It is challenging to automatically generate function summaries for C programs, due to the existence of complex features such as loops, nested function calls, pointer aliasing, and so on. Moreover, function summaries should support multiple abstraction levels to meet diverse requirements, e.g. precise summaries capturing full functionality for formal verification and intuitive summaries for human understanding. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel framework that combines symbolic execution, large language models (LLMs), and formal verification to generate Relatively Strongest Postconditions (RSPs) and build function summaries that fully capture program behavior. Our approach leverages VST-A's symbolic execution to precisely track program execution paths and state transitions, employs LLMs to infer loop invariants based on predefined templates, and uses Frama-C to guarantee soundness of generated summaries in an iterative refinement loop. Furthermore, from generated RSPs, we automatically synthesize strongest non-redundant postconditions expressed within given domain specific language. We compare our approach with existing work through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |

Naturally, studying such models' use in the context of digital twins for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a relevant area of investigation. To this end, we provide perspectives on various aspects within the context of developing digital twins for CPSs, where foundation models can be used to increase the efficiency of creating digital twins, improve the effectiveness of the capabilities they provide, and used as specialized fine-tuned foundation models acting as digital twins themselves. We also discuss challenges in using foundation models in a more generic context. We use the case of an autonomous driving system as a representative CPS to give examples. Finally, we provide discussions and open research directions that we believe are valuable for the digital twin community.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Structure and Semantics of Identifier Names Containing Closed Syntactic Category Words](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18444v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifier names are crucial components of code, serving as primary clues for developers to understand program behavior. This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</p></details> |
| **[DaiFu: In-Situ Crash Recovery for Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01628v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) systems have been widely adopted in many areas, and are becoming even more popular with the emergence of large language models. However, due to the complex software stacks involved in their development and execution, crashes are unavoidable and common. Crashes severely waste computing resources and hinder development productivity, so efficient crash recovery is crucial. Existing solutions, such as checkpoint-retry, are too heavyweight for fast recovery from crashes caused by minor programming errors or transient runtime errors. Therefore, we present DaiFu, an in-situ recovery framework for DL systems. Through a lightweight code transformation to a given DL system, DaiFu augments it to intercept crashes in situ and enables dynamic and instant updates to its program running context (e.g., code, configurations, and other data) for agile crash recovery. Our evaluation shows that DaiFu helps reduce the restore time for crash recovery, achieving a 1372x speedup compared with state-of-the-art solutions. Meanwhile, the overhead of DaiFu is negligible (under 0.40%). We also construct a benchmark spanning 7 distinct crash scenarios in DL systems, and show the effectiveness of DaiFu in diverse situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Type Inference and Automated Unit Test Generation for Python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01477v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated unit test generation is an established research field that has so far focused on statically-typed programming languages. The lack of type information in dynamically-typed programming languages, such as Python, inhibits test generators, which heavily rely on information about parameter and return types of functions to select suitable arguments when constructing test cases. Since automated test generators inherently rely on frequent execution of candidate tests, we make use of these frequent executions to address this problem by introducing type tracing, which extracts type-related information during execution and gradually refines the available type information. We implement type tracing as an extension of the Pynguin test-generation framework for Python, allowing it (i) to infer parameter types by observing how parameters are used during runtime, (ii) to record the types of values that function calls return, and (iii) to use this type information to increase code coverage. The approach leads to up to 90.0% more branch coverage, improved mutation scores, and to type information of similar quality to that produced by other state-of-the-art type-inference tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Program Optimization for the RISC-V Vector Extension Using Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01457v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, 2 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Context-Aware Code Wiring Recommendation with LLM-based Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01315v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Copy-paste-modify is a widespread and pragmatic practice in software development, where developers adapt reused code snippets, sourced from platforms such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or LLM outputs, into their local codebase. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this adaptation is code wiring, which involves substituting unresolved variables in the pasted code with suitable ones from the surrounding context. Existing solutions either rely on heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively utilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of adaptation cases are context-dependent. In this paper, we introduce WIRL, an LLM-based agent for code wiring framed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) infilling task. WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an orchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and perform context-aware substitutions. To balance efficiency and autonomy, the agent adopts a mixed strategy: deterministic rule-based steps for common patterns, and a state-machine-guided decision process for intelligent exploration. We evaluate WIRL on a carefully curated, high-quality dataset consisting of real-world code adaptation scenarios. Our approach achieves an exact match precision of 91.7% and a recall of 90.0%, outperforming advanced LLMs by 22.6 and 13.7 percentage points in precision and recall, respectively, and surpassing IntelliJ IDEA by 54.3 and 49.9 percentage points. These results underscore its practical utility, particularly in contexts with complex variable dependencies or multiple unresolved variables. We believe WIRL paves the way for more intelligent and context-aware developer assistance in modern IDEs.</p></details> |  |

However, little is known about the effectiveness and challenges in real-world AM regulation across the regulatory process -- rule operationalization, software use, and enforcement. Our multi-stakeholder study addresses this gap within workplace scheduling, one of the few AM domains with implemented regulations. We interviewed 38 stakeholders across the regulatory process: regulators, defense attorneys, worker advocates, managers, and workers. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of AM regulation is influenced by: (i) institutional constraints that challenge efforts to encode law into AM software, (ii) on-the-ground use of AM software that shapes its ability to facilitate compliance, (iii) mismatches between software and regulatory contexts that hinder enforcement, and (iv) unique concerns that software introduces when used to regulate AM. These findings underscore the importance of a sociotechnical approach to AM regulation, which considers organizational and collaborative contexts alongside the inherent attributes of software. We offer future research directions and implications for technology policy and design.</p></details> | FAccT'25 |

However, its dynamic type system poses significant challenges for automated refactoring - an essential practice in software evolution aimed at improving internal code structure without changing external behavior. Understanding how type errors are introduced during refactoring is crucial, as such errors can compromise software reliability and reduce developer productivity. In this work, we propose a static analysis technique to detect type errors introduced by refactoring implementations for Python. We evaluated our technique on Rope refactoring implementations, applying them to open-source Python projects. Our analysis uncovered 29 bugs across four refactoring types from a total of 1,152 refactoring attempts. Several of these issues were also found in widely used IDEs such as PyCharm and PyDev. All reported bugs were submitted to the respective developers, and some of them were acknowledged and accepted. These results highlight the need to improve the robustness of current Python refactoring tools to ensure the correctness of automated code transformations and support reliable software maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES 2025)</p></details> |

This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |

Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in functional components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. In this paper, we formalize the semantics of the essence of React Hooks we name React-tRace, providing a framework that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted to OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-Context Learning as an Effective Estimator of Functional Correctness of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05200v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying LLM-based code generation to software development projects that follow a feature-driven or rapid application development approach, it becomes necessary to estimate the functional correctness of the generated code in the absence of test cases. Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating "relevance" for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative software development, where quality is defined in terms of "functional correctness". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based approach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach for code quality estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Model Mutation: How Far Are We?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17638v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) frameworks are a fundamental component of DL development. Therefore, the detection of DL framework defects is important and challenging. As one of the most widely adopted DL testing techniques, model mutation has recently gained significant attention. In this study, we revisit the defect detection ability of existing mutation-based testing methods and investigate the factors that influence their effectiveness. To begin with, we reviewed existing methods and observed that many of them mutate DL models (e.g., changing their parameters) without any customization, ignoring the unique challenges in framework testing. Another issue with these methods is their limited effectiveness, characterized by a high rate of false positives caused by illegal mutations arising from the use of generic, non-customized mutation operators. Moreover, we tracked the defects identified by these methods and discovered that most of them were ignored by developers. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the effectiveness of existing mutation-based testing methods in detecting important defects that have been authenticated by framework developers. We begin by collecting defect reports from three popular frameworks and classifying them based on framework developers' ratings to build a comprehensive dataset. We then perform an in-depth analysis to uncover valuable insights. Based on our findings, we propose optimization strategies to address the shortcomings of existing approaches. Following these optimizations, we identified seven new defects, four of which were confirmed by developers as high-priority issues, with three resolved. In summary, we identified 39 unique defects across just 23 models, of which 31 were confirmed by developers, and eight have been fixed.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |
| **[AI for the Routine, Humans for the Complex: Accuracy-Driven Data Labelling with Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just 1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, it is difficult to automatically derive properties from natural language requirements. SpecVerify addresses this challenge by integrating large language models (LLMs) with formal verification tools, providing a more flexible mechanism for expressing requirements. This framework combines Claude 3.5 Sonnet with the ESBMC verifier to form an automated workflow. Evaluated on nine cyber-physical systems from Lockheed Martin, SpecVerify achieves 46.5% verification accuracy, comparable to NASA's CoCoSim, but with lower false positives. Our framework formulates assertions that extend beyond the expressive power of LTL and identifies falsifiable cases that are missed by more traditional methods. Counterexample analysis reveals CoCoSim's limitations stemming from model connection errors and numerical approximation issues. While SpecVerify advances verification automation, our comparative study of Claude, ChatGPT, and Llama shows that high-quality requirements documentation and human monitoring remain critical, as models occasionally misinterpret specifications. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can significantly reduce the barriers to formal verification, while highlighting the continued importance of human-machine collaboration in achieving optimal results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE 33rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)</p></details> |

Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep learning methods, have demonstrated considerable abilities when applied to the huge code bases accessible on open-source coding platforms. The so-called big code provides the basis for significant advances in empirical software engineering, as well as in the automation of coding processes and improvements in software quality with the use of AI. The objective of this paper is to facilitate a synthesis between these two significant domains of software engineering (SE), namely models and AI in SE. The paper provides an overview of the current state of AI-augmented software engineering and develops a corresponding taxonomy, ai4se. In light of the aforementioned considerations, a vision of AI-assisted big models in SE is put forth, with the aim of capitalising on the advantages inherent to both approaches in the context of software development. Finally, the pair modelling paradigm is proposed for adoption by the MDSE industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, revision after review</p></details> |

ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |

Framework defects can profoundly cause disastrous accidents, thus requiring sufficient detection. In previous studies, researchers adopt DL models as test inputs combined with mutation to generate more diverse models. Though these studies demonstrate promising results, most detected defects are considered trivial (i.e., either treated as edge cases or ignored by the developers). To identify important bugs that matter to developers, we propose a novel DL framework testing method DevMuT, which generates models by adopting mutation operators and constraints derived from developer expertise. DevMuT simulates developers'common operations in development and detects more diverse defects within more stages of the DL model lifecycle (e.g., model training and inference). We evaluate the performance of DevMuT on three widely used DL frameworks (i.e., PyTorch, JAX, and Mind- Spore) with 29 DL models from nine types of industry tasks. The experiment results show that DevMuT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: it can achieve at least 71.68% improvement on average in the diversity of generated models and 28.20% improvement on average in the legal rates of generated models. Moreover, DevMuT detects 117 defects, 63 of which are confirmed, 24 are fixed, and eight are of high value confirmed by developers. Finally, DevMuT has been deployed in the MindSpore community since December 2023. These demonstrate the effectiveness of DevMuT in detecting defects that are close to the real scenes and are of concern to developers.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Improving Deep Learning Framework Testing with Model-Level Metamorphic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04354v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) frameworks are essential to DL-based software systems, and framework bugs may lead to substantial disasters, thus requiring effective testing. Researchers adopt DL models or single interfaces as test inputs and analyze their execution results to detect bugs. However, floating-point errors, inherent randomness, and the complexity of test inputs make it challenging to analyze execution results effectively, leading to existing methods suffering from a lack of suitable test oracles. Some researchers utilize metamorphic testing to tackle this challenge. They design Metamorphic Relations (MRs) based on input data and parameter settings of a single framework interface to generate equivalent test inputs, ensuring consistent execution results between original and generated test inputs. Despite their promising effectiveness, they still face certain limitations. (1) Existing MRs overlook structural complexity, limiting test input diversity. (2) Existing MRs focus on limited interfaces, which limits generalization and necessitates additional adaptations. (3) Their detected bugs are related to the result consistency of single interfaces and far from those exposed in multi-interface combinations and runtime metrics (e.g., resource usage). To address these limitations, we propose ModelMeta, a model-level metamorphic testing method for DL frameworks with four MRs focused on the structure characteristics of DL models. ModelMeta augments seed models with diverse interface combinations to generate test inputs with consistent outputs, guided by the QR-DQN strategy. It then detects bugs through fine-grained analysis of training loss/gradients, memory/GPU usage, and execution time.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Alleviating Attack Data Scarcity: SCANIA's Experience Towards Enhancing In-Vehicle Cyber Security Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02607v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log, representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy, spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study, in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world scenarios and provide insights into its application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD 2025)</p></details> |

As governments have rushed to enshrine consent requirements in their privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), significant challenges remain in understanding how these legal mandates are operationalized in software. The opaque nature of software development processes further complicates this translation. To address this, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in requirements engineering to bridge the gap between legal requirements and technical implementation. This study employs a three-step pipeline that involves using an LLM to classify software use cases for compliance, generating LLM modifications for non-compliant cases, and manually validating these changes against legal standards. Our preliminary findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating compliance tasks, while also revealing limitations in their reasoning capabilities. By benchmarking LLMs against real-world use cases, this research provides insights into leveraging AI-driven solutions to enhance legal compliance of software.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 20th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL 2025)</p></details> |

| **[In-Context Learning as an Effective Estimator of Functional Correctness of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05200v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying LLM-based code generation to software development projects that follow a feature-driven or rapid application development approach, it becomes necessary to estimate the functional correctness of the generated code in the absence of test cases. Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating "relevance" for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative software development, where quality is defined in terms of "functional correctness". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based approach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach for code quality estimation.</p></details> |  |

This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supporting Software Formal Verification with Large Language Models: An Experimental Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04857v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal methods have been employed for requirements verification for a long time. However, it is difficult to automatically derive properties from natural language requirements. SpecVerify addresses this challenge by integrating large language models (LLMs) with formal verification tools, providing a more flexible mechanism for expressing requirements. This framework combines Claude 3.5 Sonnet with the ESBMC verifier to form an automated workflow. Evaluated on nine cyber-physical systems from Lockheed Martin, SpecVerify achieves 46.5% verification accuracy, comparable to NASA's CoCoSim, but with lower false positives. Our framework formulates assertions that extend beyond the expressive power of LTL and identifies falsifiable cases that are missed by more traditional methods. Counterexample analysis reveals CoCoSim's limitations stemming from model connection errors and numerical approximation issues. While SpecVerify advances verification automation, our comparative study of Claude, ChatGPT, and Llama shows that high-quality requirements documentation and human monitoring remain critical, as models occasionally misinterpret specifications. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can significantly reduce the barriers to formal verification, while highlighting the continued importance of human-machine collaboration in achieving optimal results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE 33rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Multi-level Feature Tree Construction for Domain-Specific Reusable Artifacts Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03946v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of open-source ecosystems (e.g., Linux) and domain-specific software projects (e.g., aerospace), efficient management of reusable artifacts is becoming increasingly crucial for software reuse. The multi-level feature tree enables semantic management based on functionality and supports requirements-driven artifact selection. However, constructing such a tree heavily relies on domain expertise, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, this paper proposes an automatic multi-level feature tree construction framework named FTBUILDER, which consists of three stages. It automatically crawls domain-specific software repositories and merges their metadata to construct a structured artifact library. It employs clustering algorithms to identify a set of artifacts with common features. It constructs a prompt and uses LLMs to summarize their common features. FTBUILDER recursively applies the identification and summarization stages to construct a multi-level feature tree from the bottom up. To validate FTBUILDER, we conduct experiments from multiple aspects (e.g., tree quality and time cost) using the Linux distribution ecosystem. Specifically, we first simultaneously develop and evaluate 24 alternative solutions in the FTBUILDER. We then construct a three-level feature tree using the best solution among them. Compared to the official feature tree, our tree exhibits higher quality, with a 9% improvement in the silhouette coefficient and an 11% increase in GValue. Furthermore, it can save developers more time in selecting artifacts by 26% and improve the accuracy of artifact recommendations with GPT-4 by 235%. FTBUILDER can be extended to other open-source software communities and domain-specific industrial enterprises.</p></details> | 9pages, 2figures |

Therefore, the detection of DL framework defects is important and challenging. As one of the most widely adopted DL testing techniques, model mutation has recently gained significant attention. In this study, we revisit the defect detection ability of existing mutation-based testing methods and investigate the factors that influence their effectiveness. To begin with, we reviewed existing methods and observed that many of them mutate DL models (e.g., changing their parameters) without any customization, ignoring the unique challenges in framework testing. Another issue with these methods is their limited effectiveness, characterized by a high rate of false positives caused by illegal mutations arising from the use of generic, non-customized mutation operators. Moreover, we tracked the defects identified by these methods and discovered that most of them were ignored by developers. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the effectiveness of existing mutation-based testing methods in detecting important defects that have been authenticated by framework developers. We begin by collecting defect reports from three popular frameworks and classifying them based on framework developers' ratings to build a comprehensive dataset. We then perform an in-depth analysis to uncover valuable insights. Based on our findings, we propose optimization strategies to address the shortcomings of existing approaches. Following these optimizations, we identified seven new defects, four of which were confirmed by developers as high-priority issues, with three resolved. In summary, we identified 39 unique defects across just 23 models, of which 31 were confirmed by developers, and eight have been fixed.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

| **[AI for the Routine, Humans for the Complex: Accuracy-Driven Data Labelling with Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just 1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Existing definitions and reference models of digital twins are overly abstract, impeding their comprehensive understanding and implementation guidance. Consequently, a significant gap emerges between abstract concepts and their industrial implementations. We analyze popular reference models for digital twins and combine these into a significantly detailed unifying reference model for digital twins that reduces the concept-implementation gap to facilitate their engineering in industrial practice. This enhances the understanding of the concepts of digital twins and their relationships and guides developers to implement digital twins effectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Note on Runtime Verification of Concurrent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04830v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To maximize the information gained from a single execution when verifying a concurrent system, one can derive all concurrency-aware equivalent executions and check them against linear specifications. This paper offers an alternative perspective on verification of concurrent systems by leveraging trace-based logics rather than sequence-based formalisms. Linear Temporal Logic over Mazurkiewicz Traces (LTrL) operates on partial-order representations of executions, meaning that once a single execution is specified, all equivalent interleavings are implicitly considered. This paper introduces a three valued version of LTrL, indicating whether the so-far observed execution of the concurrent system is one of correct, incorrect or inconclusive, together with a suitable monitor synthesis procedure. To this end, the paper recalls a construction of trace-consistent B\"uchi automata for LTrL formulas and explains how to employ it in well-understood monitor synthesis procedures. In this way, a monitor results that yields for any linearization of an observed trace the same verification verdict.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |

Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep learning methods, have demonstrated considerable abilities when applied to the huge code bases accessible on open-source coding platforms. The so-called big code provides the basis for significant advances in empirical software engineering, as well as in the automation of coding processes and improvements in software quality with the use of AI. The objective of this paper is to facilitate a synthesis between these two significant domains of software engineering (SE), namely models and AI in SE. The paper provides an overview of the current state of AI-augmented software engineering and develops a corresponding taxonomy, ai4se. In light of the aforementioned considerations, a vision of AI-assisted big models in SE is put forth, with the aim of capitalising on the advantages inherent to both approaches in the context of software development. Finally, the pair modelling paradigm is proposed for adoption by the MDSE industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, revision after review</p></details> |

The goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption, which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge sharing between teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures (2 diagrams), submitted to the workshop AMP 2025</p></details> |

| **[Learning Software Bug Reports: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04422v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has significantly impacted software engineering research, including bug report analysis. ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |

Due to its high performance and efficiency, many developers use this framework. Although React library offers many advantages, it is not without its challenges. When using React library, developers often face problems where they often seek solutions through question-and-answer forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). However, despite its high popularity, many React-related questions on SO remain unanswered. Thus, this study aims to analyze the factors associated with question answerability and difficulty levels of React-related questions on SO. To facilitate our study, Exploratory Data Analysis was applied to 534,820 questions, where they are filtered based on 23 React-related tags. We implemented a quantitative approach through text mining and statistical analysis. A logistic regression model was used to identify attributes associated with question answerability, while a simple linear regression model was employed to examine the correlation between user reputations and performance difficulty scores (PD Score). The results show that some attributes, such as number of views, code snippet inclusion, number of lines of code, and user reputation, positively affect the likelihood of question answerability. In contrast, the number of comments, question lengths, and presence of images in React-related questions reduce the probability of a question receiving responses from users. Further investigation indicates a negative correlation between user reputations and PD Score, where reputation increase corresponds to -0.092 reduction in PD score, signaling experienced users tend to propose more complex technical inquiries. This study provides insights into the characteristics of technical question-and-answer platforms, such as SO, that users need to consider the answerability factors when posting questions related to React.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables, conference paper</p></details> |

Framework defects can profoundly cause disastrous accidents, thus requiring sufficient detection. In previous studies, researchers adopt DL models as test inputs combined with mutation to generate more diverse models. Though these studies demonstrate promising results, most detected defects are considered trivial (i.e., either treated as edge cases or ignored by the developers). To identify important bugs that matter to developers, we propose a novel DL framework testing method DevMuT, which generates models by adopting mutation operators and constraints derived from developer expertise. DevMuT simulates developers'common operations in development and detects more diverse defects within more stages of the DL model lifecycle (e.g., model training and inference). We evaluate the performance of DevMuT on three widely used DL frameworks (i.e., PyTorch, JAX, and Mind- Spore) with 29 DL models from nine types of industry tasks. The experiment results show that DevMuT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: it can achieve at least 71.68% improvement on average in the diversity of generated models and 28.20% improvement on average in the legal rates of generated models. Moreover, DevMuT detects 117 defects, 63 of which are confirmed, 24 are fixed, and eight are of high value confirmed by developers. Finally, DevMuT has been deployed in the MindSpore community since December 2023. These demonstrate the effectiveness of DevMuT in detecting defects that are close to the real scenes and are of concern to developers.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Improving Deep Learning Framework Testing with Model-Level Metamorphic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04354v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) frameworks are essential to DL-based software systems, and framework bugs may lead to substantial disasters, thus requiring effective testing. Researchers adopt DL models or single interfaces as test inputs and analyze their execution results to detect bugs. However, floating-point errors, inherent randomness, and the complexity of test inputs make it challenging to analyze execution results effectively, leading to existing methods suffering from a lack of suitable test oracles. Some researchers utilize metamorphic testing to tackle this challenge. They design Metamorphic Relations (MRs) based on input data and parameter settings of a single framework interface to generate equivalent test inputs, ensuring consistent execution results between original and generated test inputs. Despite their promising effectiveness, they still face certain limitations. (1) Existing MRs overlook structural complexity, limiting test input diversity. (2) Existing MRs focus on limited interfaces, which limits generalization and necessitates additional adaptations. (3) Their detected bugs are related to the result consistency of single interfaces and far from those exposed in multi-interface combinations and runtime metrics (e.g., resource usage). To address these limitations, we propose ModelMeta, a model-level metamorphic testing method for DL frameworks with four MRs focused on the structure characteristics of DL models. ModelMeta augments seed models with diverse interface combinations to generate test inputs with consistent outputs, guided by the QR-DQN strategy. It then detects bugs through fine-grained analysis of training loss/gradients, memory/GPU usage, and execution time.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Alleviating Attack Data Scarcity: SCANIA's Experience Towards Enhancing In-Vehicle Cyber Security Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02607v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log, representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy, spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study, in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world scenarios and provide insights into its application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Multi-level Feature Tree Construction for Domain-Specific Reusable Artifacts Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03946v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of open-source ecosystems (e.g., Linux) and domain-specific software projects (e.g., aerospace), efficient management of reusable artifacts is becoming increasingly crucial for software reuse. The multi-level feature tree enables semantic management based on functionality and supports requirements-driven artifact selection. However, constructing such a tree heavily relies on domain expertise, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, this paper proposes an automatic multi-level feature tree construction framework named FTBUILDER, which consists of three stages. It automatically crawls domain-specific software repositories and merges their metadata to construct a structured artifact library. It employs clustering algorithms to identify a set of artifacts with common features. It constructs a prompt and uses LLMs to summarize their common features. FTBUILDER recursively applies the identification and summarization stages to construct a multi-level feature tree from the bottom up. To validate FTBUILDER, we conduct experiments from multiple aspects (e.g., tree quality and time cost) using the Linux distribution ecosystem. Specifically, we first simultaneously develop and evaluate 24 alternative solutions in the FTBUILDER. We then construct a three-level feature tree using the best solution among them. Compared to the official feature tree, our tree exhibits higher quality, with a 9% improvement in the silhouette coefficient and an 11% increase in GValue. Furthermore, it can save developers more time in selecting artifacts by 26% and improve the accuracy of artifact recommendations with GPT-4 by 235%. FTBUILDER can be extended to other open-source software communities and domain-specific industrial enterprises.</p></details> | 9pages, 2figures |

As governments have rushed to enshrine consent requirements in their privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), significant challenges remain in understanding how these legal mandates are operationalized in software. The opaque nature of software development processes further complicates this translation. To address this, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in requirements engineering to bridge the gap between legal requirements and technical implementation. This study employs a three-step pipeline that involves using an LLM to classify software use cases for compliance, generating LLM modifications for non-compliant cases, and manually validating these changes against legal standards. Our preliminary findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating compliance tasks, while also revealing limitations in their reasoning capabilities. By benchmarking LLMs against real-world use cases, this research provides insights into leveraging AI-driven solutions to enhance legal compliance of software.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 20th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Detection of Intermittent Job Failures Using Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04173v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such as bugs. Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1 open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects, outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4 projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution - ICSME 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Initially embraced by the computer science community, the versatility of LLMs has found its way into diverse domains. In particular, the software engineering realm has witnessed the most transformative changes. With LLMs increasingly serving as AI Pair Programming Assistants spurred the development of specialized models aimed at aiding software engineers. Although this new paradigm offers numerous advantages, it also presents critical challenges and open problems. To identify the potential and prevailing obstacles, we systematically reviewed contemporary scholarly publications, emphasizing the perspectives of software developers and usability concerns. Preliminary findings underscore pressing concerns about data privacy, bias, and misinformation. Additionally, we identified several usability challenges, including prompt engineering, increased cognitive demands, and mistrust. Finally, we introduce 12 open problems that we have identified through our survey, covering these various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

Therefore, the professional assigned to carry out the design, maintenance and evolution of architectures needs to have certain knowledge and skills in order not to compromise the resulting application. Objective: The aim of this work is to understand the characteristics of the companies regarding the presence or absence of software architects in Brazil. Method: This work uses the Survey research as a means to collect evidence from professionals with the software architect profile, besides descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyze the results. Results: The study collected data from 105 professionals distributed in 24 Brazilian states. Results reveal that (i) not all companies have a software architect, (ii) in some cases, other professionals perform the activities of a software architect and (iii) there are companies that, even having a software architecture professional, have other roles also performing the duties of such a professional. Conclusions: Professionals hired as software architects have higher salaries than those hired in other roles that carry out such activity, although many of those other professionals still have duties that are typical of software architects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Exploring String-Based Malware Family Classification in the Era of LLMs and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04055v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malware Family Classification (MFC) aims to identify the fine-grained family (e.g., GuLoader or BitRAT) to which a potential malware sample belongs, in contrast to malware detection or sample classification that predicts only an Yes/No. Accurate family identification can greatly facilitate automated sample labeling and understanding on crowdsourced malware analysis platforms such as VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar, which generate vast amounts of data daily. In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures. We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software engineering tasks. We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for each, and finally went through a short exit interview. Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant difference only in EDA phasic peaks. We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale, Independent and Comprehensive study of the power of LLMs for test case generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00225v3)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for software reliability, yet manual test creation is time-consuming and often neglected. Although search-based software testing improves efficiency, it produces tests with poor readability and maintainability. Although LLMs show promise for test generation, existing research lacks comprehensive evaluation across execution-driven assessment, reasoning-based prompting, and real-world testing scenarios. This study presents the first large-scale empirical evaluation of LLM-generated unit tests at the class level, systematically analyzing four state-of-the-art models - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B - against EvoSuite across 216,300 test cases from Defects4J, SF110, and CMD (a dataset mitigating LLM training data leakage). We evaluate five prompting techniques - Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), Few-Shot Learning (FSL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Guided Tree-of-Thought (GToT) - assessing syntactic correctness, compilability, hallucination-driven failures, readability, code coverage metrics, and fault detection capabilities. Our findings challenge prior claims that in-context learning is ineffective for test generation in code-specialized LLMs. Reasoning-based prompting - particularly GToT - significantly enhances test reliability, compilability, and structural adherence in general-purpose LLMs. However, hallucination-driven failures remain a persistent challenge, manifesting as non-existent symbol references, incorrect API calls, and fabricated dependencies, resulting in high compilation failure rates (up to 86%). Execution-based classification and mutation testing reveal that many failing tests stem from hallucinated dependencies, limiting effective fault detection.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

| **[In-Context Learning as an Effective Estimator of Functional Correctness of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05200v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying LLM-based code generation to software development projects that follow a feature-driven or rapid application development approach, it becomes necessary to estimate the functional correctness of the generated code in the absence of test cases. Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating "relevance" for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative software development, where quality is defined in terms of "functional correctness". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based approach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach for code quality estimation.</p></details> |  |

Despite its growing popularity, comprehensive industry standards and peer-reviewed research clarifying its scope and guiding its adoption remain scarce. Aims: This study systematically analyzes existing knowledge and perceptions of EaC, clarifies its scope and boundaries, and provides structured guidance for researchers and practitioners. Method: We conducted a large-scale multivocal literature review (MLR), synthesizing academic and grey literature sources. Findings were analyzed quantitatively and thematically. Based on this analysis, we developed a taxonomy and conceptual model of EaC, validated through collaboration with industry experts. Results: The resulting taxonomy comprises 25 distinct EaC practices organized into six layers based on industry awareness and functional roles. The conceptual model illustrates focus areas, overlaps, and interactions among these EaC practices within the software delivery lifecycle. Additionally, practical code examples demonstrating the implementation of these practices were developed in collaboration with industry experts. Conclusions: This work addresses the current scarcity of academic discourse on EaC by providing the first comprehensive taxonomy and conceptual model. These contributions enhance conceptual clarity, offer actionable guidance to practitioners, and lay the groundwork for future research in this emerging domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025), Technical Papers track</p></details> |
| **[ArtifactsBench: Bridging the Visual-Interactive Gap in LLM Code Generation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04952v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |

Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep learning methods, have demonstrated considerable abilities when applied to the huge code bases accessible on open-source coding platforms. The so-called big code provides the basis for significant advances in empirical software engineering, as well as in the automation of coding processes and improvements in software quality with the use of AI. The objective of this paper is to facilitate a synthesis between these two significant domains of software engineering (SE), namely models and AI in SE. The paper provides an overview of the current state of AI-augmented software engineering and develops a corresponding taxonomy, ai4se. In light of the aforementioned considerations, a vision of AI-assisted big models in SE is put forth, with the aim of capitalising on the advantages inherent to both approaches in the context of software development. Finally, the pair modelling paradigm is proposed for adoption by the MDSE industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, revision after review</p></details> |

Due to its high performance and efficiency, many developers use this framework. Although React library offers many advantages, it is not without its challenges. When using React library, developers often face problems where they often seek solutions through question-and-answer forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). However, despite its high popularity, many React-related questions on SO remain unanswered. Thus, this study aims to analyze the factors associated with question answerability and difficulty levels of React-related questions on SO. To facilitate our study, Exploratory Data Analysis was applied to 534,820 questions, where they are filtered based on 23 React-related tags. We implemented a quantitative approach through text mining and statistical analysis. A logistic regression model was used to identify attributes associated with question answerability, while a simple linear regression model was employed to examine the correlation between user reputations and performance difficulty scores (PD Score). The results show that some attributes, such as number of views, code snippet inclusion, number of lines of code, and user reputation, positively affect the likelihood of question answerability. In contrast, the number of comments, question lengths, and presence of images in React-related questions reduce the probability of a question receiving responses from users. Further investigation indicates a negative correlation between user reputations and PD Score, where reputation increase corresponds to -0.092 reduction in PD score, signaling experienced users tend to propose more complex technical inquiries. This study provides insights into the characteristics of technical question-and-answer platforms, such as SO, that users need to consider the answerability factors when posting questions related to React.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables, conference paper</p></details> |

As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1 open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects, outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4 projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution - ICSME 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

| **[An Investigation into Maintenance Support for Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05245v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential for neural networks to augment our daily lives grows, ensuring their quality through effective testing, debugging, and maintenance is essential. This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[React-tRace: A Semantics for Understanding React Hooks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05234v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>React has become the most widely used web front-end framework, enabling the creation of user interfaces in a declarative and compositional manner. Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in functional components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. In this paper, we formalize the semantics of the essence of React Hooks we name React-tRace, providing a framework that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted to OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-Context Learning as an Effective Estimator of Functional Correctness of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05200v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying LLM-based code generation to software development projects that follow a feature-driven or rapid application development approach, it becomes necessary to estimate the functional correctness of the generated code in the absence of test cases. Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating "relevance" for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative software development, where quality is defined in terms of "functional correctness". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based approach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach for code quality estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Model Mutation: How Far Are We?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17638v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) frameworks are a fundamental component of DL development. Therefore, the detection of DL framework defects is important and challenging. As one of the most widely adopted DL testing techniques, model mutation has recently gained significant attention. In this study, we revisit the defect detection ability of existing mutation-based testing methods and investigate the factors that influence their effectiveness. To begin with, we reviewed existing methods and observed that many of them mutate DL models (e.g., changing their parameters) without any customization, ignoring the unique challenges in framework testing. Another issue with these methods is their limited effectiveness, characterized by a high rate of false positives caused by illegal mutations arising from the use of generic, non-customized mutation operators. Moreover, we tracked the defects identified by these methods and discovered that most of them were ignored by developers. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the effectiveness of existing mutation-based testing methods in detecting important defects that have been authenticated by framework developers. We begin by collecting defect reports from three popular frameworks and classifying them based on framework developers' ratings to build a comprehensive dataset. We then perform an in-depth analysis to uncover valuable insights. Based on our findings, we propose optimization strategies to address the shortcomings of existing approaches. Following these optimizations, we identified seven new defects, four of which were confirmed by developers as high-priority issues, with three resolved. In summary, we identified 39 unique defects across just 23 models, of which 31 were confirmed by developers, and eight have been fixed.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

Despite its growing popularity, comprehensive industry standards and peer-reviewed research clarifying its scope and guiding its adoption remain scarce. Aims: This study systematically analyzes existing knowledge and perceptions of EaC, clarifies its scope and boundaries, and provides structured guidance for researchers and practitioners. Method: We conducted a large-scale multivocal literature review (MLR), synthesizing academic and grey literature sources. Findings were analyzed quantitatively and thematically. Based on this analysis, we developed a taxonomy and conceptual model of EaC, validated through collaboration with industry experts. Results: The resulting taxonomy comprises 25 distinct EaC practices organized into six layers based on industry awareness and functional roles. The conceptual model illustrates focus areas, overlaps, and interactions among these EaC practices within the software delivery lifecycle. Additionally, practical code examples demonstrating the implementation of these practices were developed in collaboration with industry experts. Conclusions: This work addresses the current scarcity of academic discourse on EaC by providing the first comprehensive taxonomy and conceptual model. These contributions enhance conceptual clarity, offer actionable guidance to practitioners, and lay the groundwork for future research in this emerging domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025), Technical Papers track</p></details> |
