| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

| **[Adaptive Request Scheduling for CodeLLM Serving with SLA Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19677v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) are increasingly integrated into modern software development workflows, yet efficiently serving them in resource-constrained, self-hosted environments remains a significant challenge. Existing LLM serving systems employs Continuous Batching for throughput improvement. However, they rely on static batch size configurations that cannot adapt to fluctuating request rates or heterogeneous workloads, leading to frequent SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations and unstable performance. In this study, We propose SABER, a dynamic batching strategy that predicts per-request SLA feasibility and adjusts decisions in real time. SABER improves goodput by up to 26% over the best static configurations and reduces latency variability by up to 45%, all without manual tuning or service restarts. Our results demonstrate that SLA-aware, adaptive scheduling is key to robust, high-performance CodeLLM serving.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCISolver: End-to-End Detection and Repair of Method-Level Code-Comment Inconsistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20558v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comments within code serve as a crucial foundation for software documentation, facilitating developers to communicate and understand the code effectively. However, code-comment inconsistency (CCI) can negatively affect software development, testing, and maintenance. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue have emerged, but existing studies often suffer from inaccurate datasets and inadequate solutions, weakening their practical effectiveness. In this study, we first conduct a quantitative analysis of existing datasets, revealing a substantial portion of sampled data are mislabeled. To address these data limitations, we introduce CCIBench, a refined dataset comprising high-quality data, to support the training and evaluation of method-level CCI methods. Furthermore, we present an innovative end-to-end LLM-based framework, CCISolver, designed to improve code quality by identifying and rectifying CCIs. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate CCISolver's superior performance. For detection, it establishes a new state-of-the-art with an F1-score of 89.54%. In fixing task, it achieves a remarkable 18.84% relative improvement in GLEU score over the strongest baseline. This superiority is confirmed by human evaluation, where CCISolver's fixing success rate of 0.6533 significantly surpasses existing methods. Critically, in a practical end-to-end setting, CCISolver's innovative architecture is approximately 36% faster for inference than the baseline model, underscoring its scalability and real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model-Driven Code Compliance Checking in Building Information Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20551v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research addresses the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual code compliance checking in Building Information Modeling (BIM) by introducing a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approach to semi-automate this critical process. The developed system integrates LLMs such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama, with Revit software to interpret building codes, generate Python scripts, and perform semi-automated compliance checks within the BIM environment. Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions, material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and cost-effective solution, this proposed approach offers a promising advancement in BIM-based compliance checking, with potential applications across diverse regulatory documents in construction projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCode: Updating Code API Knowledge with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20495v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6\% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9\% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[VulStamp: Vulnerability Assessment using Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11484v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern vulnerability detection tools enable developers to efficiently identify numerous security flaws, indiscriminate remediation efforts often lead to superfluous development expenses. This is particularly true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency. Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types, VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to train the assessment model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Attribution for Large Language Models: A Distribution Testing Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20197v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs). We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees. Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the LLM, a form of access commonly available. We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores ( $\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

| **[LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Intelligent Refactoring of Haskell Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19481v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refactoring is a constant activity in software development and maintenance. Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Guided Self-Debugging Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02928v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code generation is gaining significant importance in intelligent computer programming and system deployment. However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |
| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Challenges and Practices in Quantum Software Testing and Debugging: Insights from Practitioners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17306v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum software engineering is an emerging discipline with distinct challenges, particularly in testing and debugging. As quantum computing transitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present in classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited observability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific tools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software developers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews focused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants reported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing (54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31% reported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual methods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies, such as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which respondents noted do not scale well. The most frequently cited sources of bugs were classical in nature-library updates (81%), developer mistakes (68%), and compatibility issues (62%)-often worsened by limited abstraction in existing SDKs. These findings highlight the urgent need for better-aligned testing and debugging tools, integrated more seamlessly into the workflows of quantum developers. We present these results in detail and offer actionable recommendations grounded in the real-world needs of practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios. We hope this work can uncover the potential of LLMs in multi-library debugging scenario and offer insights for future research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Hessian-Based Insights Support Fault Diagnosis in Attention-based Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07871v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity, diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis) and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRepair: An Exploratory Study on Merging Task-Specific Adapters in Code LLMs for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09568v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown high capabilities in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, 34% of reported issues are quantum-specific, highlighting the need for specialized debugging tools beyond conventional software engineering approaches. This study provides empirical insights into the software engineering challenges of quantum computing, offering recommendations to improve development workflows, tooling, and documentation. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Identify Flakiness in C++ Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12340v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of regression testing in software testing is crucial as it ensures that any new modifications do not disrupt the existing functionality and behaviour of the software system. The desired outcome is for regression tests to yield identical results without any modifications made to the system being tested. In practice, however, the presence of Flaky Tests introduces non-deterministic behaviour and undermines the reliability of regression testing results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for identifying the root cause of flaky tests in C++ projects at the code level, with the intention of assisting developers in debugging and resolving them more efficiently. We compile a comprehensive collection of C++ project flaky tests sourced from GitHub repositories. We fine-tune Mistral-7b, Llama2-7b and CodeLlama-7b models on the C++ dataset and an existing Java dataset and evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We assess the performance of the models across various datasets and offer recommendations for both research and industry applications. The results indicate that our models exhibit varying performance on the C++ dataset, while their performance is comparable to that of the Java dataset. The Mistral-7b surpasses the other two models regarding all metrics, achieving a score of 1. Our results demonstrate the exceptional capability of LLMs to accurately classify flakiness in C++ and Java projects, providing a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of debugging flaky tests in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM-Based Fault Localization with External Memory and Project Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03585v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 7 figures |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

However, existing debuggers are primarily tailored for human interaction, and those designed for programmatic debugging focus on kernel space, resulting in limited functionality in userland. To fill this gap, we introduce libdebug, a Python library for programmatic debugging of userland binary executables. libdebug offers a user-friendly API that enables developers to build custom debugging tools for various applications, including software engineering, reverse engineering, and software security. It is released as an open-source project, along with comprehensive documentation to encourage use and collaboration across the community. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of libdebug through case studies and benchmarks, all of which are publicly available. We find that the median latency of syscall and breakpoint handling in libdebug is 3 to 4 times lower compared to that of GDB.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAMBDA: A Large Model Based Data Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17535v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large language models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

This work introduces JITScope, an interactive visualization framework that illustrates how IR nodes and instructions evolve across compilation phases. The system features a full-stack architecture: a Python-based backend transforms raw JSON-formatted IR data-representing an abstract model of the JIT compiler IR-into a normalized SQLite database; a controller layer serves processed CSV data; and a D3.js-powered frontend renders an interactive, phase-aware graph of IR node transformations. The design emphasizes modularity, traceability, and flexibility. Our roadmap explores intuitive visual representations of phase-level changes in IR node connectivity, values, and access patterns. Ultimately, JITScope lays a foundation for future tooling that enables visual exploration of IR evolution, including phase filtering, value tracking, and function-access mapping-offering a new lens into the behaviors and impacts of compiler optimizations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 8 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

The chapter considers a debugging process in which a program is tested against different test cases. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test case. The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software, GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a unique corresponding event handler.</p></details> |  |

Virtual Platforms (VPs) have become indispensable tools for this purpose as they serve as a platform to execute and debug the unmodified target software at an early design stage. With the increasing complexity of software, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, VPs need to provide high simulation speed to ensure the target software executes within a reasonable time. Hybrid simulation, which combines virtual models with real hardware, can improve the performance of VPs. This paper introduces a novel approach for integrating real Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices into SystemC-TLM-2.0-based VPs. The embedded PCI devices enable high performance, easy integration, and allow introspection for analysis and optimization. To illustrate the practical application of our approach, we present a case study where we integrate Google Coral's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) into an ARM-based VP. The integration allows efficient execution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while eliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating AI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression testing across architectures, and device communication analysis. Our findings demonstrate that embedding PCI devices into SystemC simulations significantly enhances</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the 25th International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation (SAMOS XXV)</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Mutation-based Fault Localization for Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09059v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to execute operations. They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Better Understanding of Probabilistic Delta Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04735v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.</p></details> | accepted by ICSE25 |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.</p></details> |  |

Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025)</p></details> |

Exploring the Use of Android Record & Replay Tools in Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20237v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android User Interface (UI) testing is a critical research area due to the ubiquity of apps and the challenges faced by developers. Record and replay (R&R) tools facilitate manual and automated UI testing by recording UI actions to execute test scenarios and replay bugs. These tools typically support (i) regression testing, (ii) non-crashing functional bug reproduction, and (iii) crashing bug reproduction. However, prior work only examines these tools in fragmented settings, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across common use cases. We address this gap by conducting an empirical study on using R&R tools to record and replay non-crashing failures, crashing bugs, and feature-based user scenarios, and explore combining R&R with automated input generation (AIG) tools to replay crashing bugs. Our study involves one industrial and three academic R&R tools, 34 scenarios from 17 apps, 90 non-crashing failures from 42 apps, and 31 crashing bugs from 17 apps. Results show that 17% of scenarios, 38% of non-crashing bugs, and 44% of crashing bugs cannot be reliably recorded and replayed, mainly due to action interval resolution, API incompatibility, and Android tooling limitations. Our findings highlight key future research directions to enhance the practical application of R&R tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MobileSoft 2025</p></details> |

Put some Whamm on it!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20192v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and monitoring programs are integral to engineering and deploying software. Dynamic analyses monitor applications through source code or IR injection, machine code or bytecode rewriting, and virtual machine or direct hardware support. While these techniques are viable within their respective domains, common tooling across techniques is rare, leading to fragmentation of skills, duplicated efforts, and inconsistent feature support. We address this problem in the WebAssembly ecosystem with Whamm, a declarative instrumentation DSL for WebAssembly that abstracts above the instrumentation strategy, leveraging bytecode rewriting and engine support as available. Whamm solves three problems: 1) tooling fragmentation, 2) prohibitive instrumentation overhead of general-purpose frameworks, and 3) tedium of tailoring low-level high-performance mechanisms. Whamm provides fully-programmable instrumentation with declarative match rules, static and dynamic predication, automatic state reporting, and user library support, while achieving high performance through compiler and engine optimizations. At the back end, Whamm provides instrumentation to a Wasm engine as Wasm code, reusing existing engine optimizations and unlocking new ones, most notably intrinsification, to minimize overhead. In particular, explicitly requesting program state in match rules, rather than reflection, enables the engine to efficiently bundle arguments and even inline compiled probe logic. Whamm streamlines the tooling effort, as its bytecode-rewriting target can run instrumented programs everywhere, lowering fragmentation and advancing the state of the art for engine support. We evaluate Whamm with case studies of non-trivial monitors and show it is expressive, powerful, and efficient.</p></details> |  |

However, the application of LLMs to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging. Unlike existing methods, VeriDebug employs an embedding-based technique to accurately retrieve internal information, followed by bug-fixing. VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves 64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo (36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of various large language models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA, GEMINI, and GPT-4o in interpreting such visual inputs. We employ prompt engineering techniques, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot learning, to assess each model's responsiveness and accuracy. Our findings show that while GPT-4o shows promising capabilities, achieving over 60% similarity to baseline questions for 51.75% of the tested images, challenges remain in obtaining consistent and accurate interpretations for more complex images. This research advances our understanding of the feasibility of using generative AI for image-centric problem-solving in developer communities, highlighting both the potential benefits and current limitations of this approach while envisioning a future where visual-based debugging copilot tools become a reality.</p></details> |  |

Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability, especially their error rates across domains and the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o). Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025. Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error distributions. Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50% with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%. Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over 50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates (~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability (10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability. Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from biological healing - where the human body detects damage, signals the brain, and activates targeted recovery - this paper explores the concept of self-healing software driven by artificial intelligence. We propose a novel framework that mimics this biological model system observability tools serve as sensory inputs, AI models function as the cognitive core for diagnosis and repair, and healing agents apply targeted code and test modifications. By combining log analysis, static code inspection, and AI-driven generation of patches or test updates, our approach aims to reduce downtime, accelerate debugging, and enhance software resilience. We evaluate the effectiveness of this model through case studies and simulations, comparing it against traditional manual debugging and recovery workflows. This work paves the way toward intelligent, adaptive and self-reliant software systems capable of continuous healing, akin to living organisms.</p></details> |  |

By introducing a complex search process during inference, type classes can lead to wholly inscrutable or useless errors. We describe a system, Argus, for interactively visualizing type class inferences to help programmers debug inference failures, applied specifically to Rust's trait system. The core insight of Argus is to avoid the traditional model of compiler diagnostics as one-size-fits-all, instead providing the programmer with different views on the search tree corresponding to different debugging goals. Argus carefully uses defaults to improve debugging productivity, including interface design (e.g., not showing full paths of types by default) and heuristics (e.g., sorting obligations based on the expected complexity of fixing them). We evaluated Argus in a user study where $N = 25$ participants debugged type inference failures in realistic Rust programs, finding that participants using Argus correctly localized $2.2\times$ as many faults and localized $3.3\times$ faster compared to not using Argus.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous approaches, notes in Codetations stay outside the document to prevent code clutter, attaching to spans in the document using a hybrid edit-tracking/LLM-based method. Their content is dynamic, interactive, and synchronized with code changes. A worked example shows that relevant notes with interactively-collected data improve LLM performance during code repair. In our user evaluation, developers praised these properties and saw significant potential in annotation types that we generated with an LLM in just a few minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design, where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix, we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct their software goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, FSE2025</p></details> |

Diffing Build Logs with CiDiff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18182v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous integration (CI) is widely used by developers to ensure the quality and reliability of their software projects. However, diagnosing a CI regression is a tedious process that involves the manual analysis of lengthy build logs. In this paper, we explore how textual differencing can support the debugging of CI regressions. As off-the-shelf diff algorithms produce suboptimal results, in this work we introduce a new diff algorithm specifically tailored to build logs called CiDiff. We evaluate CiDiff against several baselines on a novel dataset of 17 906 CI regressions, performing an accuracy study, a quantitative study and a user-study. Notably, our algorithm reduces the number of lines to inspect by about 60 % in the median case, with reasonable overhead compared to the state-of-practice LCS-diff. Finally, our algorithm is preferred by the majority of participants in 70 % of the regression cases, whereas LCS-diff is preferred in only 5 % of the cases.</p></details> |  |

LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

These systems offer a range of essential features, including modularity, abstraction, interoperability, workflow composition tools, resource management, error handling, and comprehensive documentation. Utilizing these frameworks accelerates the development of scientific computing, resulting in more efficient and reproducible research outcomes. However, developing a user-friendly, efficient, and adaptable SWS poses several challenges. This study explores these challenges through an in-depth analysis of interactions on Stack Overflow (SO) and GitHub, key platforms where developers and researchers discuss and resolve issues. In particular, we leverage topic modeling (BERTopic) to understand the topics SWSs developers discuss on these platforms. We identified 10 topics developers discuss on SO (e.g., Workflow Creation and Scheduling, Data Structures and Operations, Workflow Execution) and found that workflow execution is the most challenging. By analyzing GitHub issues, we identified 13 topics (e.g., Errors and Bug Fixing, Documentation, Dependencies) and discovered that data structures and operations is the most difficult. We also found common topics between SO and GitHub, such as data structures and operations, task management, and workflow scheduling. Additionally, we categorized each topic by type (How, Why, What, and Others). We observed that the How type consistently dominates across all topics, indicating a need for procedural guidance among developers. The dominance of the How type is also evident in domains like Chatbots and Mobile development. Our study will guide future research in proposing tools and techniques to help the community overcome the challenges developers face when developing SWSs.</p></details> | 58 pages |
| **[VFArchē: A Dual-Mode Framework for Locating Vulnerable Functions in Open-Source Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18050v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Composition Analysis (SCA) has become pivotal in addressing vulnerabilities inherent in software project dependencies. In particular, reachability analysis is increasingly used in Open-Source Software (OSS) projects to identify reachable vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) through call graphs, enabling a focus on exploitable risks. Performing reachability analysis typically requires the vulnerable function (VF) to track the call chains from downstream applications. However, such crucial information is usually unavailable in modern vulnerability databases like NVD. While directly extracting VF from modified functions in vulnerability patches is intuitive, patches are not always available. Moreover, our preliminary study shows that over 26% of VF do not exist in the modified functions. Meanwhile, simply ignoring patches to search vulnerable functions suffers from overwhelming noises and lexical gaps between descriptions and source code. Given that almost half of the vulnerabilities are equipped with patches, a holistic solution that handles both scenarios with and without patches is required. To meet real-world needs and automatically localize VF, we present VFArch\=e, a dual-mode approach designed for disclosed vulnerabilities, applicable in scenarios with or without available patch links. The experimental results of VFArch\=e on our constructed benchmark dataset demonstrate significant efficacy regarding three metrics, achieving 1.3x and 1.9x Mean Reciprocal Rank over the best baselines for Patch-present and Patch-absent modes, respectively. Moreover, VFArch\=e has proven its applicability in real-world scenarios by successfully locating VF for 43 out of 50 latest vulnerabilities with reasonable efforts and significantly reducing 78-89% false positives of SCA tools.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, the behaviors of NPC vehicles in these scenarios generated by previous approaches are predefined and mutated before simulation execution, ignoring traffic signals and the behaviors of the Ego vehicle. Thus, a large number of the violations they found are induced by unrealistic behaviors of NPC vehicles, revealing no bugs of ADSs. Besides, the vast scenario search space of NPC behaviors during the iterative mutations limits the efficiency of previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a novel scenario-based testing framework, DynNPC, to generate more violation scenarios induced by the ADS. Specifically, DynNPC allows NPC vehicles to dynamically generate behaviors using different driving strategies during simulation execution based on traffic signals and the real-time behavior of the Ego vehicle. We compare DynNPC with five state-of-the-art scenario-based testing approaches. Our evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of DynNPC in finding more violation scenarios induced by the ADS.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroupTuner: Efficient Group-Aware Compiler Auto-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08598v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern compilers typically provide hundreds of options to optimize program performance, but users often cannot fully leverage them due to the huge number of options. While standard optimization combinations (e.g., -O3) provide reasonable defaults, they often fail to deliver near-peak performance across diverse programs and architectures. To address this challenge, compiler auto-tuning techniques have emerged to automate the discovery of improved option combinations. Existing techniques typically focus on identifying critical options and prioritizing them during the search to improve efficiency. However, due to limited tuning iterations, the resulting data is often sparse and noisy, making it highly challenging to accurately identify critical options. As a result, these algorithms are prone to being trapped in local optima. To address this limitation, we propose GroupTuner, a group-aware auto-tuning technique that directly applies localized mutation to coherent option groups based on historically best-performing combinations, thus avoiding explicitly identifying critical options. By forgoing the need to know precisely which options are most important, GroupTuner maximizes the use of existing performance data, ensuring more targeted exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTuner can efficiently discover competitive option combinations, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.39% over -O3 while requiring only 77.21% of the time compared to the random search algorithm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in the ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES'25), June 16-17, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea</p></details> |
| **[Breaking Single-Tester Limits: Multi-Agent LLMs for Multi-User Feature Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17539v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing dependence on mobile phones and their apps has made multi-user interactive features, like chat calls, live streaming, and video conferencing, indispensable for bridging the gaps in social connectivity caused by physical and situational barriers. However, automating these interactive features for testing is fraught with challenges, owing to their inherent need for timely, dynamic, and collaborative user interactions, which current automated testing methods inadequately address. Inspired by the concept of agents designed to autonomously and collaboratively tackle problems, we propose MAdroid, a novel multi-agent approach powered by the Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the multi-user interactive task for app feature testing. Specifically, MAdroid employs two functional types of multi-agents: user agents (Operator) and supervisor agents (Coordinator and Observer). Each agent takes a specific role: the Coordinator directs the interactive task; the Operator mimics user interactions on the device; and the Observer monitors and reviews the task automation process. Our evaluation, which included 41 multi-user interactive tasks, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 82.9% of the tasks with 96.8% action similarity, outperforming the ablation studies and state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a preliminary investigation underscores MAdroid's practicality by helping identify 11 multi-user interactive bugs during regression app testing, confirming its potential value in real-world software development contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2504.15474</p></details> |

We present cuVSLAM, a state-of-the-art solution for visual simultaneous localization and mapping, which can operate with a variety of visual-inertial sensor suites, including multiple RGB and depth cameras, and inertial measurement units. cuVSLAM supports operation with as few as one RGB camera to as many as 32 cameras, in arbitrary geometric configurations, thus supporting a wide range of robotic setups. cuVSLAM is specifically optimized using CUDA to deploy in real-time applications with minimal computational overhead on edge-computing devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson. We present the design and implementation of cuVSLAM, example use cases, and empirical results on several state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrating the best-in-class performance of cuVSLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of Input Order Bias on Large Language Models for Software Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18750v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in software engineering tasks such as Fault Localization (FL) and Automatic Program Repair (APR). This study investigates how input order and context size influence LLM performance in FL, a crucial step for many downstream software engineering tasks. We evaluate different method orderings using Kendall Tau distances, including "perfect" (where ground truths appear first) and "worst" (where ground truths appear last), across two benchmarks containing Java and Python projects. Our results reveal a strong order bias: in Java projects, Top-1 FL accuracy drops from 57% to 20% when reversing the order, while in Python projects, it decreases from 38% to approximately 3%. However, segmenting inputs into smaller contexts mitigates this bias, reducing the performance gap in FL from 22% and 6% to just 1% across both benchmarks. We replaced method names with semantically meaningful alternatives to determine whether this bias is due to data leakage. The observed trends remained consistent, suggesting that the bias is not caused by memorization from training data but rather by the inherent effect of input order. Additionally, we explored ordering methods based on traditional FL techniques and metrics, finding that DepGraph's ranking achieves 48% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming simpler approaches such as CallGraph(DFS). These findings highlight the importance of structuring inputs, managing context effectively, and selecting appropriate ordering strategies to enhance LLM performance in FL and other software engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORTAR: Multi-turn Metamorphic Testing for LLM-based Dialogue Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15557v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of LLM-based dialogue systems in daily life, quality assurance has become more important than ever. Recent research has successfully introduced methods to identify unexpected behaviour in single-turn testing scenarios. However, multi-turn interaction is the common real-world usage of dialogue systems, yet testing methods for such interactions remain underexplored. This is largely due to the oracle problem in multi-turn testing, which continues to pose a significant challenge for dialogue system developers and researchers. In this paper, we propose MORTAR, a metamorphic multi-turn dialogue testing approach, which mitigates the test oracle problem in testing LLM-based dialogue systems. MORTAR formalises the multi-turn testing for dialogue systems, and automates the generation of question-answer dialogue test cases with multiple dialogue-level perturbations and metamorphic relations (MRs). The automated MR matching mechanism allows MORTAR more flexibility and efficiency in metamorphic testing. The proposed approach is fully automated without reliance on LLM judges. In testing six popular LLM-based dialogue systems, MORTAR reaches significantly better effectiveness with over 150\% more bugs revealed per test case when compared to the single-turn metamorphic testing baseline. Regarding the quality of bugs, MORTAR reveals higher-quality bugs in terms of diversity, precision and uniqueness. MORTAR is expected to inspire more multi-turn testing approaches, and assist developers in evaluating the dialogue system performance more comprehensively with constrained test resources and budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

Bug localization, the process of pinpointing the exact source code files that need modification, is crucial in reducing this effort. Existing bug localization tools, typically reliant on deep learning techniques, face limitations in cross-project applicability and effectiveness in multi-language environments. Recent advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) offer detailed representations for bug localization. However, they encounter challenges with limited context windows and mapping accuracy. To address these issues, we propose BLAZE, an approach that employs dynamic chunking and hard example learning. First, BLAZE dynamically segments source code to minimize continuity loss. Then, BLAZE fine-tunes a GPT-based model using challenging bug cases, in order to enhance cross-project and cross-language bug localization. To support the capability of BLAZE, we create the BEETLEBOX dataset, which comprises 26,321 bugs from 29 large and thriving open-source projects across five different programming languages (Java, C++, Python, Go, and JavaScript). Our evaluations of BLAZE on three benchmark datasets BEETLEBOX, SWE-Bench, and Ye et al. demonstrate substantial improvements compared to six state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, BLAZE achieves up to an increase of 120% in Top 1 accuracy, 144% in Mean Average Precision (MAP), and 100% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). An extensive ablation study confirms the contributions of our pipeline components to the overall performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Call Me Maybe: Enhancing JavaScript Call Graph Construction using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18191v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues. A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features, existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges (150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases, reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, code-comment inconsistency (CCI) can negatively affect software development, testing, and maintenance. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue have emerged, but existing studies often suffer from inaccurate datasets and inadequate solutions, weakening their practical effectiveness. In this study, we first conduct a quantitative analysis of existing datasets, revealing a substantial portion of sampled data are mislabeled. To address these data limitations, we introduce CCIBench, a refined dataset comprising high-quality data, to support the training and evaluation of method-level CCI methods. Furthermore, we present an innovative end-to-end LLM-based framework, CCISolver, designed to improve code quality by identifying and rectifying CCIs.

In fixing task, it achieves a remarkable 18.84% relative improvement in GLEU score over the strongest baseline. This superiority is confirmed by human evaluation, where CCISolver's fixing success rate of 0.6533 significantly surpasses existing methods.

As modern systems grow in complexity, knowledge sharing and collaboration across teams have become essential. However, despite well-documented benefits of PP, its adoption remains inconsistent across software teams. Objective: This study aims to understand the factors that facilitate or hinder team members' adoption as well as lasting engagement in PP. Method: We have conducted an exploratory single-case study in a mature agile company in Norway. We collected data through two rounds of interviews with team members in different roles and performed a thematic analysis of the interviews. Results: Our key finding is that multiple factors, related to the perceptions of how PP contributes to daily work, efforts associated with engaging in PP sessions, company and team attitudes, resources, infrastructure, and task characteristics, affect PP engagement. Conclusion: Long-term engagement in PP requires expected benefits with the practice being confirmed in firsthand experiences. Adapting the practice to each unique team, with insights drawn from collective learning, is also beneficial.

Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms.

| **[Generating and Understanding Tests via Path-Aware Symbolic Execution with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19287v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering systematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code including library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead constructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the first to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are actually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and visualization of their path profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroupTuner: Efficient Group-Aware Compiler Auto-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08598v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern compilers typically provide hundreds of options to optimize program performance, but users often cannot fully leverage them due to the huge number of options. While standard optimization combinations (e.g., -O3) provide reasonable defaults, they often fail to deliver near-peak performance across diverse programs and architectures. To address this challenge, compiler auto-tuning techniques have emerged to automate the discovery of improved option combinations. Existing techniques typically focus on identifying critical options and prioritizing them during the search to improve efficiency. However, due to limited tuning iterations, the resulting data is often sparse and noisy, making it highly challenging to accurately identify critical options. As a result, these algorithms are prone to being trapped in local optima. To address this limitation, we propose GroupTuner, a group-aware auto-tuning technique that directly applies localized mutation to coherent option groups based on historically best-performing combinations, thus avoiding explicitly identifying critical options. By forgoing the need to know precisely which options are most important, GroupTuner maximizes the use of existing performance data, ensuring more targeted exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTuner can efficiently discover competitive option combinations, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.39% over -O3 while requiring only 77.21% of the time compared to the random search algorithm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in the ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES'25), June 16-17, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Software Engineering Agents: A Study of Thought-Action-Result Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18824v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate complex software engineering tasks such as program repair and issue resolution. These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent}, \textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust autonomous software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Impact of Input Order Bias on Large Language Models for Software Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18750v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in software engineering tasks such as Fault Localization (FL) and Automatic Program Repair (APR). This study investigates how input order and context size influence LLM performance in FL, a crucial step for many downstream software engineering tasks. We evaluate different method orderings using Kendall Tau distances, including "perfect" (where ground truths appear first) and "worst" (where ground truths appear last), across two benchmarks containing Java and Python projects. Our results reveal a strong order bias: in Java projects, Top-1 FL accuracy drops from 57% to 20% when reversing the order, while in Python projects, it decreases from 38% to approximately 3%. However, segmenting inputs into smaller contexts mitigates this bias, reducing the performance gap in FL from 22% and 6% to just 1% across both benchmarks. We replaced method names with semantically meaningful alternatives to determine whether this bias is due to data leakage. The observed trends remained consistent, suggesting that the bias is not caused by memorization from training data but rather by the inherent effect of input order. Additionally, we explored ordering methods based on traditional FL techniques and metrics, finding that DepGraph's ranking achieves 48% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming simpler approaches such as CallGraph(DFS). These findings highlight the importance of structuring inputs, managing context effectively, and selecting appropriate ordering strategies to enhance LLM performance in FL and other software engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

In software engineering, they recently gained attention in code assistants, which generate programs from a natural language task description (prompt). They have the potential to save time and effort but remain poorly understood, limiting their optimal use. In this article, we investigate the impact of input variations on two configurations of a language model, focusing on parameters such as task description, surrounding context, model creativity, and the number of generated solutions. We design specific operators to modify these inputs and apply them to three LLM-based code assistants (Copilot, Codex, StarCoder2) and two benchmarks representing algorithmic problems (HumanEval, LeetCode). Our study examines whether these variations significantly affect program quality and how these effects generalize across models. Our results show that varying input parameters can greatly improve performance, achieving up to 79.27% success in one-shot generation compared to 22.44% for Codex and 31.1% for Copilot in default settings. Actioning this potential in practice is challenging due to the complex interplay in our study - the optimal settings for temperature, prompt, and number of generated solutions vary by problem. Reproducing our study with StarCoder2 confirms these findings, indicating they are not model-specific. We also uncover surprising behaviors (e.g., fully removing the prompt can be effective), revealing model brittleness and areas for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 3 Figures (not counted the subfigures), 16 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Selection of Protections to Mitigate Risks Against Software Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18470v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach for the automated selection of software protections to mitigate MATE risks against critical assets within software applications. We formalize the key elements involved in protection decision-making - including code artifacts, assets, security requirements, attacks, and software protections - and frame the protection process through a game-theoretic model. In this model, a defender strategically applies protections to various code artifacts of a target application, anticipating repeated attack attempts by adversaries against the confidentiality and integrity of the application's assets. The selection of the optimal defense maximizes resistance to attacks while ensuring the application remains usable by constraining the overhead introduced by protections. The game is solved through a heuristic based on a mini-max depth-first exploration strategy, augmented with dynamic programming optimizations for improved efficiency. Central to our formulation is the introduction of the Software Protection Index, an original contribution that extends existing notions of potency and resilience by evaluating protection effectiveness against attack paths using software metrics and expert assessments. We validate our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation and expert evaluations, demonstrating that automated software protection is a practical and effective solution for risk mitigation in software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

These errors frequently serve as vectors for severe vulnerabilities, while their repair requires extensive knowledge of program logic and C's memory model. Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a critical research area to address these challenges. Traditional APR approaches rely on expert-designed strategies and predefined templates, which are labor-intensive and constrained by the effectiveness of manual specifications. Deep learning techniques offer a promising alternative by automatically extracting repair patterns, but they require substantial training datasets and often lack interpretability. This paper introduces LTFix, a novel approach that harnesses the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated memory error repair, especially for complex repository-level errors that span multiple functions and files. We address two fundamental challenges in LLM-based memory error repair: a limited understanding of interprocedural memory management patterns and context window limitations for repository-wide analysis. Our approach utilizes a finite typestate automaton to guide the tracking of error-propagation paths and context trace, capturing both spatial (memory states) and temporal (execution history) dimensions of error behavior. This typestate-guided context retrieval strategy provides the LLM with concise yet semantically rich information relevant to erroneous memory management, effectively addressing the token limitation of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Analytics for Collaborators Answers, Code Quality, and Dropout on Stack Overflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18329v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies that used data from Stack Overflow to develop predictive models often employed limited benchmarks of 3-5 models or adopted arbitrary selection methods. Despite being insightful, their limited scope suggests the need to benchmark more models to avoid overlooking untested algorithms. Our study evaluates 21 algorithms across three tasks: predicting the number of question a user is likely to answer, their code quality violations, and their dropout status. We employed normalisation, standardisation, as well as logarithmic and power transformations paired with Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation and genetic algorithms. CodeBERT, a pre-trained language model for both natural and programming languages, was fine-tuned to classify user dropout given their posts (questions and answers) and code snippets. We found Bagging ensemble models combined with standardisation achieved the highest R2 value (0.821) in predicting user answers. The Stochastic Gradient Descent regressor, followed by Bagging and Epsilon Support Vector Machine models, consistently demonstrated superior performance to other benchmarked algorithms in predicting user code quality across multiple quality dimensions and languages. Extreme Gradient Boosting paired with log-transformation exhibited the highest F1-score (0.825) in predicting user dropout. CodeBERT was able to classify user dropout with a final F1-score of 0.809, validating the performance of Extreme Gradient Boosting that was solely based on numerical data. Overall, our benchmarking of 21 algorithms provides multiple insights. Researchers can leverage findings regarding the most suitable models for specific target variables, and practitioners can utilise the identified optimal hyperparameters to reduce the initial search space during their own hyperparameter tuning processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 17 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Use Property-Based Testing to Bridge LLM Code Generation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18315v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their outputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is a persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers a path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the scarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test generation, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can misdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated Solver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to validate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on specific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define and verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the "cycle of self-deception" where tests might share flaws with the code they are meant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative LLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative refinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate semantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting comprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its refinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within this iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a robust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code. Extensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks demonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1 improvements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLAZE: Cross-Language and Cross-Project Bug Localization via Dynamic Chunking and Hard Example Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17631v3)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bugs require developers to exert significant effort to identify and resolve them, often consuming about one-third of their time. Bug localization, the process of pinpointing the exact source code files that need modification, is crucial in reducing this effort. Existing bug localization tools, typically reliant on deep learning techniques, face limitations in cross-project applicability and effectiveness in multi-language environments. Recent advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) offer detailed representations for bug localization. However, they encounter challenges with limited context windows and mapping accuracy. To address these issues, we propose BLAZE, an approach that employs dynamic chunking and hard example learning. First, BLAZE dynamically segments source code to minimize continuity loss. Then, BLAZE fine-tunes a GPT-based model using challenging bug cases, in order to enhance cross-project and cross-language bug localization. To support the capability of BLAZE, we create the BEETLEBOX dataset, which comprises 26,321 bugs from 29 large and thriving open-source projects across five different programming languages (Java, C++, Python, Go, and JavaScript). Our evaluations of BLAZE on three benchmark datasets BEETLEBOX, SWE-Bench, and Ye et al. demonstrate substantial improvements compared to six state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, BLAZE achieves up to an increase of 120% in Top 1 accuracy, 144% in Mean Average Precision (MAP), and 100% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). An extensive ablation study confirms the contributions of our pipeline components to the overall performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Call Me Maybe: Enhancing JavaScript Call Graph Construction using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18191v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues. A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features, existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges (150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases, reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.</p></details> |  |

While code generation using LLMs has become a popular field of research, code evaluation using LLMs remains under-explored. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We propose multi-agentic novel approaches using \emph{question-specific rubrics} tailored to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical assessment than the existing approaches that use \emph{question-agnostic rubrics}. To address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics (Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that \emph{question-specific rubrics} significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond mere syntactic correctness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICER 2025</p></details> |

However, they can generate inaccurate patches. Little is known about the root causes behind those failed patches or how those could be fixed. This paper reports an empirical study of the failed patches generated by seven top LLM code agents. We collected 114 issues from the SWE-bench Lite dataset that remained unresolved across the agents. The seven agents produced a total of 769 failed patches for those issues, which we checked with a combination of GPT-4o and manual analysis. We present a taxonomy of the failure reasons across the patches. The taxonomy contains six categories, with several sub-categories under each category. For example, a frequently observed category is the inability of an LLM to correctly infer/produce the appropriate variable type in the produced patch. As a first step towards addressing such type-related errors, we designed PAGENT (Patch Agent). PAGENT utilizes program analysis techniques like CFG creation and exploration to infer the type of information of a patch. PAGENT does this by applying repository-level static code analysis techniques. Then, PAGENT refines the inferred type by further utilizing an LLM-based inference technique. We tested PAGENT on all 127 type-related failed patches from the top three agents in our study. PAGENT could fix 29 of the 127 failed patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Compiler Bug Isolation by Leveraging Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17647v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compilers play a foundational role in building reliable software systems, and bugs within them can lead to catastrophic consequences. The compilation process typically involves hundreds of files, making traditional automated bug isolation techniques inapplicable due to scalability or effectiveness issues. Current mainstream compiler bug localization techniques have limitations in test program mutation and resource consumption. Inspired by the recent advances of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose an innovative approach named AutoCBI, which (1) uses LLMs to summarize compiler file functions and (2) employs specialized prompts to guide LLM in reordering suspicious file rankings. This approach leverages four types of information: the failing test program, source file function summaries, lists of suspicious files identified through analyzing test coverage, as well as compilation configurations with related output messages, resulting in a refined ranking of suspicious files. Our evaluation of AutoCBI against state-of-the-art approaches (DiWi, RecBi and FuseFL) on 120 real-world bugs from the widely-used GCC and LLVM compilers demonstrates its effectiveness. Specifically, AutoCBI isolates 66.67%/69.23%, 300%/340%, and 100%/57.14% more bugs than RecBi, DiWi, and FuseFL, respectively, in the Top-1 ranked results for GCC/LLVM. Additionally, the ablation study underscores the significance of each component in our approach.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[CodeMorph: Mitigating Data Leakage in Large Language Model Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17627v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concerns about benchmark leakage in large language models for code (Code LLMs) have raised issues of data contamination and inflated evaluation metrics. The diversity and inaccessibility of many training datasets make it difficult to prevent data leakage entirely, even with time lag strategies. Consequently, generating new datasets through code perturbation has become essential. However, existing methods often fail to produce complex and diverse variations, struggle with complex cross-file dependencies, and lack support for multiple programming languages, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing LLM evaluations for coding tasks. To fill this gap, we propose CodeMorph, an approach designed to support multiple programming languages while preserving cross-file dependencies to mitigate data leakage. CodeMorph consists of two main components that work together to enhance the perturbation process. The first component employs 26 semantic-preserving transformation methods to iteratively perturb code, generating diverse variations while ensuring that the modified code remains compilable. The second component introduces a genetic algorithm-based selection algorithm, PESO, to identify the more effective perturbation method for each iteration by targeting lower similarity scores between the perturbed and original code, thereby enhancing overall perturbation effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that after applying CodeMorph, the accuracy of the LLM on code completion tasks across five programming languages decreased by an average of 24.67%, with Python showing the most significant reduction at 45%. The similarity score of code optimized by PESO is, on average, 7.01% lower than that of randomly perturbed code, peaking at a reduction of 42.86%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2025 (Industry Challenge Track)</p></details> |
| **[Fuzzing-based Mutation Testing of C/C++ CPS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24100v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mutation testing can help minimize the delivery of faulty software. Therefore, it is a recommended practice for developing embedded software in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, state-of-the-art mutation testing techniques for C and C++ software, which are common languages for CPS, depend on symbolic execution. Unfortunately, symbolic execution's limitations hinder its applicability (e.g., systems with black-box components). We propose relying on fuzz testing, which has demonstrated its effectiveness for C and C++ software. Fuzz testing tools automatically create test inputs that explore program branches in various ways, exercising statements in different program states, and thus enabling the detection of mutants, which is our objective. We empirically evaluated our approach using software components from operational satellite systems. Our assessment shows that our approach can detect between 40% and 90% of the mutants not detected by developers' test suites. Further, we empirically determined that the best results are obtained by integrating the Clang compiler, a memory address sanitizer, and relying on laf-intel instrumentation to collect coverage and guide fuzzing. Our approach detects a significantly higher percentage of live mutants compared to symbolic execution, with an increase of up to 50 percentage points; further, we observed that although the combination of fuzzing and symbolic execution leads to additional mutants being killed, the benefits are minimal (a gain of less than one percentage point).</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |

Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.</p></details> | 63 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Behavior Driven Development for 3D Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17057v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer 3D games are complex software environments that require novel testing processes to ensure high-quality standards. The Intelligent Verification/Validation for Extended Reality Based Systems (iv4XR) framework addresses this need by enabling the implementation of autonomous agents to automate game testing scenarios. This framework facilitates the automation of regression test cases for complex 3D games like Space Engineers. Nevertheless, the technical expertise required to define test scripts using iv4XR can constrain seamless collaboration between developers and testers. This paper reports how integrating a Behavior-driven Development (BDD) approach with the iv4XR framework allows the industrial company behind Space Engineers to automate regression testing. The success of this industrial collaboration has inspired the iv4XR team to integrate the BDD approach to improve the automation of play-testing for the experimental 3D game LabRecruits. Furthermore, the iv4XR framework has been extended with tactical programming to enable the automation of long-play test scenarios in Space Engineers. These results underscore the versatility of the iv4XR framework in supporting diverse testing approaches while showcasing how BDD empowers users to create, manage, and execute automated game tests using comprehensive and human-readable statements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PinChecker: Identifying Unsound Safe Abstractions of Rust Pinning APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14500v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pinning APIs of Rust language guarantee memory location stability for self-referential and asynchronous constructs, as long as used according to the pinning API contract. Rust ensures violations of such contract are impossible in regular safe code, but not in unsafe code where unsafe pinning APIs can be used. Library authors can encapsulate arbitrary unsafe code within regular library functions. These can be freely called in higher-level code without explicit warnings. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze library functions to rule out pinning API contract violations. Unfortunately, such testing relies on manual analysis by library authors, which is ineffective. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, given a library, attempts to construct programs that intentionally breach the pinning API contract by chaining library function calls, thereby verifying their soundness. We introduce RPIL, a novel intermediate representation that models functions' critical behaviors pertaining to pinning APIs. We implement PinChecker, a synthesis-driven violation detection tool guided by RPIL, which automatically synthesizes bug-revealing programs. Our experiments on 13 popular Rust libraries from crates.io found 2 confirmed bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |
| **[AlphaTrans: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Approach for Repository-Level Code Translation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Thermal Modeling and Optimal Allocation of Avionics Safety-critical Tasks on Heterogeneous MPSoCs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22214v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoC) can deliver high performance needed in many industrial domains, including aerospace. However, their high power consumption, combined with avionics safety standards, brings new thermal management challenges. This paper investigates techniques for offline thermal-aware allocation of periodic tasks on heterogeneous MPSoCs running at a fixed clock frequency, as required in avionics. The goal is to find the assignment of tasks to (i) cores and (ii) temporal isolation windows while minimizing the MPSoC temperature. To achieve that, we propose and analyze three power models, and integrate them within several novel optimization approaches based on heuristics, a black-box optimizer, and Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We perform the experimental evaluation on three popular MPSoC platforms (NXP i.MX8QM MEK, NXP i.MX8QM Ixora, NVIDIA TX2) and observe a difference of up to 5.5{\deg}C among the tested methods (corresponding to a 22% reduction w.r.t. the ambient temperature). We also show that our method, integrating the empirical power model with the ILP, outperforms the other methods on all tested platforms.</p></details> | Accepted version |
| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing is Fixing: Cross-Modal Reasoning with Multimodal LLMs for Visual Software Issue Fixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16136v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-(LLM) based automated program repair (APR) techniques have shown promising results in resolving real-world GitHub issue tasks. Existing APR systems are primarily evaluated in unimodal settings (e.g., SWE-bench). However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal problem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and leveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on visual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and generate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal reasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding and capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key components, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch validation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue report, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code responsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into executable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the visual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of the patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue, providing feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M, and the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o as the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best open-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the base model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances, outperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on incorporating cross-modal reasoning by understanding and capturing visual information to resolve multimodal issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExploraCoder: Advancing code generation for multiple unseen APIs via planning and chained exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05366v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models face intrinsic limitations in coding with APIs that are unseen in their training corpora. As libraries continuously evolve, it becomes impractical to exhaustively retrain LLMs with new API knowledge. This limitation hampers LLMs from solving programming problems which require newly introduced or privately maintained libraries. Inspired by exploratory programming paradigm in human behavior, we propose ExploraCoder, a training-free framework that empowers LLMs to invoke multiple unseen APIs in code solution by (1) planning a complex problem into several API invocation subtasks, and (2) experimenting with correct API usage at intermediate steps through a novel chain-of-API-exploration. We conduct evaluation on program synthesizing tasks involving complex API interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that ExploraCoder significantly improves performance for models lacking prior API knowledge, achieving absolute increases of up to 11.99% over retrieval-based approaches and 17.28% over pretraining-based methods in pass@10.</p></details> |  |

In Phase 1, students used LCAs to generate code from abstract specifications (From-Scratch approach), achieving only 20% MVP completion. In Phase 2, students adapted existing Minimal Functional Units (MFUs), small, functional code examples, using LCAs, achieving 100% MVP completion. Analysis revealed that the MFU-based approach succeeded by aligning with LCA strengths in pattern modification rather than de novo generation, while providing cognitive scaffolds that enabled students to navigate complex development tasks. The study introduces a dual-scaffolding model combining technical support (MFUs) with pedagogical guidance (structured prompting strategies), demonstrating that effective LCA integration depends less on AI capabilities than on instructional design. These findings offer practical guidance for educators seeking to transform AI tools from sources of frustration into productive learning partners in programming education.</p></details> |  |

As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5 encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3, Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the CodeT5-Authorship architecture, the LLM-AuthorBench benchmark, and all relevant Google Colab scripts on GitHub: https://github.com/LLMauthorbench/.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained, semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation. Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.</p></details> |  |

This challenge becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library. Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates 1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.</p></details> | 29 pages |

Traditional ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption. [Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns, aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity, though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to adopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated approach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while aligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 51st Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA) 2025</p></details> |

LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Existing LLM serving systems employs Continuous Batching for throughput improvement. However, they rely on static batch size configurations that cannot adapt to fluctuating request rates or heterogeneous workloads, leading to frequent SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations and unstable performance. In this study, We propose SABER, a dynamic batching strategy that predicts per-request SLA feasibility and adjusts decisions in real time. SABER improves goodput by up to 26% over the best static configurations and reduces latency variability by up to 45%, all without manual tuning or service restarts. Our results demonstrate that SLA-aware, adaptive scheduling is key to robust, high-performance CodeLLM serving.</p></details> |  |

However, code-comment inconsistency (CCI) can negatively affect software development, testing, and maintenance. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue have emerged, but existing studies often suffer from inaccurate datasets and inadequate solutions, weakening their practical effectiveness. In this study, we first conduct a quantitative analysis of existing datasets, revealing a substantial portion of sampled data are mislabeled. To address these data limitations, we introduce CCIBench, a refined dataset comprising high-quality data, to support the training and evaluation of method-level CCI methods. Furthermore, we present an innovative end-to-end LLM-based framework, CCISolver, designed to improve code quality by identifying and rectifying CCIs. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate CCISolver's superior performance. For detection, it establishes a new state-of-the-art with an F1-score of 89.54%. In fixing task, it achieves a remarkable 18.84% relative improvement in GLEU score over the strongest baseline. This superiority is confirmed by human evaluation, where CCISolver's fixing success rate of 0.6533 significantly surpasses existing methods. Critically, in a practical end-to-end setting, CCISolver's innovative architecture is approximately 36% faster for inference than the baseline model, underscoring its scalability and real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review</p></details> |

The developed system integrates LLMs such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama, with Revit software to interpret building codes, generate Python scripts, and perform semi-automated compliance checks within the BIM environment. Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions, material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and cost-effective solution, this proposed approach offers a promising advancement in BIM-based compliance checking, with potential applications across diverse regulatory documents in construction projects.</p></details> |  |

This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ReCode.</p></details> | Work in progress |

HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6\% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9\% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of machine learning models in this domain is often hindered by low-quality training datasets, which contain noisy, mislabeled, or imbalanced samples. This paper proposes a novel dataset maps-empowered approach that systematically identifies and mitigates hard-to-learn outliers, referred to as "bad seeds", to improve model training efficiency. Our approach can categorize training examples based on learning difficulty and integrate this information into an active learning framework. Unlike traditional methods that focus on uncertainty-based sampling, our strategy prioritizes dataset quality by filtering out performance-harmful samples while emphasizing informative ones. Our experimental results show that our approach can improve F1 score over random selection by 45.36% (DeepGini) and 45.91% (K-Means) and outperforms standard active learning by 61.46% (DeepGini) and 32.65% (K-Means) for CodeBERT on the Big-Vul dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating dataset maps for optimizing sample selection in vulnerability detection. Furthermore, our approach also enhances model robustness, improves sample selection by filtering bad seeds, and stabilizes active learning performance across iterations. By analyzing the characteristics of these outliers, we provide insights for future improvements in dataset construction, making vulnerability detection more reliable and cost-effective.</p></details> |  |

This systematic literature review investigates DT composition and verification and validation (V&V) methodologies. Analyzing 21 studies from 2022-2024, we examined composition mechanisms, SoS characteristics, and V&V formality, scope, and challenges. While composition is discussed, formalization is limited. V&V approaches vary, with semi-formal methods and simulations dominating; formal verification is underutilized. Key technical challenges include model uncertainty and integration complexity. Methodological challenges highlight the lack of standardized DT-specific V&V frameworks. There is a need to move beyond model validation to address integration and cyber-physical consistency. This review contributes a structured classification of V&V approaches and emphasizes the need for standardized, scalable V&V and rigorous composition methodologies for complex DT implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, Presented at the 23rd Overture workshop, June 2025 (arXiv:cs/2506.08680)</p></details> |
| **[VulStamp: Vulnerability Assessment using Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11484v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern vulnerability detection tools enable developers to efficiently identify numerous security flaws, indiscriminate remediation efforts often lead to superfluous development expenses. This is particularly true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency. Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types, VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to train the assessment model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifting the Veil on Composition, Risks, and Mitigations of the Large Language Model Supply Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21218v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have sparked significant impact with regard to both intelligence and productivity. Numerous enterprises have integrated LLMs into their applications to solve their own domain-specific tasks. However, integrating LLMs into specific scenarios is a systematic process that involves substantial components, which are collectively referred to as the LLM supply chain. A comprehensive understanding of LLM supply chain composition, as well as the relationships among its components, is crucial for enabling effective mitigation measures for different related risks. While existing literature has explored various risks associated with LLMs, there remains a notable gap in systematically characterizing the LLM supply chain from the dual perspectives of contributors and consumers. In this work, we develop a structured taxonomy encompassing risk types, risky actions, and corresponding mitigations across different stakeholders and components of the supply chain. We believe that a thorough review of the LLM supply chain composition, along with its inherent risks and mitigation measures, would be valuable for industry practitioners to avoid potential damages and losses, and enlightening for academic researchers to rethink existing approaches and explore new avenues of research.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Objective: Our objective is to evaluate how SRs report research artifacts and to provide a comprehensive list of these artifacts. Method: We examined 537 secondary studies published between 2013 and 2023 to analyze the availability and reporting of research artifacts. Results: Our findings indicate that only 31.5% of the reviewed studies include research artifacts. Encouragingly, the situation is gradually improving, as our regression analysis shows a significant increase in the availability of research artifacts over time. However, in 2023, just 62.0% of secondary studies provide a research artifact while an even lower percentage, 30.4% use a permanent repository with a digital object identifier (DOI) for storage. Conclusion: To enhance transparency and reproducibility in SE research, we advocate for the mandatory publication of research artifacts in secondary studies.</p></details> |  |

LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

However, code-comment inconsistency (CCI) can negatively affect software development, testing, and maintenance. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue have emerged, but existing studies often suffer from inaccurate datasets and inadequate solutions, weakening their practical effectiveness. In this study, we first conduct a quantitative analysis of existing datasets, revealing a substantial portion of sampled data are mislabeled. To address these data limitations, we introduce CCIBench, a refined dataset comprising high-quality data, to support the training and evaluation of method-level CCI methods. Furthermore, we present an innovative end-to-end LLM-based framework, CCISolver, designed to improve code quality by identifying and rectifying CCIs. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate CCISolver's superior performance. For detection, it establishes a new state-of-the-art with an F1-score of 89.54%. In fixing task, it achieves a remarkable 18.84% relative improvement in GLEU score over the strongest baseline. This superiority is confirmed by human evaluation, where CCISolver's fixing success rate of 0.6533 significantly surpasses existing methods. Critically, in a practical end-to-end setting, CCISolver's innovative architecture is approximately 36% faster for inference than the baseline model, underscoring its scalability and real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review</p></details> |

The developed system integrates LLMs such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama, with Revit software to interpret building codes, generate Python scripts, and perform semi-automated compliance checks within the BIM environment. Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions, material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and cost-effective solution, this proposed approach offers a promising advancement in BIM-based compliance checking, with potential applications across diverse regulatory documents in construction projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Attribution for Large Language Models: A Distribution Testing Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20197v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs). We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees. Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the LLM, a form of access commonly available. We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores ( $\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Can Language Models Replace Programmers for Coding? REPOCOD Says 'Not Yet'](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21647v4)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a number of repository-level code generation benchmarks-such as CoderEval, DevEval, RepoEval, RepoBench, and LongCodeArena-have emerged to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond standalone benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. Thus, a natural question is, would LLMs have similar performance in real world coding tasks as their performance in these benchmarks? Unfortunately, one cannot answer this question, since these benchmarks consist of short completions, synthetic examples, or focus on limited scale repositories, failing to represent real-world coding tasks. To address these challenges, we create REPOCOD, a Python code-generation benchmark containing complex tasks with realistic dependencies in real-world large projects and appropriate metrics for evaluating source code. It includes 980 whole-function generation tasks from 11 popular projects, 50.8% of which require repository-level context. REPOCOD includes 314 developer-written test cases per instance for better evaluation. We evaluate ten LLMs on REPOCOD and find that none achieves more than 30% pass@1 on REPOCOD, indicating the necessity of building stronger LLMs that can help developers in real-world software development. In addition, we found that retrieval-augmented generation achieves better results than using target function dependencies as context.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating source code, two major challenges persist in UI-to-HTML code generation: (1) effectively representing HTML's hierarchical structure for LLMs, and (2) bridging the gap between the visual nature of UI designs and the text-based format of HTML code. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Waffle, a new fine-tuning strategy that uses a structure-aware attention mechanism to improve LLMs' understanding of HTML's structure and a contrastive fine-tuning approach to align LLMs' understanding of UI images and HTML code. Models fine-tuned with Waffle show up to 9.00 pp (percentage point) higher HTML match, 0.0982 higher CW-SSIM, 32.99 higher CLIP, and 27.12 pp higher LLEM on our new benchmark WebSight-Test and an existing benchmark Design2Code, outperforming current fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Replace Humans During Code Chunking?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19897v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science, especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However, existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided modernization.</p></details> |  |

Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |

We present a multicore SystemC-TLM-based CPU model that can be used as a drop-in replacement for an instruction-set simulator. It places no special requirements on the host system, making it compatible with various environments. Benchmark results show that our ARM-on-ARM-based virtual platform achieves up to 10 x speedup over traditional instruction-set-simulator-based models on compute-intensive workloads. Depending on the benchmark, speedups increase to more than 100 x.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference 2025 (DATE '25)</p></details> |
| **[Generating and Understanding Tests via Path-Aware Symbolic Execution with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19287v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering systematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code including library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead constructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the first to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are actually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and visualization of their path profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynNPC: Finding More Violations Induced by ADS in Simulation Testing through Dynamic NPC Behavior Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19567v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a number of simulation testing approaches have been proposed to generate diverse driving scenarios for autonomous driving systems (ADSs) testing. However, the behaviors of NPC vehicles in these scenarios generated by previous approaches are predefined and mutated before simulation execution, ignoring traffic signals and the behaviors of the Ego vehicle. Thus, a large number of the violations they found are induced by unrealistic behaviors of NPC vehicles, revealing no bugs of ADSs. Besides, the vast scenario search space of NPC behaviors during the iterative mutations limits the efficiency of previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a novel scenario-based testing framework, DynNPC, to generate more violation scenarios induced by the ADS. Specifically, DynNPC allows NPC vehicles to dynamically generate behaviors using different driving strategies during simulation execution based on traffic signals and the real-time behavior of the Ego vehicle. We compare DynNPC with five state-of-the-art scenario-based testing approaches. Our evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of DynNPC in finding more violation scenarios induced by the ADS.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroupTuner: Efficient Group-Aware Compiler Auto-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08598v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern compilers typically provide hundreds of options to optimize program performance, but users often cannot fully leverage them due to the huge number of options. While standard optimization combinations (e.g., -O3) provide reasonable defaults, they often fail to deliver near-peak performance across diverse programs and architectures. To address this challenge, compiler auto-tuning techniques have emerged to automate the discovery of improved option combinations. Existing techniques typically focus on identifying critical options and prioritizing them during the search to improve efficiency. However, due to limited tuning iterations, the resulting data is often sparse and noisy, making it highly challenging to accurately identify critical options. As a result, these algorithms are prone to being trapped in local optima. To address this limitation, we propose GroupTuner, a group-aware auto-tuning technique that directly applies localized mutation to coherent option groups based on historically best-performing combinations, thus avoiding explicitly identifying critical options. By forgoing the need to know precisely which options are most important, GroupTuner maximizes the use of existing performance data, ensuring more targeted exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTuner can efficiently discover competitive option combinations, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.39% over -O3 while requiring only 77.21% of the time compared to the random search algorithm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in the ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES'25), June 16-17, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea</p></details> |

However, automating these interactive features for testing is fraught with challenges, owing to their inherent need for timely, dynamic, and collaborative user interactions, which current automated testing methods inadequately address. Inspired by the concept of agents designed to autonomously and collaboratively tackle problems, we propose MAdroid, a novel multi-agent approach powered by the Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the multi-user interactive task for app feature testing. Specifically, MAdroid employs two functional types of multi-agents: user agents (Operator) and supervisor agents (Coordinator and Observer). Each agent takes a specific role: the Coordinator directs the interactive task; the Operator mimics user interactions on the device; and the Observer monitors and reviews the task automation process. Our evaluation, which included 41 multi-user interactive tasks, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 82.9% of the tasks with 96.8% action similarity, outperforming the ablation studies and state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a preliminary investigation underscores MAdroid's practicality by helping identify 11 multi-user interactive bugs during regression app testing, confirming its potential value in real-world software development contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2504.15474</p></details> |

Existing LLM serving systems employs Continuous Batching for throughput improvement. However, they rely on static batch size configurations that cannot adapt to fluctuating request rates or heterogeneous workloads, leading to frequent SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations and unstable performance. In this study, We propose SABER, a dynamic batching strategy that predicts per-request SLA feasibility and adjusts decisions in real time. SABER improves goodput by up to 26% over the best static configurations and reduces latency variability by up to 45%, all without manual tuning or service restarts. Our results demonstrate that SLA-aware, adaptive scheduling is key to robust, high-performance CodeLLM serving.</p></details> |  |

Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions, material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and cost-effective solution, this proposed approach offers a promising advancement in BIM-based compliance checking, with potential applications across diverse regulatory documents in construction projects.</p></details> |  |

This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6\% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9\% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This is particularly true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency. Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types, VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to train the assessment model.</p></details> |  |

Numerous enterprises have integrated LLMs into their applications to solve their own domain-specific tasks. However, integrating LLMs into specific scenarios is a systematic process that involves substantial components, which are collectively referred to as the LLM supply chain. A comprehensive understanding of LLM supply chain composition, as well as the relationships among its components, is crucial for enabling effective mitigation measures for different related risks. While existing literature has explored various risks associated with LLMs, there remains a notable gap in systematically characterizing the LLM supply chain from the dual perspectives of contributors and consumers. In this work, we develop a structured taxonomy encompassing risk types, risky actions, and corresponding mitigations across different stakeholders and components of the supply chain. We believe that a thorough review of the LLM supply chain composition, along with its inherent risks and mitigation measures, would be valuable for industry practitioners to avoid potential damages and losses, and enlightening for academic researchers to rethink existing approaches and explore new avenues of research.</p></details> | 26 pages |

We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees. Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the LLM, a form of access commonly available. We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores ( $\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack). We introduce QHackBench, a novel benchmark dataset derived from QHack competitions, and evaluate model performance under vanilla prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our structured evaluation framework assesses functional correctness, syntactic validity, and execution success across varying challenge difficulties. Results indicate that RAG-enhanced models, supplemented with an augmented PennyLane dataset, approximately generate similar results as the standard prompting, particularly in complex quantum algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that iteratively refines incorrect solutions, further enhancing execution success rates. To foster further research, we commit to publicly releasing QHackBench, along with our evaluation framework and experimental results, enabling continued advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, submitted to QAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can Language Models Replace Programmers for Coding? REPOCOD Says 'Not Yet'](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21647v4)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a number of repository-level code generation benchmarks-such as CoderEval, DevEval, RepoEval, RepoBench, and LongCodeArena-have emerged to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond standalone benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. Thus, a natural question is, would LLMs have similar performance in real world coding tasks as their performance in these benchmarks? Unfortunately, one cannot answer this question, since these benchmarks consist of short completions, synthetic examples, or focus on limited scale repositories, failing to represent real-world coding tasks. To address these challenges, we create REPOCOD, a Python code-generation benchmark containing complex tasks with realistic dependencies in real-world large projects and appropriate metrics for evaluating source code. It includes 980 whole-function generation tasks from 11 popular projects, 50.8% of which require repository-level context. REPOCOD includes 314 developer-written test cases per instance for better evaluation. We evaluate ten LLMs on REPOCOD and find that none achieves more than 30% pass@1 on REPOCOD, indicating the necessity of building stronger LLMs that can help developers in real-world software development. In addition, we found that retrieval-augmented generation achieves better results than using target function dependencies as context.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating source code, two major challenges persist in UI-to-HTML code generation: (1) effectively representing HTML's hierarchical structure for LLMs, and (2) bridging the gap between the visual nature of UI designs and the text-based format of HTML code. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Waffle, a new fine-tuning strategy that uses a structure-aware attention mechanism to improve LLMs' understanding of HTML's structure and a contrastive fine-tuning approach to align LLMs' understanding of UI images and HTML code. Models fine-tuned with Waffle show up to 9.00 pp (percentage point) higher HTML match, 0.0982 higher CW-SSIM, 32.99 higher CLIP, and 27.12 pp higher LLEM on our new benchmark WebSight-Test and an existing benchmark Design2Code, outperforming current fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Existing LLM serving systems employs Continuous Batching for throughput improvement. However, they rely on static batch size configurations that cannot adapt to fluctuating request rates or heterogeneous workloads, leading to frequent SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations and unstable performance. In this study, We propose SABER, a dynamic batching strategy that predicts per-request SLA feasibility and adjusts decisions in real time. SABER improves goodput by up to 26% over the best static configurations and reduces latency variability by up to 45%, all without manual tuning or service restarts. Our results demonstrate that SLA-aware, adaptive scheduling is key to robust, high-performance CodeLLM serving.</p></details> |  |

However, code-comment inconsistency (CCI) can negatively affect software development, testing, and maintenance. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue have emerged, but existing studies often suffer from inaccurate datasets and inadequate solutions, weakening their practical effectiveness. In this study, we first conduct a quantitative analysis of existing datasets, revealing a substantial portion of sampled data are mislabeled. To address these data limitations, we introduce CCIBench, a refined dataset comprising high-quality data, to support the training and evaluation of method-level CCI methods. Furthermore, we present an innovative end-to-end LLM-based framework, CCISolver, designed to improve code quality by identifying and rectifying CCIs. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate CCISolver's superior performance. For detection, it establishes a new state-of-the-art with an F1-score of 89.54%. In fixing task, it achieves a remarkable 18.84% relative improvement in GLEU score over the strongest baseline. This superiority is confirmed by human evaluation, where CCISolver's fixing success rate of 0.6533 significantly surpasses existing methods. Critically, in a practical end-to-end setting, CCISolver's innovative architecture is approximately 36% faster for inference than the baseline model, underscoring its scalability and real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of machine learning models in this domain is often hindered by low-quality training datasets, which contain noisy, mislabeled, or imbalanced samples. This paper proposes a novel dataset maps-empowered approach that systematically identifies and mitigates hard-to-learn outliers, referred to as "bad seeds", to improve model training efficiency. Our approach can categorize training examples based on learning difficulty and integrate this information into an active learning framework. Unlike traditional methods that focus on uncertainty-based sampling, our strategy prioritizes dataset quality by filtering out performance-harmful samples while emphasizing informative ones. Our experimental results show that our approach can improve F1 score over random selection by 45.36% (DeepGini) and 45.91% (K-Means) and outperforms standard active learning by 61.46% (DeepGini) and 32.65% (K-Means) for CodeBERT on the Big-Vul dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating dataset maps for optimizing sample selection in vulnerability detection. Furthermore, our approach also enhances model robustness, improves sample selection by filtering bad seeds, and stabilizes active learning performance across iterations. By analyzing the characteristics of these outliers, we provide insights for future improvements in dataset construction, making vulnerability detection more reliable and cost-effective.</p></details> |  |

Objective: Our objective is to evaluate how SRs report research artifacts and to provide a comprehensive list of these artifacts. Method: We examined 537 secondary studies published between 2013 and 2023 to analyze the availability and reporting of research artifacts. Results: Our findings indicate that only 31.5% of the reviewed studies include research artifacts. Encouragingly, the situation is gradually improving, as our regression analysis shows a significant increase in the availability of research artifacts over time. However, in 2023, just 62.0% of secondary studies provide a research artifact while an even lower percentage, 30.4% use a permanent repository with a digital object identifier (DOI) for storage.

Domain experts (DEs) from different disciplines collaborate with professional software developers (SDEs), bringing complementary expertise in creating and maintaining complex production software. However, contested expectations, divergent problem-solving perspectives, and conflicting priorities lead to friction. Aims: This study aims to investigate the dynamics of emerging collaboration of cross-disciplinary software development (CDSD) by exploring the expectations held by DEs and SDEs and understanding how these frictions manifest in practice. Method: We utilize Activity Theory (AT), a well-established socio-technical framework, as an analytical lens in a grounded, empirical investigation, conducted through a mixed-method study involving 24 interviews (12 DEs and 12 SDEs) and a large-scale validation survey with 293 participants (161 DEs and 132 SDEs). Results: We conceptualize and empirically ground the CDSD dynamics. We identified eight expectations held by SDEs and six by DEs. By mapping these expectations to AT components, we revealed 21 frictions in CDSD and illustrated where and how they arise. Conclusions: This study offers a theoretical lens for understanding the dynamics and frictions in CDSD and provides actionable insights for future research, practitioners, and infrastructure design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Cross...</summary><p>Cross-disciplinary Collaboration, Activity Theory, Mixed-Methods</p></details> |

This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack). We introduce QHackBench, a novel benchmark dataset derived from QHack competitions, and evaluate model performance under vanilla prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our structured evaluation framework assesses functional correctness, syntactic validity, and execution success across varying challenge difficulties. Results indicate that RAG-enhanced models, supplemented with an augmented PennyLane dataset, approximately generate similar results as the standard prompting, particularly in complex quantum algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that iteratively refines incorrect solutions, further enhancing execution success rates. To foster further research, we commit to publicly releasing QHackBench, along with our evaluation framework and experimental results, enabling continued advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, submitted to QAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can Language Models Replace Programmers for Coding? REPOCOD Says 'Not Yet'](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21647v4)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a number of repository-level code generation benchmarks-such as CoderEval, DevEval, RepoEval, RepoBench, and LongCodeArena-have emerged to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond standalone benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. Thus, a natural question is, would LLMs have similar performance in real world coding tasks as their performance in these benchmarks? Unfortunately, one cannot answer this question, since these benchmarks consist of short completions, synthetic examples, or focus on limited scale repositories, failing to represent real-world coding tasks. To address these challenges, we create REPOCOD, a Python code-generation benchmark containing complex tasks with realistic dependencies in real-world large projects and appropriate metrics for evaluating source code. It includes 980 whole-function generation tasks from 11 popular projects, 50.8% of which require repository-level context. REPOCOD includes 314 developer-written test cases per instance for better evaluation. We evaluate ten LLMs on REPOCOD and find that none achieves more than 30% pass@1 on REPOCOD, indicating the necessity of building stronger LLMs that can help developers in real-world software development. In addition, we found that retrieval-augmented generation achieves better results than using target function dependencies as context.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating source code, two major challenges persist in UI-to-HTML code generation: (1) effectively representing HTML's hierarchical structure for LLMs, and (2) bridging the gap between the visual nature of UI designs and the text-based format of HTML code. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Waffle, a new fine-tuning strategy that uses a structure-aware attention mechanism to improve LLMs' understanding of HTML's structure and a contrastive fine-tuning approach to align LLMs' understanding of UI images and HTML code. Models fine-tuned with Waffle show up to 9.00 pp (percentage point) higher HTML match, 0.0982 higher CW-SSIM, 32.99 higher CLIP, and 27.12 pp higher LLEM on our new benchmark WebSight-Test and an existing benchmark Design2Code, outperforming current fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Investigation on the Challenges in Scientific Workflow Systems Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10890v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific Workflow Systems (SWSs) are advanced software frameworks that drive modern research by orchestrating complex computational tasks and managing extensive data pipelines. These systems offer a range of essential features, including modularity, abstraction, interoperability, workflow composition tools, resource management, error handling, and comprehensive documentation. Utilizing these frameworks accelerates the development of scientific computing, resulting in more efficient and reproducible research outcomes. However, developing a user-friendly, efficient, and adaptable SWS poses several challenges. This study explores these challenges through an in-depth analysis of interactions on Stack Overflow (SO) and GitHub, key platforms where developers and researchers discuss and resolve issues. In particular, we leverage topic modeling (BERTopic) to understand the topics SWSs developers discuss on these platforms. We identified 10 topics developers discuss on SO (e.g., Workflow Creation and Scheduling, Data Structures and Operations, Workflow Execution) and found that workflow execution is the most challenging. By analyzing GitHub issues, we identified 13 topics (e.g., Errors and Bug Fixing, Documentation, Dependencies) and discovered that data structures and operations is the most difficult. We also found common topics between SO and GitHub, such as data structures and operations, task management, and workflow scheduling. Additionally, we categorized each topic by type (How, Why, What, and Others). We observed that the How type consistently dominates across all topics, indicating a need for procedural guidance among developers. The dominance of the How type is also evident in domains like Chatbots and Mobile development. Our study will guide future research in proposing tools and techniques to help the community overcome the challenges developers face when developing SWSs.</p></details> | 58 pages |
| **[Exploring Developer Experience Factors in Software Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19757v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Developer experience (DX) plays a key role in developers' performance and their continued involvement in a software ecosystem (SECO) platform. While researchers and practitioners have recognized several factors affecting DX in SECO platforms, a clear roadmap of the most influential factors is still missing. This is particularly important given the direct impact on developers' interest in SECO and their ongoing engagement with the common technological platform. Goal: This work aims to identify key DX factors and understand how they influence third-party developers' decisions to adopt and keep contributing to a SECO. Methods: We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS), analyzing 29 studies to assess the state-of-the-art of DX in SECO. Additionally, we conducted a Delphi study to evaluate the influence of 27 DX factors (identified in our SMS) from the perspective of 21 third-party developers to adopt and keep contributing to a SECO. Results: The factors that most strongly influence developers' adoption and ongoing contributions to a SECO are: financial costs for using the platform, desired technical resources for development, low barriers to entry into the applications market, and more financial gains. Conclusion: DX is essential for the success and sustainability of SECO. Our set of DX factors provides valuable insights and recommendations for researchers and practitioners to address key DX concerns from the perspective of third-party developers.</p></details> | 58 pages |
| **[Simulating the Waterfall Model: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19653v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This systematic mapping study examines how the Waterfall Model has been represented in computational simulations within peer-reviewed literature. While Agile methodologies dominate contemporary software design practices, the Waterfall Model persists, particularly, within hybrid approaches that fuse structured, sequential workflows with the adaptability of agile practices. Despite its continued presence, little attention has been given to how the Waterfall Model is simulated in research contexts. A structured search of major academic databases identified 68 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024. After applying inclusion criteria, selected studies were analyzed across four dimensions: (1) simulation methodologies (e.g., discrete-event simulation, system dynamics), (2) platforms and tools (e.g., Simphony.NET, SimPy), (3) geographic and temporal trends, and (4) fidelity to Royce's original seven-phase model. Discrete-event simulation was most commonly used, reflecting the model's sequential nature. Early work relied on proprietary platforms, while recent studies increasingly use open-source, Python-based tools. No studies fully implemented Royce's original formulation, most employed adaptations. These findings suggest that although niche, simulation of the Waterfall Model is present in academic discourse. This work highlights the need for accessible modeling tools and calls for future research that integrates the waterfall software process model with modern hybrid practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Verification Methodology for Safety Assurance of Robotic Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19622v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots deployed in shared human environments, such as agricultural settings, require rigorous safety assurance to meet both functional reliability and regulatory compliance. These systems must operate in dynamic, unstructured environments, interact safely with humans, and respond effectively to a wide range of potential hazards. This paper presents a verification workflow for the safety assurance of an autonomous agricultural robot, covering the entire development life-cycle, from concept study and design to runtime verification. The outlined methodology begins with a systematic hazard analysis and risk assessment to identify potential risks and derive corresponding safety requirements. A formal model of the safety controller is then developed to capture its behaviour and verify that the controller satisfies the specified safety properties with respect to these requirements. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a field robot operating in an agricultural setting. The results show that the methodology can be effectively used to verify safety-critical properties and facilitate the early identification of design issues, contributing to the development of safer robots and autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proc. of the 26th TAROS (Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems) Conference, York, UK, August, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic modelling and safety assurance of an agriculture robot providing light-treatment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19620v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continued adoption of agricultural robots postulates the farmer's trust in the reliability, robustness and safety of the new technology. This motivates our work on safety assurance of agricultural robots, particularly their ability to detect, track and avoid obstacles and humans. This paper considers a probabilistic modelling and risk analysis framework for use in the early development phases. Starting off with hazard identification and a risk assessment matrix, the behaviour of the mobile robot platform, sensor and perception system, and any humans present are captured using three state machines. An auto-generated probabilistic model is then solved and analysed using the probabilistic model checker PRISM. The result provides unique insight into fundamental development and engineering aspects by quantifying the effect of the risk mitigation actions and risk reduction associated with distinct design concepts. These include implications of adopting a higher performance and more expensive Object Detection System or opting for a more elaborate warning system to increase human awareness. Although this paper mainly focuses on the initial concept-development phase, the proposed safety assurance framework can also be used during implementation, and subsequent deployment and operation phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Replace Humans During Code Chunking?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19897v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science, especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However, existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided modernization.</p></details> |  |

Converting RegExes for Log Parsing into Dynatrace Pattern Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19539v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However, users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone. In this work, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for converting RegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a full conversion is impossible. Furthermore, it integrates GPT-4 to optimize the obtained DPL patterns. The evaluation with 946 RegExes collected from a large company shows that Reptile safely converted 73.7% of them. The evaluation of Reptile's pattern optimization with 23 real-world RegExes showed an F1-score and MCC above 0.91. These results are promising and have ample practical implications for companies that migrate to a modern log analytics platform, such as Dynatrace.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 tables, 18 figures</p></details> |

As modern systems grow in complexity, knowledge sharing and collaboration across teams have become essential. However, despite well-documented benefits of PP, its adoption remains inconsistent across software teams. Objective: This study aims to understand the factors that facilitate or hinder team members' adoption as well as lasting engagement in PP. Method: We have conducted an exploratory single-case study in a mature agile company in Norway. We collected data through two rounds of interviews with team members in different roles and performed a thematic analysis of the interviews. Results: Our key finding is that multiple factors, related to the perceptions of how PP contributes to daily work, efforts associated with engaging in PP sessions, company and team attitudes, resources, infrastructure, and task characteristics, affect PP engagement. Conclusion: Long-term engagement in PP requires expected benefits with the practice being confirmed in firsthand experiences. Adapting the practice to each unique team, with insights drawn from collective learning, is also beneficial. Our findings will be beneficial for software practitioners seeking to make PP an integrated part of their team's workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The pre-print is submitted to the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |

Investigating Binary Decomposition Under FCG Variance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19425v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary decomposition, which decomposes binary files into modules, plays a critical role in binary reuse detection. Existing binary decomposition works either apply anchor-based methods by extending anchor functions to generate modules, or apply clustering-based methods by using clustering algorithms to group binary functions, which all rely on that reused code shares similar function call relationships. However, we find that function call graphs (FCGs) vary a lot when using different compilation settings, especially with diverse function inlining decisions. In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study on the variance of FCGs compiled by various compilation settings and explore its effect on binary decomposition methods. We first construct a dataset compiled by 17 compilers, using 6 optimizations to 4 architectures and analyze the changes and mappings of the FCGs. We find that the size of FCGs changes dramatically, while the FCGs are still linked by three different kinds of mappings. Then we evaluate the existing works under the FCG variance, and results show that existing works are facing great challenges when conducting cross-compiler evaluation with diverse optimization settings. Finally, we propose a method to identify the optimal decomposition and compare the existing decomposition works with the optimal decomposition. Existing works either suffer from low coverage or cannot generate stable community similarities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Discovery of Simulation Models for Evolving Business Processes (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10049v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Business Process Simulation (BPS) refers to techniques designed to replicate the dynamic behavior of a business process. Many approaches have been proposed to automatically discover simulation models from historical event logs, reducing the cost and time to manually design them. However, in dynamic business environments, organizations continuously refine their processes to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Existing techniques to process simulation discovery lack adaptability to real-time operational changes. In this paper, we propose a streaming process simulation discovery technique that integrates Incremental Process Discovery with Online Machine Learning methods. This technique prioritizes recent data while preserving historical information, ensuring adaptation to evolving process dynamics. Experiments conducted on four different event logs demonstrate the importance in simulation of giving more weight to recent data while retaining historical knowledge. Our technique not only produces more stable simulations but also exhibits robustness in handling concept drift, as highlighted in one of the use cases.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel approach to ARM-on-ARM virtualization within SystemC-based simulators using Linux's KVM to achieve high-performance simulation. By running target software natively on ARM-based hosts with hardware-based virtualization extensions, our method eliminates the need for instruction-set simulators, which significantly improves performance. We present a multicore SystemC-TLM-based CPU model that can be used as a drop-in replacement for an instruction-set simulator. It places no special requirements on the host system, making it compatible with various environments. Benchmark results show that our ARM-on-ARM-based virtual platform achieves up to 10 x speedup over traditional instruction-set-simulator-based models on compute-intensive workloads. Depending on the benchmark, speedups increase to more than 100 x.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference 2025 (DATE '25)</p></details> |

In particular, reachability analysis is increasingly used in Open-Source Software (OSS) projects to identify reachable vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) through call graphs, enabling a focus on exploitable risks. Performing reachability analysis typically requires the vulnerable function (VF) to track the call chains from downstream applications. However, such crucial information is usually unavailable in modern vulnerability databases like NVD. While directly extracting VF from modified functions in vulnerability patches is intuitive, patches are not always available. Moreover, our preliminary study shows that over 26% of VF do not exist in the modified functions. Meanwhile, simply ignoring patches to search vulnerable functions suffers from overwhelming noises and lexical gaps between descriptions and source code. Given that almost half of the vulnerabilities are equipped with patches, a holistic solution that handles both scenarios with and without patches is required. To meet real-world needs and automatically localize VF, we present VFArch\=e, a dual-mode approach designed for disclosed vulnerabilities, applicable in scenarios with or without available patch links. The experimental results of VFArch\=e on our constructed benchmark dataset demonstrate significant efficacy regarding three metrics, achieving 1.3x and 1.9x Mean Reciprocal Rank over the best baselines for Patch-present and Patch-absent modes, respectively. Moreover, VFArch\=e has proven its applicability in real-world scenarios by successfully locating VF for 43 out of 50 latest vulnerabilities with reasonable efforts and significantly reducing 78-89% false positives of SCA tools.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We introduce MCP-Zero, an active agent framework that restores tool discovery autonomy to LLMs themselves. Instead of overwhelming models with all available tools, MCP-Zero enables agents to actively identify capability gaps, and request specific tools on-demand, transforming them from large-scale retrievers into genuine autonomous agents. The framework operates through three core mechanisms: (1) Active Tool Request, where models autonomously generate structured requests specifying their exact tool requirements; (2) Hierarchical Semantic Routing, a two-stage algorithm that matches requests to relevant servers and tools through improved semantic alignment; (3) Iterative Capability Extension, enabling agents to progressively build cross-domain toolchains while maintaining minimal context footprint. We construct MCP-tools, a comprehensive dataset of 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository. Experiments demonstrate that MCP-Zero preserves agent autonomy while achieving substantial efficiency gains: (i) accurate tool selection from nearly 3k candidates across 248.1k tokens; (ii) 98\% reduction in token consumption on APIBank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) consistent multi-turn performance that scales with tool ecosystem growth. This work establishes active tool discovery as a fundamental design pattern for scalable autonomous agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MNN-AECS: Energy Optimization for LLM Decoding on Mobile Devices via Adaptive Core Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19884v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the demand for on-device Large Language Model (LLM) inference grows, energy efficiency has become a major concern, especially for battery-limited mobile devices. Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores. MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23% without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS delivers 39% to 78% energy saving and 12% to 363% speedup on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating and Understanding Tests via Path-Aware Symbolic Execution with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19287v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering systematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code including library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead constructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the first to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are actually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and visualization of their path profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynNPC: Finding More Violations Induced by ADS in Simulation Testing through Dynamic NPC Behavior Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19567v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a number of simulation testing approaches have been proposed to generate diverse driving scenarios for autonomous driving systems (ADSs) testing. However, the behaviors of NPC vehicles in these scenarios generated by previous approaches are predefined and mutated before simulation execution, ignoring traffic signals and the behaviors of the Ego vehicle. Thus, a large number of the violations they found are induced by unrealistic behaviors of NPC vehicles, revealing no bugs of ADSs. Besides, the vast scenario search space of NPC behaviors during the iterative mutations limits the efficiency of previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a novel scenario-based testing framework, DynNPC, to generate more violation scenarios induced by the ADS. Specifically, DynNPC allows NPC vehicles to dynamically generate behaviors using different driving strategies during simulation execution based on traffic signals and the real-time behavior of the Ego vehicle. We compare DynNPC with five state-of-the-art scenario-based testing approaches. Our evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of DynNPC in finding more violation scenarios induced by the ADS.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroupTuner: Efficient Group-Aware Compiler Auto-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08598v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern compilers typically provide hundreds of options to optimize program performance, but users often cannot fully leverage them due to the huge number of options. While standard optimization combinations (e.g., -O3) provide reasonable defaults, they often fail to deliver near-peak performance across diverse programs and architectures. To address this challenge, compiler auto-tuning techniques have emerged to automate the discovery of improved option combinations. Existing techniques typically focus on identifying critical options and prioritizing them during the search to improve efficiency. However, due to limited tuning iterations, the resulting data is often sparse and noisy, making it highly challenging to accurately identify critical options. As a result, these algorithms are prone to being trapped in local optima. To address this limitation, we propose GroupTuner, a group-aware auto-tuning technique that directly applies localized mutation to coherent option groups based on historically best-performing combinations, thus avoiding explicitly identifying critical options. By forgoing the need to know precisely which options are most important, GroupTuner maximizes the use of existing performance data, ensuring more targeted exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GroupTuner can efficiently discover competitive option combinations, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.39% over -O3 while requiring only 77.21% of the time compared to the random search algorithm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in the ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES'25), June 16-17, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea</p></details> |
| **[Breaking Single-Tester Limits: Multi-Agent LLMs for Multi-User Feature Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17539v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing dependence on mobile phones and their apps has made multi-user interactive features, like chat calls, live streaming, and video conferencing, indispensable for bridging the gaps in social connectivity caused by physical and situational barriers. However, automating these interactive features for testing is fraught with challenges, owing to their inherent need for timely, dynamic, and collaborative user interactions, which current automated testing methods inadequately address. Inspired by the concept of agents designed to autonomously and collaboratively tackle problems, we propose MAdroid, a novel multi-agent approach powered by the Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the multi-user interactive task for app feature testing. Specifically, MAdroid employs two functional types of multi-agents: user agents (Operator) and supervisor agents (Coordinator and Observer). Each agent takes a specific role: the Coordinator directs the interactive task; the Operator mimics user interactions on the device; and the Observer monitors and reviews the task automation process. Our evaluation, which included 41 multi-user interactive tasks, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 82.9% of the tasks with 96.8% action similarity, outperforming the ablation studies and state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a preliminary investigation underscores MAdroid's practicality by helping identify 11 multi-user interactive bugs during regression app testing, confirming its potential value in real-world software development contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2504.15474</p></details> |

These contracts were generated through the compilation of Solidity source files that have been deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, making the dataset directly representative of real-world decentralized applications. YulCode provides a rich foundation for a variety of research and development tasks, including but not limited to machine learning applications, formal verification, optimization analysis, and software engineering tool evaluation in the context of low-level smart contract code. To the best of our knowledge at the time of writing, YulCode is the first and only publicly available dataset that focuses specifically on Yul, an intermediate language designed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). As such, it fills a critical gap in the current ecosystem of smart contract datasets and opens new avenues for research and tooling aimed at low-level contract analysis and generation.</p></details> | 4 pages |

However, these models still exhibit notable mispredictions in real-world applications, even when trained on up-to-date data. Such failures often arise from slight variations in inputs such as minor syntax changes in code, rephrasing in text, or subtle lighting shifts in images that reveal inherent limitations in these models' capability to generalize effectively. Traditional approaches to address these challenges involve retraining, a resource-intensive process that demands significant investments in data labeling, model updates, and redeployment. This research introduces an adaptive, on-the-fly input refinement framework aimed at improving model performance through input validation and transformation. The input validation component detects inputs likely to cause errors, while input transformation applies domain-specific adjustments to better align these inputs with the model's handling capabilities. This dual strategy reduces mispredictions across various domains, boosting model performance without necessitating retraining. As a scalable and resource-efficient solution, this framework holds significant promise for high-stakes applications in software engineering, natural language processing, and computer vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE/ACM 47th International Conference on Software Engineering: Companion Proceedings (ICSE-Companion)</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Existing LLM serving systems employs Continuous Batching for throughput improvement. However, they rely on static batch size configurations that cannot adapt to fluctuating request rates or heterogeneous workloads, leading to frequent SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations and unstable performance. In this study, We propose SABER, a dynamic batching strategy that predicts per-request SLA feasibility and adjusts decisions in real time. SABER improves goodput by up to 26% over the best static configurations and reduces latency variability by up to 45%, all without manual tuning or service restarts. Our results demonstrate that SLA-aware, adaptive scheduling is key to robust, high-performance CodeLLM serving.</p></details> |  |

However, code-comment inconsistency (CCI) can negatively affect software development, testing, and maintenance. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue have emerged, but existing studies often suffer from inaccurate datasets and inadequate solutions, weakening their practical effectiveness. In this study, we first conduct a quantitative analysis of existing datasets, revealing a substantial portion of sampled data are mislabeled. To address these data limitations, we introduce CCIBench, a refined dataset comprising high-quality data, to support the training and evaluation of method-level CCI methods. Furthermore, we present an innovative end-to-end LLM-based framework, CCISolver, designed to improve code quality by identifying and rectifying CCIs. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate CCISolver's superior performance. For detection, it establishes a new state-of-the-art with an F1-score of 89.54%. In fixing task, it achieves a remarkable 18.84% relative improvement in GLEU score over the strongest baseline. This superiority is confirmed by human evaluation, where CCISolver's fixing success rate of 0.6533 significantly surpasses existing methods. Critically, in a practical end-to-end setting, CCISolver's innovative architecture is approximately 36% faster for inference than the baseline model, underscoring its scalability and real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review</p></details> |

The developed system integrates LLMs such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama, with Revit software to interpret building codes, generate Python scripts, and perform semi-automated compliance checks within the BIM environment. Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions, material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured reliable adherence to standards.

This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6\% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9\% performance improvement over the base MARCO system.

| **[VulStamp: Vulnerability Assessment using Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11484v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern vulnerability detection tools enable developers to efficiently identify numerous security flaws, indiscriminate remediation efforts often lead to superfluous development expenses. This is particularly true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency. Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types, VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to train the assessment model.</p></details> |  |

We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees. Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the LLM, a form of access commonly available. We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores ( $\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack). We introduce QHackBench, a novel benchmark dataset derived from QHack competitions, and evaluate model performance under vanilla prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our structured evaluation framework assesses functional correctness, syntactic validity, and execution success across varying challenge difficulties. Results indicate that RAG-enhanced models, supplemented with an augmented PennyLane dataset, approximately generate similar results as the standard prompting, particularly in complex quantum algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that iteratively refines incorrect solutions, further enhancing execution success rates. To foster further research, we commit to publicly releasing QHackBench, along with our evaluation framework and experimental results, enabling continued advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, submitted to QAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can Language Models Replace Programmers for Coding? REPOCOD Says 'Not Yet'](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21647v4)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a number of repository-level code generation benchmarks-such as CoderEval, DevEval, RepoEval, RepoBench, and LongCodeArena-have emerged to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond standalone benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. Thus, a natural question is, would LLMs have similar performance in real world coding tasks as their performance in these benchmarks? Unfortunately, one cannot answer this question, since these benchmarks consist of short completions, synthetic examples, or focus on limited scale repositories, failing to represent real-world coding tasks. To address these challenges, we create REPOCOD, a Python code-generation benchmark containing complex tasks with realistic dependencies in real-world large projects and appropriate metrics for evaluating source code. It includes 980 whole-function generation tasks from 11 popular projects, 50.8% of which require repository-level context. REPOCOD includes 314 developer-written test cases per instance for better evaluation. We evaluate ten LLMs on REPOCOD and find that none achieves more than 30% pass@1 on REPOCOD, indicating the necessity of building stronger LLMs that can help developers in real-world software development. In addition, we found that retrieval-augmented generation achieves better results than using target function dependencies as context.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating source code, two major challenges persist in UI-to-HTML code generation: (1) effectively representing HTML's hierarchical structure for LLMs, and (2) bridging the gap between the visual nature of UI designs and the text-based format of HTML code. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Waffle, a new fine-tuning strategy that uses a structure-aware attention mechanism to improve LLMs' understanding of HTML's structure and a contrastive fine-tuning approach to align LLMs' understanding of UI images and HTML code. Models fine-tuned with Waffle show up to 9.00 pp (percentage point) higher HTML match, 0.0982 higher CW-SSIM, 32.99 higher CLIP, and 27.12 pp higher LLEM on our new benchmark WebSight-Test and an existing benchmark Design2Code, outperforming current fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption. [Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns, aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity, though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to adopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated approach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while aligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 51st Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA) 2025</p></details> |

These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Smart Cuts: Enhance Active Learning for Vulnerability Detection by Pruning Bad Seeds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20444v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability detection is crucial for identifying security weaknesses in software systems. However, the effectiveness of machine learning models in this domain is often hindered by low-quality training datasets, which contain noisy, mislabeled, or imbalanced samples. This paper proposes a novel dataset maps-empowered approach that systematically identifies and mitigates hard-to-learn outliers, referred to as "bad seeds", to improve model training efficiency. Our approach can categorize training examples based on learning difficulty and integrate this information into an active learning framework. Unlike traditional methods that focus on uncertainty-based sampling, our strategy prioritizes dataset quality by filtering out performance-harmful samples while emphasizing informative ones. Our experimental results show that our approach can improve F1 score over random selection by 45.36% (DeepGini) and 45.91% (K-Means) and outperforms standard active learning by 61.46% (DeepGini) and 32.65% (K-Means) for CodeBERT on the Big-Vul dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating dataset maps for optimizing sample selection in vulnerability detection. Furthermore, our approach also enhances model robustness, improves sample selection by filtering bad seeds, and stabilizes active learning performance across iterations. By analyzing the characteristics of these outliers, we provide insights for future improvements in dataset construction, making vulnerability detection more reliable and cost-effective.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Composition of Digital Twins for Systems-of-Systems: a Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20435v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins (DTs) are increasingly used to model complex systems, especially in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and System-of-Systems (SoS), where effective integration is key. This systematic literature review investigates DT composition and verification and validation (V&V) methodologies. Analyzing 21 studies from 2022-2024, we examined composition mechanisms, SoS characteristics, and V&V formality, scope, and challenges. While composition is discussed, formalization is limited. V&V approaches vary, with semi-formal methods and simulations dominating; formal verification is underutilized. Key technical challenges include model uncertainty and integration complexity. Methodological challenges highlight the lack of standardized DT-specific V&V frameworks. There is a need to move beyond model validation to address integration and cyber-physical consistency. This review contributes a structured classification of V&V approaches and emphasizes the need for standardized, scalable V&V and rigorous composition methodologies for complex DT implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, Presented at the 23rd Overture workshop, June 2025 (arXiv:cs/2506.08680)</p></details> |
