| **[Comparative Analysis of LLM Abliteration Methods: A Cross-Architecture Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13655v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment mechanisms in large language models prevent responses to harmful queries through learned refusal behavior, yet these same mechanisms impede legitimate research applications including cognitive modeling, adversarial testing, and security analysis. While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v4)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final preprint (revision #3) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[How Low Can You Go? The Data-Light SE Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13524v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested? The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization). Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.

| **[Fine-tuned LLM-based Code Migration Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13515v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems. The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 27 figures, 7 references</p></details> |
| **[Mapping of the system of software-related emissions and shared responsibilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13474v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global climate is experiencing a rapid and unprecedented warming trend. The ICT sector is a notable contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, with its environmental impact continuing to expand. Addressing this issue is vital for achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, particularly the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. At the European Union level, regulatory measures such as the CSRD and the CSDD impose obligations on companies, including those within the ICT sector, to recognize and mitigate their environmental footprint. This study provides a comprehensive system mapping aimed at enhancing the awareness and understanding of software-related emissions and the corresponding responsibilities borne by the ICT sector. The mapping identifies the primary sources of carbon emissions and energy consumption within the ICT domain while also outlining the key responsibilities of the stakeholders accountable throughout the software lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, 2025 IEEE/ACM 9th International Workshop on Green and Sustainable Software (GREENS)</p></details> |
| **[A Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13444v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of AI-enabled cyber-physical systems, data annotation has become a critical yet often overlooked process in the development of these intelligent information systems. Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, currently submitted and under review</p></details> |
| **[From User Interface to Agent Interface: Efficiency Optimization of UI Representations for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13438v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great potential for automated UI navigation such as automated UI testing and AI assistants, their efficiency has been largely overlooked. Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[QMon: Monitoring the Execution of Quantum Circuits with Mid-Circuit Measurement and Reset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13422v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike classical software, where logging and runtime tracing can effectively reveal internal execution status, quantum circuits possess unique properties, such as the no-cloning theorem and measurement-induced collapse, that prevent direct observation or duplication of their states. These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSALM: applying Proportional SAmpLing strategy in Metamorphic testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13414v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing (MT) alleviates the oracle problem by checking metamorphic relations (MRs) across multiple test executions. The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 27 figures, 7 references</p></details> |

Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, currently submitted and under review</p></details> |
| **[From User Interface to Agent Interface: Efficiency Optimization of UI Representations for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13438v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great potential for automated UI navigation such as automated UI testing and AI assistants, their efficiency has been largely overlooked. Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[QMon: Monitoring the Execution of Quantum Circuits with Mid-Circuit Measurement and Reset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13422v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike classical software, where logging and runtime tracing can effectively reveal internal execution status, quantum circuits possess unique properties, such as the no-cloning theorem and measurement-induced collapse, that prevent direct observation or duplication of their states. These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature.</p></details> |  |

The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT.</p></details> |  |

While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v4)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final preprint (revision #3) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |

Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested? The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization). Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.

UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer.</p></details> |  |

These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature.</p></details> |  |

The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT.</p></details> |  |

While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final preprint (revision #3) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |

The Data-Light SE Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13524v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested? The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization). Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 27 figures, 7 references</p></details> |

Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, currently submitted and under review</p></details> |

Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance.

We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final preprint (revision #3) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |

The Data-Light SE Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13524v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested? The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization). Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 27 figures, 7 references</p></details> |

Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, currently submitted and under review</p></details> |
| **[From User Interface to Agent Interface: Efficiency Optimization of UI Representations for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13438v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great potential for automated UI navigation such as automated UI testing and AI assistants, their efficiency has been largely overlooked. Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer.</p></details> |  |

These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature.</p></details> |  |

The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT.</p></details> |  |

While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, currently submitted and under review</p></details> |
| **[From User Interface to Agent Interface: Efficiency Optimization of UI Representations for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13438v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great potential for automated UI navigation such as automated UI testing and AI assistants, their efficiency has been largely overlooked. Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer.</p></details> |  |

These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSALM: applying Proportional SAmpLing strategy in Metamorphic testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13414v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing (MT) alleviates the oracle problem by checking metamorphic relations (MRs) across multiple test executions. The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT.</p></details> |  |

While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final preprint (revision #3) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |

The Data-Light SE Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13524v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested? The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization). Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 27 figures, 7 references</p></details> |

This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT.</p></details> |  |

While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v4)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final preprint (revision #3) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[How Low Can You Go? The Data-Light SE Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13524v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested? The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization). Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail. For the purposes of open science, our scripts and data are online at https://github.com/KKGanguly/NEO .</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuned LLM-based Code Migration Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13515v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems. The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 27 figures, 7 references</p></details> |
| **[Mapping of the system of software-related emissions and shared responsibilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13474v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global climate is experiencing a rapid and unprecedented warming trend. The ICT sector is a notable contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, with its environmental impact continuing to expand. Addressing this issue is vital for achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, particularly the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. At the European Union level, regulatory measures such as the CSRD and the CSDD impose obligations on companies, including those within the ICT sector, to recognize and mitigate their environmental footprint. This study provides a comprehensive system mapping aimed at enhancing the awareness and understanding of software-related emissions and the corresponding responsibilities borne by the ICT sector. The mapping identifies the primary sources of carbon emissions and energy consumption within the ICT domain while also outlining the key responsibilities of the stakeholders accountable throughout the software lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, 2025 IEEE/ACM 9th International Workshop on Green and Sustainable Software (GREENS)</p></details> |
| **[A Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13444v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of AI-enabled cyber-physical systems, data annotation has become a critical yet often overlooked process in the development of these intelligent information systems. Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, currently submitted and under review</p></details> |
| **[From User Interface to Agent Interface: Efficiency Optimization of UI Representations for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13438v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great potential for automated UI navigation such as automated UI testing and AI assistants, their efficiency has been largely overlooked. Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[QMon: Monitoring the Execution of Quantum Circuits with Mid-Circuit Measurement and Reset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13422v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike classical software, where logging and runtime tracing can effectively reveal internal execution status, quantum circuits possess unique properties, such as the no-cloning theorem and measurement-induced collapse, that prevent direct observation or duplication of their states. These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature.</p></details> |  |

The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT.</p></details> |  |
