With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |

Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://livecodebenchpro.com/</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on LLM-Based Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02509v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern code completion engines, powered by large language models (LLMs), assist millions of developers with their strong capabilities to generate functionally correct code. Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |

However, employing tools like GeoPandas, a prominent Python library for geospatial data manipulation, necessitates expertise in complex domain-specific syntax and workflows. GeoPandas-AI addresses this gap by integrating LLMs directly into the GeoPandas workflow, transforming the GeoDataFrame class into an intelligent, stateful class for both data analysis and geospatial code development. This paper formalizes the design of such a smart class and provides an open-source implementation of GeoPandas-AI in PyPI package manager. Through its innovative combination of conversational interfaces and stateful exploitation of LLMs for code generation and data analysis, GeoPandas-AI introduces a new paradigm for code-copilots and instantiates it for geospatial development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

Vulnerability repair investigates how to fix software vulnerabilities. Manual vulnerability repair is labor-intensive and time-consuming because it relies on human experts, highlighting the importance of Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR). In this SoK, we present the systematization of AVR methods through the three steps of AVR workflow: vulnerability analysis, patch generation, and patch validation. We assess AVR tools for C/C++ and Java programs as they have been widely studied by the community. Since existing AVR tools for C/C++ programs are evaluated with different datasets, which often consist of a few vulnerabilities, we construct the first C/C++ vulnerability repair benchmark dataset, dubbed Vul4C, which contains 144 vulnerabilities as well as their exploits and patches. We use Vul4C to evaluate seven AVR tools for C/C++ programs and use the third-party Vul4J dataset to evaluate two AVR tools for Java programs. We also discuss future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The full version of "SoK: Automated Vulnerability Repair: Methods, Tools, and Assessments" accepted by the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2025)</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical study on LLM-based Log Retrieval for Software Engineering Metadata Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11659v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing autonomous driving systems (ADSs) involves generating and storing extensive log data from test drives, which is essential for verification, research, and simulation. However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over varying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific driving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals representing various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as unfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals. Traditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both domain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are difficult to verify for accuracy. This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that combines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling natural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for specialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap indicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of query results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database querying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for intuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates improved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating dependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Property-based Test Generation for Guardrailing Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23549v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems that integrate physical, computational, and communication subsystems. The heterogeneous nature of these systems makes their safety assurance challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach for guardrailing cyber-physical systems using property-based tests (PBTs) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs an LLM to extract properties from the code and documentation of CPSs. Next, we use the LLM to generate PBTs that verify the extracted properties on the CPS. The generated PBTs have two uses. First, they are used to test the CPS before it is deployed, i.e., at design time. Secondly, these PBTs can be used after deployment, i.e., at run time, to monitor the behavior of the system and guardrail it against unsafe states. We implement our approach in ChekProp and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the generated PBTs in terms of their relevance (how well they match manually crafted properties), executability (how many run with minimal manual modification), and effectiveness (coverage of the input space partitions). The results of our experiments and evaluation demonstrate a promising path forward for creating guardrails for CPSs using LLM-generated property-based tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[KEENHash: Hashing Programs into Function-Aware Embeddings for Large-Scale Binary Code Similarity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11612v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |

We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD.

Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%.

Knowing how clients are using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug reports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of a bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API is used. In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage across 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a combined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how well library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for library developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API usage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that library developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use their API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a popular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by the library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be leveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7% with the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the APIs are used in the field. For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be used to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce various metrics useful to library developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, 17 to 20 June, 2025, Istanbul, Turkey</p></details> |

| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Hessian-Based Insights Support Fault Diagnosis in Attention-based Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07871v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity, diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis) and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRepair: An Exploratory Study on Merging Task-Specific Adapters in Code LLMs for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09568v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown high capabilities in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, 34% of reported issues are quantum-specific, highlighting the need for specialized debugging tools beyond conventional software engineering approaches. This study provides empirical insights into the software engineering challenges of quantum computing, offering recommendations to improve development workflows, tooling, and documentation. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Identify Flakiness in C++ Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12340v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of regression testing in software testing is crucial as it ensures that any new modifications do not disrupt the existing functionality and behaviour of the software system. The desired outcome is for regression tests to yield identical results without any modifications made to the system being tested. In practice, however, the presence of Flaky Tests introduces non-deterministic behaviour and undermines the reliability of regression testing results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for identifying the root cause of flaky tests in C++ projects at the code level, with the intention of assisting developers in debugging and resolving them more efficiently. We compile a comprehensive collection of C++ project flaky tests sourced from GitHub repositories. We fine-tune Mistral-7b, Llama2-7b and CodeLlama-7b models on the C++ dataset and an existing Java dataset and evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We assess the performance of the models across various datasets and offer recommendations for both research and industry applications. The results indicate that our models exhibit varying performance on the C++ dataset, while their performance is comparable to that of the Java dataset. The Mistral-7b surpasses the other two models regarding all metrics, achieving a score of 1. Our results demonstrate the exceptional capability of LLMs to accurately classify flakiness in C++ and Java projects, providing a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of debugging flaky tests in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM-Based Fault Localization with External Memory and Project Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03585v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 7 figures |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

However, existing debuggers are primarily tailored for human interaction, and those designed for programmatic debugging focus on kernel space, resulting in limited functionality in userland. To fill this gap, we introduce libdebug, a Python library for programmatic debugging of userland binary executables. libdebug offers a user-friendly API that enables developers to build custom debugging tools for various applications, including software engineering, reverse engineering, and software security. It is released as an open-source project, along with comprehensive documentation to encourage use and collaboration across the community. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of libdebug through case studies and benchmarks, all of which are publicly available. We find that the median latency of syscall and breakpoint handling in libdebug is 3 to 4 times lower compared to that of GDB.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAMBDA: A Large Model Based Data Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17535v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large language models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

This work introduces JITScope, an interactive visualization framework that illustrates how IR nodes and instructions evolve across compilation phases. The system features a full-stack architecture: a Python-based backend transforms raw JSON-formatted IR data-representing an abstract model of the JIT compiler IR-into a normalized SQLite database; a controller layer serves processed CSV data; and a D3.js-powered frontend renders an interactive, phase-aware graph of IR node transformations. The design emphasizes modularity, traceability, and flexibility. Our roadmap explores intuitive visual representations of phase-level changes in IR node connectivity, values, and access patterns. Ultimately, JITScope lays a foundation for future tooling that enables visual exploration of IR evolution, including phase filtering, value tracking, and function-access mapping-offering a new lens into the behaviors and impacts of compiler optimizations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 8 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

The chapter considers a debugging process in which a program is tested against different test cases. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test case. The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software, GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a unique corresponding event handler.</p></details> |  |

Virtual Platforms (VPs) have become indispensable tools for this purpose as they serve as a platform to execute and debug the unmodified target software at an early design stage. With the increasing complexity of software, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, VPs need to provide high simulation speed to ensure the target software executes within a reasonable time. Hybrid simulation, which combines virtual models with real hardware, can improve the performance of VPs. This paper introduces a novel approach for integrating real Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices into SystemC-TLM-2.0-based VPs. The embedded PCI devices enable high performance, easy integration, and allow introspection for analysis and optimization. To illustrate the practical application of our approach, we present a case study where we integrate Google Coral's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) into an ARM-based VP. The integration allows efficient execution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while eliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating AI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression testing across architectures, and device communication analysis.

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |

Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Better Understanding of Probabilistic Delta Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04735v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.</p></details> | accepted by ICSE25 |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing LLM Code Generation: A Systematic Evaluation of Multi-Agent Collaboration and Runtime Debugging for Improved Accuracy, Reliability, and Latency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02133v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models (LLMs) for automated code generation has emerged as a significant focus within AI research. As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |
| **[Towards Source Mapping for Zero-Knowledge Smart Contracts: Design and Preliminary Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04322v4)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and auditing zero-knowledge-compatible smart contracts remains a significant challenge due to the lack of source mapping in compilers such as zkSolc. In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.</p></details> |  |

Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Code-Edit Embedding to Model Student Debugging Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19407v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing effective feedback for programming assignments in computer science education can be challenging: students solve problems by iteratively submitting code, executing it, and using limited feedback from the compiler or the auto-grader to debug. Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025)</p></details> |

Exploring the Use of Android Record & Replay Tools in Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20237v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android User Interface (UI) testing is a critical research area due to the ubiquity of apps and the challenges faced by developers. Record and replay (R&R) tools facilitate manual and automated UI testing by recording UI actions to execute test scenarios and replay bugs. These tools typically support (i) regression testing, (ii) non-crashing functional bug reproduction, and (iii) crashing bug reproduction. However, prior work only examines these tools in fragmented settings, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across common use cases. We address this gap by conducting an empirical study on using R&R tools to record and replay non-crashing failures, crashing bugs, and feature-based user scenarios, and explore combining R&R with automated input generation (AIG) tools to replay crashing bugs. Our study involves one industrial and three academic R&R tools, 34 scenarios from 17 apps, 90 non-crashing failures from 42 apps, and 31 crashing bugs from 17 apps. Results show that 17% of scenarios, 38% of non-crashing bugs, and 44% of crashing bugs cannot be reliably recorded and replayed, mainly due to action interval resolution, API incompatibility, and Android tooling limitations. Our findings highlight key future research directions to enhance the practical application of R&R tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MobileSoft 2025</p></details> |

Put some Whamm on it!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20192v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and monitoring programs are integral to engineering and deploying software. Dynamic analyses monitor applications through source code or IR injection, machine code or bytecode rewriting, and virtual machine or direct hardware support. While these techniques are viable within their respective domains, common tooling across techniques is rare, leading to fragmentation of skills, duplicated efforts, and inconsistent feature support. We address this problem in the WebAssembly ecosystem with Whamm, a declarative instrumentation DSL for WebAssembly that abstracts above the instrumentation strategy, leveraging bytecode rewriting and engine support as available. Whamm solves three problems: 1) tooling fragmentation, 2) prohibitive instrumentation overhead of general-purpose frameworks, and 3) tedium of tailoring low-level high-performance mechanisms. Whamm provides fully-programmable instrumentation with declarative match rules, static and dynamic predication, automatic state reporting, and user library support, while achieving high performance through compiler and engine optimizations. At the back end, Whamm provides instrumentation to a Wasm engine as Wasm code, reusing existing engine optimizations and unlocking new ones, most notably intrinsification, to minimize overhead. In particular, explicitly requesting program state in match rules, rather than reflection, enables the engine to efficiently bundle arguments and even inline compiled probe logic. Whamm streamlines the tooling effort, as its bytecode-rewriting target can run instrumented programs everywhere, lowering fragmentation and advancing the state of the art for engine support. We evaluate Whamm with case studies of non-trivial monitors and show it is expressive, powerful, and efficient.</p></details> |  |

We present Sojourner under Sabotage, a browser-based serious game that enhances learning through interactive, narrative-driven challenges. Players act as spaceship crew members, using unit tests and debugging techniques to fix sabotaged components. Sojourner under Sabotage provides hands-on experience with the real-world testing framework JUnit, improving student engagement, test coverage, and debugging skills.</p></details> |  |

Sojourner under Sabotage, a browser-based serious game, reimagines this learning experience by blending education with an immersive and interactive storyline. Players take on the role of a spaceship crew member, using unit testing and debugging techniques to identify and repair sabotaged components across seven progressively challenging levels. A study with 79 students demonstrates that the game is a powerful tool for enhancing motivation, engagement, and skill development. These findings underscore the transformative potential of serious games in making essential software engineering practices accessible and enjoyable.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriDebug: A Unified LLM for Verilog Debugging via Contrastive Embedding and Guided Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19099v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in debugging for various programming languages. However, the application of LLMs to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging. Unlike existing methods, VeriDebug employs an embedding-based technique to accurately retrieve internal information, followed by bug-fixing. VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves 64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo (36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring Questions from Programming Screenshots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18912v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of generative AI into developer forums like Stack Overflow presents an opportunity to enhance problem-solving by allowing users to post screenshots of code or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) instead of traditional text-based queries. This study evaluates the effectiveness of various large language models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA, GEMINI, and GPT-4o in interpreting such visual inputs. We employ prompt engineering techniques, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot learning, to assess each model's responsiveness and accuracy. Our findings show that while GPT-4o shows promising capabilities, achieving over 60% similarity to baseline questions for 51.75% of the tested images, challenges remain in obtaining consistent and accurate interpretations for more complex images. This research advances our understanding of the feasibility of using generative AI for image-centric problem-solving in developer communities, highlighting both the potential benefits and current limitations of this approach while envisioning a future where visual-based debugging copilot tools become a reality.</p></details> |  |

Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability, especially their error rates across domains and the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o). Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025. Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error distributions. Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50% with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%. Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over 50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates (~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability (10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability. Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from biological healing - where the human body detects damage, signals the brain, and activates targeted recovery - this paper explores the concept of self-healing software driven by artificial intelligence. We propose a novel framework that mimics this biological model system observability tools serve as sensory inputs, AI models function as the cognitive core for diagnosis and repair, and healing agents apply targeted code and test modifications. By combining log analysis, static code inspection, and AI-driven generation of patches or test updates, our approach aims to reduce downtime, accelerate debugging, and enhance software resilience. We evaluate the effectiveness of this model through case studies and simulations, comparing it against traditional manual debugging and recovery workflows. This work paves the way toward intelligent, adaptive and self-reliant software systems capable of continuous healing, akin to living organisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Interactive Debugger for Rust Trait Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18704v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiler diagnostics for type inference failures are notoriously bad, and type classes only make the problem worse. By introducing a complex search process during inference, type classes can lead to wholly inscrutable or useless errors. We describe a system, Argus, for interactively visualizing type class inferences to help programmers debug inference failures, applied specifically to Rust's trait system. The core insight of Argus is to avoid the traditional model of compiler diagnostics as one-size-fits-all, instead providing the programmer with different views on the search tree corresponding to different debugging goals. Argus carefully uses defaults to improve debugging productivity, including interface design (e.g., not showing full paths of types by default) and heuristics (e.g., sorting obligations based on the expected complexity of fixing them). We evaluated Argus in a user study where $N = 25$ participants debugged type inference failures in realistic Rust programs, finding that participants using Argus correctly localized $2.2\times$ as many faults and localized $3.3\times$ faster compared to not using Argus.</p></details> |  |

These missing links and data obstruct both developers and, more recently, large language models (LLMs) working with unfamiliar code. We present Codetations, a system that helps developers contextualize documents with rich notes and tools. Unlike previous approaches, notes in Codetations stay outside the document to prevent code clutter, attaching to spans in the document using a hybrid edit-tracking/LLM-based method. Their content is dynamic, interactive, and synchronized with code changes. A worked example shows that relevant notes with interactively-collected data improve LLM performance during code repair. In our user evaluation, developers praised these properties and saw significant potential in annotation types that we generated with an LLM in just a few minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design, where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix, we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct their software goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, FSE2025</p></details> |

Diffing Build Logs with CiDiff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18182v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous integration (CI) is widely used by developers to ensure the quality and reliability of their software projects. However, diagnosing a CI regression is a tedious process that involves the manual analysis of lengthy build logs. In this paper, we explore how textual differencing can support the debugging of CI regressions. As off-the-shelf diff algorithms produce suboptimal results, in this work we introduce a new diff algorithm specifically tailored to build logs called CiDiff. We evaluate CiDiff against several baselines on a novel dataset of 17 906 CI regressions, performing an accuracy study, a quantitative study and a user-study. Notably, our algorithm reduces the number of lines to inspect by about 60 % in the median case, with reasonable overhead compared to the state-of-practice LCS-diff. Finally, our algorithm is preferred by the majority of participants in 70 % of the regression cases, whereas LCS-diff is preferred in only 5 % of the cases.</p></details> |  |

(2) Showcases modern features, including per-app address spaces, threading, commodity filesystems, USB, DMA, multicore, self-hosted debugging, and a window manager. (3) Supports rich applications such as 2D/3D games, music and video players, and a blockchain miner. Unlike traditional instructional systems, VOS emphasizes strong motivation for building systems-supporting engaging, media-rich apps that go beyond basic terminal programs. To achieve this, we design VOS to strike a careful balance between essential OS complexity and overall simplicity. Our method, which we call inverse engineering, breaks down a full-featured OS into a set of incremental, self-contained prototypes. Each prototype introduces a minimal set of OS mechanisms, driven by the needs of specific apps. The construction process (i.e., forward engineering) then progressively enables these apps by bringing up one mechanism at a time. VOS makes it accessible for a wider audience to experience building a software system that is self-contained and usable in everyday scenarios.</p></details> |  |

General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2025 AI4EDU Workshop</p></details> |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, to appear at FSE 2025</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up industrial survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 17 images, 8 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, the lack of high-quality, scalable training datasets, especially those with verifiable outputs and intermediate reasoning traces-limits progress, particularly for open-source models. In this work, we present SWE-Synth, a framework for synthesizing realistic, verifiable, and process-aware bug-fix datasets at the repository level. SWE-Synth leverages LLM agents to simulate debugging workflows, producing not only bug-fix pairs but also test cases and structured repair trajectories. Compared to manually curated datasets, our method scales with minimal human effort while preserving contextual richness and correctness. Experiments show that models trained on SWE-Synth outperform those trained on real-world datasets by 2.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic, agent-generated data to advance the state of the art in APR and software engineering automation.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the complexity inherent to AI poses new challenges. Explainable AI (XAI) may allow developers to understand better the systems they build, which, in turn, can help with tasks like debugging. In this paper, we report insights from a series of surveys with software developers that highlight that there is indeed an increased need for explanatory tools to support developers in creating AI systems. However, the feedback also indicates that existing XAI systems still fall short of this aspiration. Thus, we see an unmet need to provide developers with adequate support mechanisms to cope with this complexity so they can embed AI into high-quality software in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Engineering Interactive Systems Embedding AI Technologies at EICS 2024, Tuesday June 25th, 2024 - Cagliary, Sardinia, Italy</p></details> |
| **[ChaosEater: Fully Automating Chaos Engineering with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11107v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chaos Engineering (CE) is an engineering technique aimed at improving the resiliency of distributed systems. It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools implement the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose ChaosEater, a system for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines the agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for Kubernetes systems, which are managed through code (i.e., Infrastructure as Code). Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater perform software engineering tasks to complete CE cycles, including requirement definition, code generation, debugging, and testing. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on both small and large Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it stably completes reasonable single CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. The CE cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>114 p...</summary><p>114 pages (7 main), 11 figures.

| **[Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15756v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timing Analysis Agent: Autonomous Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) Timing Debugging with Timing Debug Relation Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11502v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timing analysis is an essential and demanding verification method for Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuit design and optimization. In addition, it also serves as the cornerstone of the final sign-off, determining whether the chip is ready to be sent to the semiconductor foundry for fabrication. Recently, as the technology advance relentlessly, smaller metal pitches and the increasing number of devices have led to greater challenges and longer turn-around-time for experienced human designers to debug timing issues from the Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) timing reports. As a result, an efficient and intelligent methodology is highly necessary and essential for debugging timing issues and reduce the turnaround times. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise across various tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, incorporating reasoning and actions. In this work, we propose a timing analysis agent, that is empowered by multi-LLMs task solving, and incorporates a novel hierarchical planning and solving flow to automate the analysis of timing reports from commercial tool. In addition, we build a Timing Debug Relation Graph (TDRG) that connects the reports with the relationships of debug traces from experienced timing engineers. The timing analysis agent employs the novel Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, that includes agent and coding to retrieve data accurately, on the developed TDRG. In our studies, the proposed timing analysis agent achieves an average 98% pass-rate on a single-report benchmark and a 90% pass-rate for multi-report benchmark from industrial designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent That Debugs: Dynamic State-Guided Vulnerability Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07634v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, more vulnerabilities have been discovered every day, while manual vulnerability repair requires specialized knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, many detected or even published vulnerabilities remain unpatched, thereby increasing the exposure of software systems to attacks. Recent advancements in agents based on Large Language Models have demonstrated their increasing capabilities in code understanding and generation, which can be promising to achieve automated vulnerability repair. However, the effectiveness of agents based on static information retrieval is still not sufficient for patch generation. To address the challenge, we propose a program repair agent called VulDebugger that fully utilizes both static and dynamic context, and it debugs programs in a manner akin to humans. The agent inspects the actual state of the program via the debugger and infers expected states via constraints that need to be satisfied. By continuously comparing the actual state with the expected state, it deeply understands the root causes of the vulnerabilities and ultimately accomplishes repairs. We experimentally evaluated VulDebugger on 50 real-life projects. With 60.00% successfully fixed, VulDebugger significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for vulnerability repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Accurately Do Large Language Models Understand Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04372v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric. Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 600,010 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs. We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 78% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently Under Review.

| **[CodeEditorBench: Evaluating Code Editing Capability of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03543v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) for code are rapidly evolving, with code editing emerging as a critical capability. We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Studying the Impact of Early Test Termination Due to Assertion Failure on Code Coverage and Spectrum-based Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04557v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An assertion is commonly used to validate the expected programs behavior (e.g., if the returned value of a method equals an expected value) in software testing. Although it is a recommended practice to use only one assertion in a single test to avoid code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette), it is common to have multiple assertions in a single test. One issue with tests that have multiple assertions is that when the test fails at an early assertion (not the last one), the test will terminate at that point, and the remaining testing code will not be executed. This, in turn, can potentially reduce the code coverage and the performance of techniques that rely on code coverage information (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization). We refer to such a scenario as early test termination. Understanding the impact of early test termination on test coverage is important for software testing and debugging, particularly for the techniques that rely on coverage information obtained from the testing. We conducted the first empirical study on early test termination due to assertion failure (i.e., early test termination) by investigating 207 versions of 6 open-source projects. We found that a nonnegligible portion of the failed tests (19.1%) is early terminated due to assertion failure. Our findings indicate that early test termination harms both code coverage and the effectiveness of spectrum-based fault localization. For instance, after eliminating early test termination, the line/branch coverage is improved in 55% of the studied versions, and improves the performance of two popular SBFL techniques Ochiai and Tarantula by 15.1% and 10.7% compared to the original setting (without eliminating early test termination) in terms of MFR, respectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[Understanding API Usage and Testing: An Empirical Study of C Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11598v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For library developers, understanding how their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are used in the field can be invaluable. Knowing how clients are using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug reports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of a bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API is used. In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage across 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a combined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how well library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for library developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API usage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that library developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use their API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a popular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by the library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be leveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7% with the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the APIs are used in the field. For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be used to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce various metrics useful to library developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, 17 to 20 June, 2025, Istanbul, Turkey</p></details> |

Specifically, the realism of results obtained from students and their applicability to the software industry remains in question. In this short paper, we bring further evidence on this controversial point. To do so, we compare 62 students and 42 software professionals on a bug-fixing task on the same Java program. The students were enrolled in a Bachelor's program in Computer Science, while the professionals were employed by two multinational companies (for one of them, the professionals were from two offices). Some variations in the experimental settings of the two groups (students and professionals) were present. For instance, the experimental environment of the experiment with professionals was more realistic; i.e., they faced some stress factors such as interruptions during the bug-fixing task. Considering the differences between the two groups of participants, the gathered data show that the students outperformed the professionals in fixing bugs. This diverges to some extent from past empirical evidence. Rather than presenting definitive conclusions, our results aim to catalyze the discussion on the use of students in experiments and pave the way for future investigations. Specifically, our results encourage us to examine the complex factors influencing SE tasks, making experiments as more realistic as possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Pre-trained Large Language Models for Repairing Declarative Formal Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11050v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention as a practical research domain focused on automatically fixing bugs in programs. While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bug Classification in Quantum Software: A Rule-Based Framework and Its Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10397v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36 Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to 85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393 (quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696), category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162), suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects, while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and hardware-related issues.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |

However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |
| **[Minimizing False Positives in Static Bug Detection via LLM-Enhanced Path Feasibility Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10322v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality. However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning, LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% - 105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true positives.</p></details> |  |
| **[A First Look at Bugs in LLM Inference Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09713v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-specific inference engines (in short as \emph{LLM inference engines}) have become a fundamental component of modern AI infrastructure, enabling the deployment of LLM-powered applications (LLM apps) across cloud and local devices. Despite their critical role, LLM inference engines are prone to bugs due to the immense resource demands of LLMs and the complexities of cross-platform compatibility. However, a systematic understanding of these bugs remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first empirical study on bugs in LLM inference engines. We mine official repositories of 5 widely adopted LLM inference engines, constructing a comprehensive dataset of 929 real-world bugs. Through a rigorous open coding process, we analyze these bugs to uncover their symptoms, root causes, and commonality. Our findings reveal six major bug symptoms and a taxonomy of 28 root causes, shedding light on the key challenges in bug detection and location within LLM inference engines. Based on these insights, we propose a series of actionable implications for researchers, inference engine vendors, and LLM app developers.</p></details> | Under review |

However, many existing methods rely solely on single-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to simultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection (AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the lack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to insufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose TrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully leveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing pipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities, comprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems from both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative reasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle multiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong interpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two popular microservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that TrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%), FT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |

Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://livecodebenchpro.com/</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on LLM-Based Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02509v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern code completion engines, powered by large language models (LLMs), assist millions of developers with their strong capabilities to generate functionally correct code. Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |

Vulnerability repair investigates how to fix software vulnerabilities. Manual vulnerability repair is labor-intensive and time-consuming because it relies on human experts, highlighting the importance of Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR). In this SoK, we present the systematization of AVR methods through the three steps of AVR workflow: vulnerability analysis, patch generation, and patch validation. We assess AVR tools for C/C++ and Java programs as they have been widely studied by the community. Since existing AVR tools for C/C++ programs are evaluated with different datasets, which often consist of a few vulnerabilities, we construct the first C/C++ vulnerability repair benchmark dataset, dubbed Vul4C, which contains 144 vulnerabilities as well as their exploits and patches. We use Vul4C to evaluate seven AVR tools for C/C++ programs and use the third-party Vul4J dataset to evaluate two AVR tools for Java programs. We also discuss future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The full version of "SoK: Automated Vulnerability Repair: Methods, Tools, and Assessments" accepted by the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[KEENHash: Hashing Programs into Function-Aware Embeddings for Large-Scale Binary Code Similarity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11612v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding API Usage and Testing: An Empirical Study of C Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11598v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For library developers, understanding how their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are used in the field can be invaluable. Knowing how clients are using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug reports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of a bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API is used. In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage across 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a combined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how well library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for library developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API usage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that library developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use their API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a popular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by the library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be leveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7% with the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the APIs are used in the field. For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be used to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce various metrics useful to library developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, 17 to 20 June, 2025, Istanbul, Turkey</p></details> |
| **[Further Evidence on a Controversial Topic about Human-Based Experiments: Professionals vs. Students](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11597v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Software Engineering (SE) human-based controlled experiments rely on students as participants, raising concerns about their external validity. Specifically, the realism of results obtained from students and their applicability to the software industry remains in question. In this short paper, we bring further evidence on this controversial point. To do so, we compare 62 students and 42 software professionals on a bug-fixing task on the same Java program. The students were enrolled in a Bachelor's program in Computer Science, while the professionals were employed by two multinational companies (for one of them, the professionals were from two offices). Some variations in the experimental settings of the two groups (students and professionals) were present. For instance, the experimental environment of the experiment with professionals was more realistic; i.e., they faced some stress factors such as interruptions during the bug-fixing task. Considering the differences between the two groups of participants, the gathered data show that the students outperformed the professionals in fixing bugs. This diverges to some extent from past empirical evidence. Rather than presenting definitive conclusions, our results aim to catalyze the discussion on the use of students in experiments and pave the way for future investigations. Specifically, our results encourage us to examine the complex factors influencing SE tasks, making experiments as more realistic as possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[MBSR at Work: Perspectives from an Instructor and Software Developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11588v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the preliminary findings from a qualitative study (i.e., semi-structured interviews) on how a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, carried out in the Software Development (SD) working context, is perceived by the software developers of a multinational company who participated in the MBSR program and by the instructor who led it. MBSR is a deeply personal and experiential practice in helping individuals manage stress, particularly in high-pressure environments such as workplaces, healthcare settings, education, and other demanding professional or personal situations. Although MBSR has been experimented in different working contexts; surprisingly, it has never been studied in the SD working context where there are several stress factors that developers experience (e.g., time pressure and uncertainty about the content of a particular task and its outcome). In this respect, qualitative research can generate valuable insights into the application of MBSR in the SD working context that cannot be captured by standardized quantitative measures. Being MBSR instructors and software developers the key stakeholders in delivering an MBSR program in the SD working context, understanding their first-hand experiences can provide a more detailed picture of the investigated phenomenon. The most important takeaway result of our research can be summarized as follows: despite initial skepticism, the developers recognized personal improvements due to the MBSR practice, though the integration of MBSR techniques in the working context remained challenging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Helpful Context for LLM-based Vulnerability Repair: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11561v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42 vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's automated testing framework. Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4 with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26 (62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline (40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Do Large Language Models Serve as End-to-End Secure Code Agents for Python?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10495v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

The lack of interoperability between these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SPLASH 2025</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Pre-trained Large Language Models for Repairing Declarative Formal Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11050v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention as a practical research domain focused on automatically fixing bugs in programs. While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptiveLLM: A Framework for Selecting Optimal Cost-Efficient LLM for Code-Generation Based on CoT Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10525v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Internetware 2025</p></details> |

Although recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory. It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition, synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Variability Effects On LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10204v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models (LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier (e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model (ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, code released here: https://github.com/SprocketLab/orm-code-verifier</p></details> |

There are also a few empirical studies that have examined the hypothesis, either explicitly or implicitly. The present work continues with and contributes to this research with a replication-motivated large-scale analysis of software written in the PHP programming language. The dataset examined contains nearly four hundred thousand open source software packages written in PHP. According to the results based on reported security vulnerabilities, the hypothesis does holds; packages having been affected by vulnerabilities over their release histories are generally more popular than packages without having been affected by a single vulnerability. With this replication results, the paper contributes to the efforts to strengthen the empirical knowledge base in cyber and software security.</p></details> | Resubmitted |
| **[The Effects of GitHub Copilot on Computing Students' Programming Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Processes in Brownfield Programming Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10051v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05) and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p < 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results and analysis are presented at https://ghcopilot-icer.github.io/.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |

Yet, the inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation. Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

| **[Automated Synthesis of Formally Verified Multi-Abstraction Function Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09550v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function summaries, which characterize the behavior of code segments (typically functions) through preconditions and postconditions, are essential for understanding, reusing, and verifying software, particularly in safety-critical domains like aerospace embedded systems. However, these mission-critical legacy code serving as a valuable reused asset often lacks formal specifications. It is challenging to automatically generate function summaries for C programs, due to the existence of complex features such as loops, nested function calls, pointer aliasing, and so on. Moreover, function summaries should support multiple abstraction levels to meet diverse requirements, e.g. precise summaries capturing full functionality for formal verification and intuitive summaries for human understanding. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel framework that combines symbolic execution, large language models (LLMs), and formal verification to generate Relatively Strongest Postconditions (RSPs) and build function summaries that fully capture program behavior. Our approach leverages VST-A's symbolic execution to precisely track program execution paths and state transitions, employs LLMs to infer loop invariants based on predefined templates, and uses Frama-C to guarantee soundness of generated summaries in an iterative refinement loop. Furthermore, from generated RSPs, we automatically synthesize strongest non-redundant postconditions expressed within given domain specific language. We compare our approach with existing work through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation using large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the choice of tokens during decoding, especially at points of uncertainty that critically affect the generated program's logic. Conventional decoding methods such as greedy search and beam search apply uniform treatment to all tokens, neglecting the unique uncertainty characteristics inherent in code generation, which can result in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis demonstrating that a significant portion of generation errors arises from incorrect token ranking at high-uncertainty steps, where the ground truth token exists in the candidate set but fails to be ranked first. Inspired by this insight, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework guided by token-level uncertainty quantified via Shannon entropy. AdaDec dynamically learns uncertainty thresholds tailored to each model and employs a pause-then-rerank mechanism with lookahead when the uncertainty surpasses these thresholds. Evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks reveals that AdaDec achieves up to a 15.5% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy compared to greedy decoding, matches or outperforms traditional beam search, and reduces both computational overhead and latency through targeted, selective pausing. Our findings suggest that uncertainty-aware adaptive decoding holds considerable potential for enhancing both the reliability and efficiency of code generation with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Rust Unit Test Coverage through Hybrid Program Analysis and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09002v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for ensuring software reliability and correctness. Classic Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human effort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software testing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[RocketPPA: Code-Level Power, Performance, and Area Prediction via LLM and Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21971v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents RocketPPA, a novel ultra-fast power, performance (delay), and area (PPA) estimator operating directly at the code-level abstraction using HDL code as input. The key technical innovation is its LLM-based regression model, which uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture composed of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The LLM interprets the input HDL code and then utilizes its final hidden-layer representations to predict PPA metrics. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable efficient LLM training. Furthermore, the work includes the development of an LLM-based HDL code repair framework to generate a large and synthesizable training dataset. Experimental results on the VerilogEval benchmark demonstrate that RocketPPA achieves significant improvements in the accuracy of PPA estimation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like Llama3-MetRex-8B. Specifically, at a 10% relative error threshold, RocketPPA enhances the pass rate for area prediction by 13.6%, delay by 9.4%, and power by 14.7%. At a 20% threshold, the improvements are 9.6% for area, 10.8% for delay, and 18.5% for power. Moreover, RocketPPA achieves a speedup of over 20x compared to MetRex and 30x over MasterRTL in processing the test set. The impact of RocketPPA is the potential to substantially accelerate the hardware design process by providing accurate PPA estimations early in the design cycle, thus avoiding the overhead of manual feature engineering and time-consuming synthesis flows.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClassInvGen: Class Invariant Synthesis using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18917v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal program specifications in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants have several benefits for the construction and maintenance of programs. They not only aid in program understanding due to their unambiguous semantics but can also be enforced dynamically (or even statically when the language supports a formal verifier). However, synthesizing high-quality specifications in an underlying programming language is limited by the expressivity of the specifications or the need to express them in a declarative manner. Prior work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing high-quality method pre/postconditions for Python and Java, but does not consider class invariants. In this work, we describe ClassInvGen, a method for co-generating executable class invariants and test inputs to produce high-quality class invariants for a mainstream language such as C++, leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize pure functions. We show that ClassInvGen outperforms a pure LLM-based technique to generate specifications (from code) as well as prior data-driven invariant inference techniques such as Daikon. We contribute a benchmark of standard C++ data structures along with a harness that can help measure both the correctness and completeness of generated specifications using tests and mutants. We also demonstrate its applicability to real-world code by performing a case study on several classes within a widely used and high-integrity C++ codebase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>JEL C...</summary><p>JEL Classification: O31, C88, J24, O35, L86</p></details> |

Traditional taint analysis can track such bytes white-box, but suffers from scalability issue. Fuzzing-Driven Taint Inference (FTI) offers a black-box alternative, yet typically incurs significant runtime overhead due to extra program executions. We observe that the commonly used havoc mutation scheme in fuzzing can be adapted for lightweight FTI with zero extra executions. We present a computational model of havoc mode, demonstrating that it can perform FTI while generating new test cases. Building on this, we propose ZTaint-Havoc, a novel, efficient FTI with minimal overhead (3.84% on UniBench, 12.58% on FuzzBench). We further design an effective mutation algorithm utilizing the identified hot bytes. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that ZTaint-Havoc, implemented in AFL++, improves edge coverage by up to 33.71% on FuzzBench and 51.12% on UniBench over vanilla AFL++, with average gains of 2.97% and 6.12% in 24-hour fuzzing campaigns.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on 34th ISSTA</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Evidence-Based Beliefs of LLM-Based Programming Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13900v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), primarily powered by large language models (LLMs), have transformed how programmers develop and maintain software -- leading to new frontiers in software engineering (SE). The advanced capabilities of LLM-based programming assistants to support software development tasks have led to a rise in the adoption of LLMs in SE. However, little is known about the evidenced-based practices, tools and processes verified by research findings, supported and adopted by AI programming assistants. To this end, our work conducts a preliminary evaluation exploring the beliefs of LLM used to support software development tasks. We investigate 17 evidence-based claims posited by empirical SE research across five LLM-based programming assistants. Our findings show that LLM-based programming assistants have ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims and lack credible evidence to support responses. Based on our results, we provide implications for practitioners adopting LLM-based programming assistants in development contexts and shed light on future research directions to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs -- aiming to increase awareness and adoption of evidence-based SE research findings in practice.</p></details> |  |

Integrating advanced modelling techniques with large language models (LLMs) and formal verification in a logical style can significantly enhance this process. We propose a comprehensive framework that focuses on specific Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams for preliminary system development. This framework offers visualisations at various modelling stages and seamlessly integrates large language models and logical reasoning engines. The behavioural models generated with the assistance of LLMs are automatically translated into formal logical specifications. Deductive formal verification ensures that logical requirements and interrelations between software artefacts are thoroughly addressed.

These agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work, we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2) using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation -- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned with human development practices.</p></details> |  |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Worst-Case Symbolic Constraints Analysis and Generalisation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08171v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model, WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.</p></details> |  |

This extraneous generation suggests a lack of awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned \texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing, especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However, post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is a random span of code.</p></details> | Work in progress |

To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |

Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://livecodebenchpro.com/</p></details> |

Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |

The abundance of online user feedback warrants the automated identification of quality characteristics, but the online user feedback's heterogeneity and the lack of appropriate training corpora limit the applicability of supervised machine learning. We therefore investigate the viability of three approaches that could be effective in low-data settings: language patterns (LPs) based on quality-related keywords, instructions for crowdsourced micro-tasks, and large language model (LLM) prompts. We determined the feasibility of each approach and then compared their accuracy. For the complex multiclass classification of quality characteristics, the LP-based approach achieved a varied precision (0.38-0.92) depending on the quality characteristic, and low recall; crowdsourcing achieved the best average accuracy in two consecutive phases (0.63, 0.72), which could be matched by the best-performing LLM condition (0.66) and a prediction based on the LLMs' majority vote (0.68). Our findings show that in this low-data setting, the two approaches that use crowdsourcing or LLMs instead of involving experts achieve accurate classifications, while the LP-based approach has only limited potential. The promise of crowdsourcing and LLMs in this context might even extend to building training corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS); online appendix and supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15604749</p></details> |

| **[An Empirical study on LLM-based Log Retrieval for Software Engineering Metadata Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11659v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing autonomous driving systems (ADSs) involves generating and storing extensive log data from test drives, which is essential for verification, research, and simulation. However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over varying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific driving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals representing various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as unfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals. Traditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both domain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are difficult to verify for accuracy. This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that combines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling natural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for specialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap indicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of query results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database querying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for intuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates improved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating dependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Property-based Test Generation for Guardrailing Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23549v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems that integrate physical, computational, and communication subsystems. The heterogeneous nature of these systems makes their safety assurance challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach for guardrailing cyber-physical systems using property-based tests (PBTs) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs an LLM to extract properties from the code and documentation of CPSs. Next, we use the LLM to generate PBTs that verify the extracted properties on the CPS. The generated PBTs have two uses. First, they are used to test the CPS before it is deployed, i.e., at design time. Secondly, these PBTs can be used after deployment, i.e., at run time, to monitor the behavior of the system and guardrail it against unsafe states. We implement our approach in ChekProp and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the generated PBTs in terms of their relevance (how well they match manually crafted properties), executability (how many run with minimal manual modification), and effectiveness (coverage of the input space partitions). The results of our experiments and evaluation demonstrate a promising path forward for creating guardrails for CPSs using LLM-generated property-based tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[KEENHash: Hashing Programs into Function-Aware Embeddings for Large-Scale Binary Code Similarity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11612v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding API Usage and Testing: An Empirical Study of C Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11598v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For library developers, understanding how their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are used in the field can be invaluable. Knowing how clients are using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug reports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of a bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API is used. In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage across 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a combined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how well library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for library developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API usage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that library developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use their API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a popular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by the library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be leveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7% with the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the APIs are used in the field. For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be used to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce various metrics useful to library developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, 17 to 20 June, 2025, Istanbul, Turkey</p></details> |
| **[Further Evidence on a Controversial Topic about Human-Based Experiments: Professionals vs. Students](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11597v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Software Engineering (SE) human-based controlled experiments rely on students as participants, raising concerns about their external validity. Specifically, the realism of results obtained from students and their applicability to the software industry remains in question. In this short paper, we bring further evidence on this controversial point. To do so, we compare 62 students and 42 software professionals on a bug-fixing task on the same Java program. The students were enrolled in a Bachelor's program in Computer Science, while the professionals were employed by two multinational companies (for one of them, the professionals were from two offices). Some variations in the experimental settings of the two groups (students and professionals) were present. For instance, the experimental environment of the experiment with professionals was more realistic; i.e., they faced some stress factors such as interruptions during the bug-fixing task. Considering the differences between the two groups of participants, the gathered data show that the students outperformed the professionals in fixing bugs. This diverges to some extent from past empirical evidence. Rather than presenting definitive conclusions, our results aim to catalyze the discussion on the use of students in experiments and pave the way for future investigations. Specifically, our results encourage us to examine the complex factors influencing SE tasks, making experiments as more realistic as possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Review Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11591v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code review comment generation (RCG) aims to assist developers by automatically producing natural language feedback for code changes. Existing approaches are primarily either generation-based, using pretrained language models, or information retrieval-based (IR), reusing comments from similar past examples. While generation-based methods leverage code-specific pretraining on large code-natural language corpora to learn semantic relationships between code and natural language, they often struggle to generate low-frequency but semantically important tokens due to their probabilistic nature. In contrast, IR-based methods excel at recovering such rare tokens by copying from existing examples but lack flexibility in adapting to new code contexts-for example, when input code contains identifiers or structures not found in the retrieval database. To bridge the gap between generation-based and IR-based methods, this work proposes to leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for RCG by conditioning pretrained language models on retrieved code-review exemplars. By providing relevant examples that illustrate how similar code has been previously reviewed, the model is better guided to generate accurate review comments. Our evaluation on the Tufano et al. benchmark shows that RAG-based RCG outperforms both generation-based and IR-based RCG. It achieves up to +1.67% higher exact match and +4.25% higher BLEU scores compared to generation-based RCG. It also improves the generation of low-frequency ground-truth tokens by up to 24.01%. We additionally find that performance improves as the number of retrieved exemplars increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[MBSR at Work: Perspectives from an Instructor and Software Developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11588v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the preliminary findings from a qualitative study (i.e., semi-structured interviews) on how a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, carried out in the Software Development (SD) working context, is perceived by the software developers of a multinational company who participated in the MBSR program and by the instructor who led it. MBSR is a deeply personal and experiential practice in helping individuals manage stress, particularly in high-pressure environments such as workplaces, healthcare settings, education, and other demanding professional or personal situations. Although MBSR has been experimented in different working contexts; surprisingly, it has never been studied in the SD working context where there are several stress factors that developers experience (e.g., time pressure and uncertainty about the content of a particular task and its outcome). In this respect, qualitative research can generate valuable insights into the application of MBSR in the SD working context that cannot be captured by standardized quantitative measures. Being MBSR instructors and software developers the key stakeholders in delivering an MBSR program in the SD working context, understanding their first-hand experiences can provide a more detailed picture of the investigated phenomenon. The most important takeaway result of our research can be summarized as follows: despite initial skepticism, the developers recognized personal improvements due to the MBSR practice, though the integration of MBSR techniques in the working context remained challenging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Helpful Context for LLM-based Vulnerability Repair: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11561v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42 vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's automated testing framework. Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4 with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26 (62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline (40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11559v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests with relatively minimal manual effort. Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4 can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant role in a partially automated process.</p></details> |  |

However, their applications to broader SE practices including conceptualization, design, and other non-code tasks, remain partially underexplored. This research aims to augment the generality and performance of LLMs for SE by (1) advancing the understanding of how LLMs with different characteristics perform on various non-code tasks, (2) evaluating them as sources of foundational knowledge in SE, and (3) effectively detecting hallucinations on SE statements. The expected contributions include a variety of LLMs trained and evaluated on domain-specific datasets, new benchmarks on foundational knowledge in SE, and methods for detecting hallucinations. Initial results in terms of performance improvements on various non-code tasks are promising.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Procedural Framework for Assessing the Desirability of Process Deviations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11525v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformance checking techniques help process analysts to identify where and how process executions deviate from a process model. However, they cannot determine the desirability of these deviations, i.e., whether they are problematic, acceptable or even beneficial for the process. Such desirability assessments are crucial to derive actions, but process analysts typically conduct them in a manual, ad-hoc way, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and irreplicable. To address this problem, this paper presents a procedural framework to guide process analysts in systematically assessing deviation desirability. It provides a step-by-step approach for identifying which input factors to consider in what order to categorize deviations into mutually exclusive desirability categories, each linked to action recommendations. The framework is based on a review and conceptualization of existing literature on deviation desirability, which is complemented by empirical insights from interviews with process analysis practitioners and researchers. We evaluate the framework through a desirability assessment task conducted with practitioners, indicating that the framework effectively enables them to streamline the assessment for a thorough yet concise evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VulStamp: Vulnerability Assessment using Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11484v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern vulnerability detection tools enable developers to efficiently identify numerous security flaws, indiscriminate remediation efforts often lead to superfluous development expenses. This is particularly true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency. Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types, VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to train the assessment model.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Do Large Language Models Serve as End-to-End Secure Code Agents for Python?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10495v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[VulScribeR: Exploring RAG-based Vulnerability Augmentation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04125v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting vulnerabilities is vital for software security, yet deep learning-based vulnerability detectors (DLVD) face a data shortage, which limits their effectiveness. Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of 497,742 issues mined from 1,209 open-source blockchain projects hosted on GitHub. Employing BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, we identify 49 distinct issue topics and organize them hierarchically into 11 major subcategories. Our analysis reveals that both general software development issues and blockchain-specific concerns are nearly equally represented, with Wallet Management and UI Enhancement emerging as the most prominent topics. We further examine the temporal evolution of issue categories and resolution times, finding that Wallet issues not only dominate in frequency but also exhibit the longest resolution time. Conversely, Mechanisms issues are resolved significantly faster. Issue frequency surged after 2016 with the rise of Ethereum and decentralized applications, but declined after 2022. These findings enhance our understanding of blockchain software maintenance, informing the development of specialized tools and practices to improve robustness and maintainability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification, leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |

Using practical examples, including the marker-based autonomous landing system, we demonstrate how to systematically verify drone system behaviors, identify integration issues, and optimize performance. Furthermore, we highlight emerging trends shaping the future of drone testing, including the integration of Neurosymbolic and LLMs, creating co-simulation environments, and Digital Twin-enabled simulation-based testing techniques. By following this pipeline, developers and researchers can achieve comprehensive validation, minimize deployment risks, and prepare autonomous drones for safe and reliable real-world operations.</p></details> |  |

In enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL (Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+32...</summary><p>10+32 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2) execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy) for automatic code refinement.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[On Mutation-Guided Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02954v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software. While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Cure: LLM-based Competitor User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15724v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

As CPS grow in complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software, and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for automated and comparative evaluation. Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly compose systems or integrate components across platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed, component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Non-Code Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10833v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code understanding and generation; however, their effectiveness on non-code Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Package Management via Hypergraph Dependency Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10803v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Package managers are everywhere, with seemingly every language and operating system implementing their own solution. The lack of interoperability between these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SPLASH 2025</p></details> |

However, how users perceive, evaluate, and critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with 894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies. Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes: positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g., scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained, co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis. To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Tea Leaves to System Maps: Context-awareness in Monitoring Operational Machine Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10770v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) models in production do not fail due to statistical anomalies in their input data; they fail due to contextual misalignment -- when their environment deviates from training assumptions, leading to unreliable predictions. Effective ML monitoring requires rich contextual information to move beyond detecting statistical shifts toward meaningful alerts and systematic root-cause analysis. Yet, surprisingly, despite extensive research in ML monitoring and related disciplines (drift detection, data validation, out-of-distribution detection), there is no shared understanding of how to use contextual information -- striking, given that monitoring involves interpretation of information in context. In response, this paper presents a systematic review to characterize and structure the various types of contextual information in this domain. Our analysis examines 94 primary studies across data mining, databases, software engineering, and ML. We introduce the Contextual System--Aspect--Representation (C-SAR) framework, a conceptual model that synthesizes our findings. We also identify 20 recurring and potentially reusable patterns of specific system, aspect, and representation combinations, and map them to the monitoring activities they support. This study provides a new perspective on ML monitoring: from interpreting "tea leaves" of observational statistics into constructing and managing "system maps" that enable systematic and reliable ML monitoring practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Pre-trained Large Language Models for Repairing Declarative Formal Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11050v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention as a practical research domain focused on automatically fixing bugs in programs. While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

In this work-in-progress paper, we present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system, where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven production systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not One to Rule Them All: Mining Meaningful Code Review Orders From GitHub](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10654v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers use tools such as GitHub pull requests to review code, discuss proposed changes, and request modifications. While changed files are commonly presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100 popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for 44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order. Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests, where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than following a single predefined order.</p></details> |  |

However, the availability of hardware often lags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this, Virtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a pivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified target software. In this study, we propose an approach leveraging containerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies and enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as open-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat licenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study. Through our research, we offer a robust solution to address the challenges posed by the complexity of HW/SW systems, with practical implications for accelerating HW/SW co-development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in DVCon China 2025</p></details> |

Ensuring resilience usually demands fault-injection experiments in production-like setups. We propose \textit{model discovery} -- an automated CI/CD step that extracts a live dependency graph from trace data -- and show that this lightweight representation is sufficient for accurate resilience prediction. Using the DeathStarBench Social Network, we build the graph, simulate failures via Monte-Carlo, and run matching chaos experiments on the real system. The graph model closely matches reality: with no replication, 16 trials yield an observed resilience of 0.186 versus a predicted 0.161; with replication, both observed and predicted values converge to 0.305 (mean absolute error \leq 0.0004). These results indicate that even a simple, automatically discovered graph can estimate microservice availability with high fidelity, offering rapid design-time insight without full-scale failure testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptiveLLM: A Framework for Selecting Optimal Cost-Efficient LLM for Code-Generation Based on CoT Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10525v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Internetware 2025</p></details> |

Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.

| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXPEREPAIR: Dual-Memory Enhanced LLM-based Repository-Level Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10484v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically repairing software issues remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of software engineering and AI. Although recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory. It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition, synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Network Methods for Hub-like Microservice Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07683v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Microservice Architecture is a popular architectural paradigm that facilitates flexibility by decomposing applications into small, independently deployable services. Catalogs of architectural anti-patterns have been proposed to highlight the negative aspects of flawed microservice design. In particular, the Hub-like anti-pattern lacks an unambiguous definition and detection method. Aim: In this work, we aim to find a robust detection approach for the Hub-like microservice anti-pattern that outputs a reasonable number of Hub-like candidates with high precision. Method: We leveraged a dataset of 25 microservice networks and several network hub detection techniques to identify the Hub-like anti-pattern, namely scale-free property, centrality metrics and clustering coefficient, minimum description length principle, and the approach behind the Arcan tool. Results and Conclusion: Our findings revealed that the studied architectural networks are not scale-free, that most considered hub detection approaches do not agree on the detected hubs, and that the method by Kirkley leveraging the Erdos-Renyi encoding is the most accurate one in terms of the number of detected hubs and the detection precision. Investigating further the applicability of these methods to detecting Hub-like components in microservice-based and other systems opens up new research directions. Moreover, our results provide an evaluation of the approach utilized by the widely used Arcan tool and highlight the potential to update the tool to use the normalized degree centrality of a component in the network, or for the approach based on ER encoding to be adopted instead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Centrality Change Proneness: an Early Indicator of Microservice Architectural Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07690v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, the wide adoption of Microservice Architecture has required the identification of various patterns and anti-patterns to prevent Microservice Architectural Degradation. Frequently, the systems are modelled as a network of connected services. Recently, the study of temporal networks has emerged as a way to describe and analyze evolving networks. Previous research has explored how software metrics such as size, complexity, and quality are related to microservice centrality in the architectural network. This study investigates whether temporal centrality metrics can provide insight into the early detection of architectural degradation by correlating or affecting software metrics. We reconstructed the architecture of 7 releases of an OSS microservice project with 42 services. For every service in every release, we computed the software and centrality metrics. From one of the latter, we derived a new metric, Centrality Change Proneness. We then explored the correlation between the metrics. We identified 7 size and 5 complexity metrics that have a consistent correlation with centrality, while Centrality Change Proneness did not affect the software metrics, thus providing yet another perspective and an early indicator of microservice architectural degradation.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36 Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to 85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393 (quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696), category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162), suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects, while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and hardware-related issues.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MLLM-Based UI2Code Automation Guided by UI Layout Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10376v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task; however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches.

This study presents AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24 state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose, reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types, model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeTool: Enhancing Programmatic Tool Invocation of LLMs via Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20840v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool invocation significantly enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet challenges persist, particularly in complex task scenarios. Current methods, such as instruction-enhanced reasoning and supervised fine-tuning, often result in unnecessarily long reasoning paths and face difficulties in verifying the correctness of intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose CodeTool, a novel framework for stepwise code generation that improves LLM tool invocation by leveraging the concise and easily verifiable nature of code. CodeTool incorporates two distinct process rewards: the On-the-spot Reward, which provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of each tool invocation, and the Latent Reward, which assesses the contribution of each step toward overall task completion. By maximizing the cumulative reward of the On-the-spot and Latend Rewards at each step, LLMs are guided to follow efficient and accurate reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench-TMDB demonstrate the superiority of CodeTool over existing approaches.</p></details> | ACL2025 |
| **[Augmenting Large Language Models with Static Code Analysis for Automated Code Quality Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10330v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |
| **[ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10323v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |
| **[Minimizing False Positives in Static Bug Detection via LLM-Enhanced Path Feasibility Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10322v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality. However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning, LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% - 105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true positives.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a systematic review of software vulnerability detection (SVD) research from 2018 to 2023, offering a comprehensive taxonomy of techniques, feature representations, and embedding methods. Our analysis reveals that 91% of studies use AI-based methods, with graph-based models being the most prevalent. We identify key limitations, including dataset quality, reproducibility, and interpretability, and highlight emerging opportunities in underexplored techniques such as federated learning and quantum neural networks, providing a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |

We report a usability trial with 7 experienced Seccomp developers exploring how they approached sandboxing an application and the difficulties they faced. The developers each approached sandboxing the application differently and each came to different solutions. We highlight many challenges of using Seccomp, the sandboxing designs by the participants, and what developers think would make it easier for them to sandbox applications effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Variability Effects On LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10204v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Fault Domains for Conformance Testing of Finite State Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19405v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fault domain reflects a tester's assumptions about faults that may occur in an implementation and that need to be detected during testing. A fault domain that has been widely studied in the literature on black-box conformance testing is the class of finite state machines (FSMs) with at most $m$ states. Numerous strategies for generating test suites have been proposed that guarantee fault coverage for this class. These so-called $m$-complete test suites grow exponentially in $m-n$, where $n$ is the number of states of the specification, so one can only run them for small values of $m-n$. But the assumption that $m-n$ is small is not realistic in practice. In his seminal paper from 1964, Hennie raised the challenge to design checking experiments in which the number of states may increase appreciably. In order to solve this long-standing open problem, we propose (much larger) fault domains that capture the assumption that all states in an implementation can be reached by first performing a sequence from some set $A$ (typically a state cover for the specification), followed by $k$ arbitrary inputs, for some small $k$. The number of states of FSMs in these fault domains grows exponentially in $k$. We present a sufficient condition for $k$-$A$-completeness of test suites with respect to these fault domains. Our condition implies $k$-$A$-completeness of two prominent $m$-complete test suite generation strategies, the Wp and HSI methods. Thus these strategies are complete for much larger fault domains than those for which they were originally designed, and thereby solve Hennie's challenge. We show that three other prominent $m$-complete methods (H, SPY and SPYH) do not always generate $k$-$A$-complete test suites.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 11 figures, to appear in proceedings CONCUR 2025</p></details> |
| **[D-LiFT: Improving LLM-based Decompiler Backend via Code Quality-driven Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10125v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances, their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}. Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle, D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically, D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-SCORE.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However, challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models (LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier (e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model (ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, code released here: https://github.com/SprocketLab/orm-code-verifier</p></details> |

This literature review explores how modern event-driven and microservices-based architectures, particularly those leveraging Apache Kafka, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Kubernetes are transforming retail and financial systems. By systematically reviewing academic publications, technical white papers, and industry reports from recent years, this study synthesizes key themes and implementation strategies. The analysis reveals that technologies like Kafka and Spring Boot are instrumental in building low-latency, event-driven applications that support real-time analytics and fraud detection, while MongoDB, when deployed on Kubernetes, ensures fault tolerance and high availability in inventory and transaction systems. Kubernetes itself plays a crucial role in automating deployment and scaling of microservices. These findings provide valuable insights for industry practitioners aiming to design scalable infrastructures, identify research opportunities in hybrid deployment models, and offer educators a foundation to integrate modern system architectures into professional and technical communication training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing a Safety Case: Bottom-up Guidance for Claims and Evidence Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09929v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Automated Driving Systems (ADS) technology advances, ensuring safety and public trust requires robust assurance frameworks, with safety cases emerging as a critical tool toward such a goal. This paper explores an approach to assess how a safety case is supported by its claims and evidence, toward establishing credibility for the overall case. Starting from a description of the building blocks of a safety case (claims, evidence, and optional format-dependent entries), this paper delves into the assessment of support of each claim through the provided evidence. Two domains of assessment are outlined for each claim: procedural support (formalizing process specification) and implementation support (demonstrating process application). Additionally, an assessment of evidence status is also undertaken, independently from the claims support. Scoring strategies and evaluation guidelines are provided, including detailed scoring tables for claim support and evidence status assessment. The paper further discusses governance, continual improvement, and timing considerations for safety case assessments. Reporting of results and findings is contextualized within its primary use for internal decision-making on continual improvement efforts. The presented approach builds on state of the art auditing practices, but specifically tackles the question of judging the credibility of a safety case. While not conclusive on its own, it provides a starting point toward a comprehensive "Case Credibility Assessment" (CCA), starting from the evaluation of the support for each claim (individually and in aggregate), as well as every piece of evidence provided. By delving into the technical intricacies of ADS safety cases, this work contributes to the ongoing discourse on safety assurance and aims to facilitate the responsible integration of ADS technology into society.</p></details> |  |

There are also a few empirical studies that have examined the hypothesis, either explicitly or implicitly. The present work continues with and contributes to this research with a replication-motivated large-scale analysis of software written in the PHP programming language. The dataset examined contains nearly four hundred thousand open source software packages written in PHP. According to the results based on reported security vulnerabilities, the hypothesis does holds; packages having been affected by vulnerabilities over their release histories are generally more popular than packages without having been affected by a single vulnerability. With this replication results, the paper contributes to the efforts to strengthen the empirical knowledge base in cyber and software security.</p></details> | Resubmitted |

Quantum can complement classical resources for specific workloads, but their adoption depends on integration into existing HPC infrastructure. Treating quantum devices as first-class resources allows for unified scheduling, improved usability, and support for hybrid quantum-classical applications. This paper presents the design architecture and reference implementation for quantum resources control using existing workload management systems. We introduce a suite of plugins for Slurm that enable integration of on-prem and cloud quantum computing resources into existing high-performance computing centers. The paper details the interface design, plugin concept and implementation, operational aspects for heterogeneous compute clusters, as well as considerations for other resource management systems.</p></details> |  |

In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05) and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p < 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks.

At the same time, SHI is already common in commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10) with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. To address this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to advance rAI development in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2025 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency FAccT'25</p></details> |

Many approaches have been proposed to automatically discover simulation models from historical event logs, reducing the cost and time to manually design them. However, in dynamic business environments, organizations continuously refine their processes to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Existing techniques to process simulation discovery lack adaptability to real-time operational changes. In this paper, we propose a streaming process simulation discovery technique that integrates Incremental Process Discovery with Online Machine Learning methods. This technique prioritizes recent data while preserving historical information, ensuring adaptation to evolving process dynamics. Experiments conducted on four different event logs demonstrate the importance in simulation of giving more weight to recent data while retaining historical knowledge. Our technique not only produces more stable simulations but also exhibits robustness in handling concept drift, as highlighted in one of the use cases.</p></details> |  |

However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2) reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate, node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code. Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |

Yet, the inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation. Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

Despite their critical role, LLM inference engines are prone to bugs due to the immense resource demands of LLMs and the complexities of cross-platform compatibility. However, a systematic understanding of these bugs remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first empirical study on bugs in LLM inference engines. We mine official repositories of 5 widely adopted LLM inference engines, constructing a comprehensive dataset of 929 real-world bugs. Through a rigorous open coding process, we analyze these bugs to uncover their symptoms, root causes, and commonality. Our findings reveal six major bug symptoms and a taxonomy of 28 root causes, shedding light on the key challenges in bug detection and location within LLM inference engines. Based on these insights, we propose a series of actionable implications for researchers, inference engine vendors, and LLM app developers.</p></details> | Under review |

Manual analysis of NVD references showed Git references enable over 86% success, while non-Git references achieve under 14%. Using these findings, we built an automated pipeline extracting 31,942 VFCs from 20,360 NVD records (8.7% of 235,341) with 87% precision, mainly from Git references. To fill gaps, we mined six external security databases, yielding 29,254 VFCs for 18,985 records (8.1%) at 88.4% precision, and GitHub repositories, adding 3,686 VFCs for 2,795 records (1.2%) at 73% precision. Combining these, we mapped 26,710 unique records (11.3% coverage) from 7,634 projects, with overlap between NVD and external databases, plus unique GitHub contributions. Despite success with Git references, 88.7% of records remain unmapped, highlighting the difficulty without Git links. This study offers insights for enhancing vulnerability datasets and guiding future automated security research.</p></details> |  |

Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |

The abundance of online user feedback warrants the automated identification of quality characteristics, but the online user feedback's heterogeneity and the lack of appropriate training corpora limit the applicability of supervised machine learning. We therefore investigate the viability of three approaches that could be effective in low-data settings: language patterns (LPs) based on quality-related keywords, instructions for crowdsourced micro-tasks, and large language model (LLM) prompts. We determined the feasibility of each approach and then compared their accuracy. For the complex multiclass classification of quality characteristics, the LP-based approach achieved a varied precision (0.38-0.92) depending on the quality characteristic, and low recall; crowdsourcing achieved the best average accuracy in two consecutive phases (0.63, 0.72), which could be matched by the best-performing LLM condition (0.66) and a prediction based on the LLMs' majority vote (0.68). Our findings show that in this low-data setting, the two approaches that use crowdsourcing or LLMs instead of involving experts achieve accurate classifications, while the LP-based approach has only limited potential. The promise of crowdsourcing and LLMs in this context might even extend to building training corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS); online appendix and supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15604749</p></details> |

Vulnerability repair investigates how to fix software vulnerabilities. Manual vulnerability repair is labor-intensive and time-consuming because it relies on human experts, highlighting the importance of Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR). In this SoK, we present the systematization of AVR methods through the three steps of AVR workflow: vulnerability analysis, patch generation, and patch validation. We assess AVR tools for C/C++ and Java programs as they have been widely studied by the community. Since existing AVR tools for C/C++ programs are evaluated with different datasets, which often consist of a few vulnerabilities, we construct the first C/C++ vulnerability repair benchmark dataset, dubbed Vul4C, which contains 144 vulnerabilities as well as their exploits and patches. We use Vul4C to evaluate seven AVR tools for C/C++ programs and use the third-party Vul4J dataset to evaluate two AVR tools for Java programs. We also discuss future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The full version of "SoK: Automated Vulnerability Repair: Methods, Tools, and Assessments" accepted by the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2025)</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical study on LLM-based Log Retrieval for Software Engineering Metadata Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11659v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing autonomous driving systems (ADSs) involves generating and storing extensive log data from test drives, which is essential for verification, research, and simulation. However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over varying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific driving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals representing various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as unfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals. Traditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both domain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are difficult to verify for accuracy. This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that combines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling natural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for specialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap indicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of query results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database querying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for intuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates improved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating dependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Property-based Test Generation for Guardrailing Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23549v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems that integrate physical, computational, and communication subsystems. The heterogeneous nature of these systems makes their safety assurance challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach for guardrailing cyber-physical systems using property-based tests (PBTs) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs an LLM to extract properties from the code and documentation of CPSs. Next, we use the LLM to generate PBTs that verify the extracted properties on the CPS. The generated PBTs have two uses. First, they are used to test the CPS before it is deployed, i.e., at design time. Secondly, these PBTs can be used after deployment, i.e., at run time, to monitor the behavior of the system and guardrail it against unsafe states. We implement our approach in ChekProp and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the generated PBTs in terms of their relevance (how well they match manually crafted properties), executability (how many run with minimal manual modification), and effectiveness (coverage of the input space partitions). The results of our experiments and evaluation demonstrate a promising path forward for creating guardrails for CPSs using LLM-generated property-based tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Understanding API Usage and Testing: An Empirical Study of C Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11598v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For library developers, understanding how their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are used in the field can be invaluable. Knowing how clients are using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug reports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of a bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API is used. In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage across 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a combined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how well library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for library developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API usage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that library developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use their API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a popular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by the library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be leveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7% with the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the APIs are used in the field. For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be used to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce various metrics useful to library developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, 17 to 20 June, 2025, Istanbul, Turkey</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Review Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11591v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code review comment generation (RCG) aims to assist developers by automatically producing natural language feedback for code changes. Existing approaches are primarily either generation-based, using pretrained language models, or information retrieval-based (IR), reusing comments from similar past examples. While generation-based methods leverage code-specific pretraining on large code-natural language corpora to learn semantic relationships between code and natural language, they often struggle to generate low-frequency but semantically important tokens due to their probabilistic nature. In contrast, IR-based methods excel at recovering such rare tokens by copying from existing examples but lack flexibility in adapting to new code contexts-for example, when input code contains identifiers or structures not found in the retrieval database. To bridge the gap between generation-based and IR-based methods, this work proposes to leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for RCG by conditioning pretrained language models on retrieved code-review exemplars. By providing relevant examples that illustrate how similar code has been previously reviewed, the model is better guided to generate accurate review comments. Our evaluation on the Tufano et al. benchmark shows that RAG-based RCG outperforms both generation-based and IR-based RCG. It achieves up to +1.67% higher exact match and +4.25% higher BLEU scores compared to generation-based RCG. It also improves the generation of low-frequency ground-truth tokens by up to 24.01%. We additionally find that performance improves as the number of retrieved exemplars increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Helpful Context for LLM-based Vulnerability Repair: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11561v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42 vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's automated testing framework. Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4 with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26 (62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline (40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11559v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests with relatively minimal manual effort. Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4 can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant role in a partially automated process.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification, leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of these systems is paramount as they transition from research prototypes to mission-critical platforms. This paper presents a step-by-step guide to establishing a robust autonomous drone testing pipeline, covering each critical stage: Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) Simulation Testing, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing, Controlled Real-World Testing, and In-Field Testing. Using practical examples, including the marker-based autonomous landing system, we demonstrate how to systematically verify drone system behaviors, identify integration issues, and optimize performance. Furthermore, we highlight emerging trends shaping the future of drone testing, including the integration of Neurosymbolic and LLMs, creating co-simulation environments, and Digital Twin-enabled simulation-based testing techniques. By following this pipeline, developers and researchers can achieve comprehensive validation, minimize deployment risks, and prepare autonomous drones for safe and reliable real-world operations.</p></details> |  |

There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2) execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy) for automatic code refinement.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[On Mutation-Guided Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02954v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software. While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

As CPS grow in complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software, and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for automated and comparative evaluation. Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly compose systems or integrate components across platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed, component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and development.</p></details> |  |

We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |

Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |

| **[Classification of Quality Characteristics in Online User Feedback using Linguistic Analysis, Crowdsourcing and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11722v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software qualities such as usability or reliability are among the strongest determinants of mobile app user satisfaction and constitute a significant portion of online user feedback on software products, making it a valuable source of quality-related feedback to guide the development process. The abundance of online user feedback warrants the automated identification of quality characteristics, but the online user feedback's heterogeneity and the lack of appropriate training corpora limit the applicability of supervised machine learning. We therefore investigate the viability of three approaches that could be effective in low-data settings: language patterns (LPs) based on quality-related keywords, instructions for crowdsourced micro-tasks, and large language model (LLM) prompts. We determined the feasibility of each approach and then compared their accuracy. For the complex multiclass classification of quality characteristics, the LP-based approach achieved a varied precision (0.38-0.92) depending on the quality characteristic, and low recall; crowdsourcing achieved the best average accuracy in two consecutive phases (0.63, 0.72), which could be matched by the best-performing LLM condition (0.66) and a prediction based on the LLMs' majority vote (0.68). Our findings show that in this low-data setting, the two approaches that use crowdsourcing or LLMs instead of involving experts achieve accurate classifications, while the LP-based approach has only limited potential. The promise of crowdsourcing and LLMs in this context might even extend to building training corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS); online appendix and supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15604749</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical study on LLM-based Log Retrieval for Software Engineering Metadata Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11659v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing autonomous driving systems (ADSs) involves generating and storing extensive log data from test drives, which is essential for verification, research, and simulation. However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over varying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific driving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals representing various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as unfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals. Traditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both domain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are difficult to verify for accuracy. This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that combines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling natural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for specialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap indicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of query results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database querying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for intuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates improved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating dependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Property-based Test Generation for Guardrailing Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23549v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems that integrate physical, computational, and communication subsystems. The heterogeneous nature of these systems makes their safety assurance challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach for guardrailing cyber-physical systems using property-based tests (PBTs) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs an LLM to extract properties from the code and documentation of CPSs. Next, we use the LLM to generate PBTs that verify the extracted properties on the CPS. The generated PBTs have two uses. First, they are used to test the CPS before it is deployed, i.e., at design time. Secondly, these PBTs can be used after deployment, i.e., at run time, to monitor the behavior of the system and guardrail it against unsafe states. We implement our approach in ChekProp and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the generated PBTs in terms of their relevance (how well they match manually crafted properties), executability (how many run with minimal manual modification), and effectiveness (coverage of the input space partitions). The results of our experiments and evaluation demonstrate a promising path forward for creating guardrails for CPSs using LLM-generated property-based tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[KEENHash: Hashing Programs into Function-Aware Embeddings for Large-Scale Binary Code Similarity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11612v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Helpful Context for LLM-based Vulnerability Repair: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11561v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42 vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's automated testing framework. Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4 with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26 (62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline (40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |

However, their applications to broader SE practices including conceptualization, design, and other non-code tasks, remain partially underexplored. This research aims to augment the generality and performance of LLMs for SE by (1) advancing the understanding of how LLMs with different characteristics perform on various non-code tasks, (2) evaluating them as sources of foundational knowledge in SE, and (3) effectively detecting hallucinations on SE statements. The expected contributions include a variety of LLMs trained and evaluated on domain-specific datasets, new benchmarks on foundational knowledge in SE, and methods for detecting hallucinations. Initial results in terms of performance improvements on various non-code tasks are promising.</p></details> |  |
| **[VulStamp: Vulnerability Assessment using Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11484v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern vulnerability detection tools enable developers to efficiently identify numerous security flaws, indiscriminate remediation efforts often lead to superfluous development expenses. This is particularly true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency. Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types, VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to train the assessment model.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Do Large Language Models Serve as End-to-End Secure Code Agents for Python?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10495v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[VulScribeR: Exploring RAG-based Vulnerability Augmentation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04125v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting vulnerabilities is vital for software security, yet deep learning-based vulnerability detectors (DLVD) face a data shortage, which limits their effectiveness. Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification, leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of these systems is paramount as they transition from research prototypes to mission-critical platforms. This paper presents a step-by-step guide to establishing a robust autonomous drone testing pipeline, covering each critical stage: Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) Simulation Testing, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing, Controlled Real-World Testing, and In-Field Testing. Using practical examples, including the marker-based autonomous landing system, we demonstrate how to systematically verify drone system behaviors, identify integration issues, and optimize performance. Furthermore, we highlight emerging trends shaping the future of drone testing, including the integration of Neurosymbolic and LLMs, creating co-simulation environments, and Digital Twin-enabled simulation-based testing techniques. By following this pipeline, developers and researchers can achieve comprehensive validation, minimize deployment risks, and prepare autonomous drones for safe and reliable real-world operations.</p></details> |  |

In enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL (Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+32...</summary><p>10+32 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

| **[Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on LLM-Based Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02509v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern code completion engines, powered by large language models (LLMs), assist millions of developers with their strong capabilities to generate functionally correct code. Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |

However, employing tools like GeoPandas, a prominent Python library for geospatial data manipulation, necessitates expertise in complex domain-specific syntax and workflows. GeoPandas-AI addresses this gap by integrating LLMs directly into the GeoPandas workflow, transforming the GeoDataFrame class into an intelligent, stateful class for both data analysis and geospatial code development. This paper formalizes the design of such a smart class and provides an open-source implementation of GeoPandas-AI in PyPI package manager. Through its innovative combination of conversational interfaces and stateful exploitation of LLMs for code generation and data analysis, GeoPandas-AI introduces a new paradigm for code-copilots and instantiates it for geospatial development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Quality Characteristics in Online User Feedback using Linguistic Analysis, Crowdsourcing and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11722v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software qualities such as usability or reliability are among the strongest determinants of mobile app user satisfaction and constitute a significant portion of online user feedback on software products, making it a valuable source of quality-related feedback to guide the development process. The abundance of online user feedback warrants the automated identification of quality characteristics, but the online user feedback's heterogeneity and the lack of appropriate training corpora limit the applicability of supervised machine learning. We therefore investigate the viability of three approaches that could be effective in low-data settings: language patterns (LPs) based on quality-related keywords, instructions for crowdsourced micro-tasks, and large language model (LLM) prompts. We determined the feasibility of each approach and then compared their accuracy. For the complex multiclass classification of quality characteristics, the LP-based approach achieved a varied precision (0.38-0.92) depending on the quality characteristic, and low recall; crowdsourcing achieved the best average accuracy in two consecutive phases (0.63, 0.72), which could be matched by the best-performing LLM condition (0.66) and a prediction based on the LLMs' majority vote (0.68). Our findings show that in this low-data setting, the two approaches that use crowdsourcing or LLMs instead of involving experts achieve accurate classifications, while the LP-based approach has only limited potential. The promise of crowdsourcing and LLMs in this context might even extend to building training corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS); online appendix and supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15604749</p></details> |

Vulnerability repair investigates how to fix software vulnerabilities. Manual vulnerability repair is labor-intensive and time-consuming because it relies on human experts, highlighting the importance of Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR). In this SoK, we present the systematization of AVR methods through the three steps of AVR workflow: vulnerability analysis, patch generation, and patch validation. We assess AVR tools for C/C++ and Java programs as they have been widely studied by the community. Since existing AVR tools for C/C++ programs are evaluated with different datasets, which often consist of a few vulnerabilities, we construct the first C/C++ vulnerability repair benchmark dataset, dubbed Vul4C, which contains 144 vulnerabilities as well as their exploits and patches. We use Vul4C to evaluate seven AVR tools for C/C++ programs and use the third-party Vul4J dataset to evaluate two AVR tools for Java programs. We also discuss future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The full version of "SoK: Automated Vulnerability Repair: Methods, Tools, and Assessments" accepted by the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2025)</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical study on LLM-based Log Retrieval for Software Engineering Metadata Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11659v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing autonomous driving systems (ADSs) involves generating and storing extensive log data from test drives, which is essential for verification, research, and simulation. However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over varying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific driving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals representing various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as unfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals. Traditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both domain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are difficult to verify for accuracy. This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that combines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling natural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for specialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap indicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of query results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database querying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for intuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates improved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating dependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Property-based Test Generation for Guardrailing Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23549v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems that integrate physical, computational, and communication subsystems. The heterogeneous nature of these systems makes their safety assurance challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach for guardrailing cyber-physical systems using property-based tests (PBTs) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs an LLM to extract properties from the code and documentation of CPSs. Next, we use the LLM to generate PBTs that verify the extracted properties on the CPS. The generated PBTs have two uses. First, they are used to test the CPS before it is deployed, i.e., at design time. Secondly, these PBTs can be used after deployment, i.e., at run time, to monitor the behavior of the system and guardrail it against unsafe states. We implement our approach in ChekProp and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the generated PBTs in terms of their relevance (how well they match manually crafted properties), executability (how many run with minimal manual modification), and effectiveness (coverage of the input space partitions). The results of our experiments and evaluation demonstrate a promising path forward for creating guardrails for CPSs using LLM-generated property-based tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[KEENHash: Hashing Programs into Function-Aware Embeddings for Large-Scale Binary Code Similarity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11612v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding API Usage and Testing: An Empirical Study of C Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11598v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For library developers, understanding how their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are used in the field can be invaluable. Knowing how clients are using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug reports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of a bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API is used. In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage across 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a combined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how well library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for library developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API usage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that library developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use their API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a popular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by the library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be leveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7% with the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the APIs are used in the field. For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be used to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce various metrics useful to library developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, 17 to 20 June, 2025, Istanbul, Turkey</p></details> |
| **[Further Evidence on a Controversial Topic about Human-Based Experiments: Professionals vs. Students](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11597v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Software Engineering (SE) human-based controlled experiments rely on students as participants, raising concerns about their external validity. Specifically, the realism of results obtained from students and their applicability to the software industry remains in question. In this short paper, we bring further evidence on this controversial point. To do so, we compare 62 students and 42 software professionals on a bug-fixing task on the same Java program. The students were enrolled in a Bachelor's program in Computer Science, while the professionals were employed by two multinational companies (for one of them, the professionals were from two offices). Some variations in the experimental settings of the two groups (students and professionals) were present. For instance, the experimental environment of the experiment with professionals was more realistic; i.e., they faced some stress factors such as interruptions during the bug-fixing task. Considering the differences between the two groups of participants, the gathered data show that the students outperformed the professionals in fixing bugs. This diverges to some extent from past empirical evidence. Rather than presenting definitive conclusions, our results aim to catalyze the discussion on the use of students in experiments and pave the way for future investigations. Specifically, our results encourage us to examine the complex factors influencing SE tasks, making experiments as more realistic as possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Review Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11591v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code review comment generation (RCG) aims to assist developers by automatically producing natural language feedback for code changes. Existing approaches are primarily either generation-based, using pretrained language models, or information retrieval-based (IR), reusing comments from similar past examples. While generation-based methods leverage code-specific pretraining on large code-natural language corpora to learn semantic relationships between code and natural language, they often struggle to generate low-frequency but semantically important tokens due to their probabilistic nature. In contrast, IR-based methods excel at recovering such rare tokens by copying from existing examples but lack flexibility in adapting to new code contexts-for example, when input code contains identifiers or structures not found in the retrieval database. To bridge the gap between generation-based and IR-based methods, this work proposes to leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for RCG by conditioning pretrained language models on retrieved code-review exemplars. By providing relevant examples that illustrate how similar code has been previously reviewed, the model is better guided to generate accurate review comments. Our evaluation on the Tufano et al. benchmark shows that RAG-based RCG outperforms both generation-based and IR-based RCG. It achieves up to +1.67% higher exact match and +4.25% higher BLEU scores compared to generation-based RCG. It also improves the generation of low-frequency ground-truth tokens by up to 24.01%. We additionally find that performance improves as the number of retrieved exemplars increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[MBSR at Work: Perspectives from an Instructor and Software Developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11588v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the preliminary findings from a qualitative study (i.e., semi-structured interviews) on how a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, carried out in the Software Development (SD) working context, is perceived by the software developers of a multinational company who participated in the MBSR program and by the instructor who led it. MBSR is a deeply personal and experiential practice in helping individuals manage stress, particularly in high-pressure environments such as workplaces, healthcare settings, education, and other demanding professional or personal situations. Although MBSR has been experimented in different working contexts; surprisingly, it has never been studied in the SD working context where there are several stress factors that developers experience (e.g., time pressure and uncertainty about the content of a particular task and its outcome). In this respect, qualitative research can generate valuable insights into the application of MBSR in the SD working context that cannot be captured by standardized quantitative measures. Being MBSR instructors and software developers the key stakeholders in delivering an MBSR program in the SD working context, understanding their first-hand experiences can provide a more detailed picture of the investigated phenomenon. The most important takeaway result of our research can be summarized as follows: despite initial skepticism, the developers recognized personal improvements due to the MBSR practice, though the integration of MBSR techniques in the working context remained challenging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Helpful Context for LLM-based Vulnerability Repair: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11561v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42 vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's automated testing framework. Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4 with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26 (62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline (40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11559v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests with relatively minimal manual effort. Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4 can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant role in a partially automated process.</p></details> |  |

However, their applications to broader SE practices including conceptualization, design, and other non-code tasks, remain partially underexplored. This research aims to augment the generality and performance of LLMs for SE by (1) advancing the understanding of how LLMs with different characteristics perform on various non-code tasks, (2) evaluating them as sources of foundational knowledge in SE, and (3) effectively detecting hallucinations on SE statements. The expected contributions include a variety of LLMs trained and evaluated on domain-specific datasets, new benchmarks on foundational knowledge in SE, and methods for detecting hallucinations. Initial results in terms of performance improvements on various non-code tasks are promising.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Procedural Framework for Assessing the Desirability of Process Deviations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11525v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformance checking techniques help process analysts to identify where and how process executions deviate from a process model. However, they cannot determine the desirability of these deviations, i.e., whether they are problematic, acceptable or even beneficial for the process. Such desirability assessments are crucial to derive actions, but process analysts typically conduct them in a manual, ad-hoc way, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and irreplicable. To address this problem, this paper presents a procedural framework to guide process analysts in systematically assessing deviation desirability. It provides a step-by-step approach for identifying which input factors to consider in what order to categorize deviations into mutually exclusive desirability categories, each linked to action recommendations. The framework is based on a review and conceptualization of existing literature on deviation desirability, which is complemented by empirical insights from interviews with process analysis practitioners and researchers. We evaluate the framework through a desirability assessment task conducted with practitioners, indicating that the framework effectively enables them to streamline the assessment for a thorough yet concise evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VulStamp: Vulnerability Assessment using Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11484v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern vulnerability detection tools enable developers to efficiently identify numerous security flaws, indiscriminate remediation efforts often lead to superfluous development expenses. This is particularly true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency. Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types, VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to train the assessment model.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Do Large Language Models Serve as End-to-End Secure Code Agents for Python?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10495v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[VulScribeR: Exploring RAG-based Vulnerability Augmentation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04125v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting vulnerabilities is vital for software security, yet deep learning-based vulnerability detectors (DLVD) face a data shortage, which limits their effectiveness. Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of 497,742 issues mined from 1,209 open-source blockchain projects hosted on GitHub. Employing BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, we identify 49 distinct issue topics and organize them hierarchically into 11 major subcategories. Our analysis reveals that both general software development issues and blockchain-specific concerns are nearly equally represented, with Wallet Management and UI Enhancement emerging as the most prominent topics. We further examine the temporal evolution of issue categories and resolution times, finding that Wallet issues not only dominate in frequency but also exhibit the longest resolution time. Conversely, Mechanisms issues are resolved significantly faster. Issue frequency surged after 2016 with the rise of Ethereum and decentralized applications, but declined after 2022. These findings enhance our understanding of blockchain software maintenance, informing the development of specialized tools and practices to improve robustness and maintainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVeal: Self-Evolving Code Agents via Iterative Generation-Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11442v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification, leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a step-by-step guide to establishing a robust autonomous drone testing pipeline, covering each critical stage: Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) Simulation Testing, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing, Controlled Real-World Testing, and In-Field Testing. Using practical examples, including the marker-based autonomous landing system, we demonstrate how to systematically verify drone system behaviors, identify integration issues, and optimize performance. Furthermore, we highlight emerging trends shaping the future of drone testing, including the integration of Neurosymbolic and LLMs, creating co-simulation environments, and Digital Twin-enabled simulation-based testing techniques. By following this pipeline, developers and researchers can achieve comprehensive validation, minimize deployment risks, and prepare autonomous drones for safe and reliable real-world operations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Invocable APIs derived from NL2SQL datasets for LLM Tool-Calling Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11266v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL (Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+32...</summary><p>10+32 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2) execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy) for automatic code refinement.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[On Mutation-Guided Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02954v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software. While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Cure: LLM-based Competitor User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15724v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

As CPS grow in complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software, and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for automated and comparative evaluation. Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly compose systems or integrate components across platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed, component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and development.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |

Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://livecodebenchpro.com/</p></details> |

Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |

However, employing tools like GeoPandas, a prominent Python library for geospatial data manipulation, necessitates expertise in complex domain-specific syntax and workflows. GeoPandas-AI addresses this gap by integrating LLMs directly into the GeoPandas workflow, transforming the GeoDataFrame class into an intelligent, stateful class for both data analysis and geospatial code development. This paper formalizes the design of such a smart class and provides an open-source implementation of GeoPandas-AI in PyPI package manager.

The heterogeneous nature of these systems makes their safety assurance challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach for guardrailing cyber-physical systems using property-based tests (PBTs) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs an LLM to extract properties from the code and documentation of CPSs. Next, we use the LLM to generate PBTs that verify the extracted properties on the CPS. The generated PBTs have two uses. First, they are used to test the CPS before it is deployed, i.e., at design time. Secondly, these PBTs can be used after deployment, i.e., at run time, to monitor the behavior of the system and guardrail it against unsafe states. We implement our approach in ChekProp and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the generated PBTs in terms of their relevance (how well they match manually crafted properties), executability (how many run with minimal manual modification), and effectiveness (coverage of the input space partitions). The results of our experiments and evaluation demonstrate a promising path forward for creating guardrails for CPSs using LLM-generated property-based tests.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Review Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11591v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code review comment generation (RCG) aims to assist developers by automatically producing natural language feedback for code changes. Existing approaches are primarily either generation-based, using pretrained language models, or information retrieval-based (IR), reusing comments from similar past examples. While generation-based methods leverage code-specific pretraining on large code-natural language corpora to learn semantic relationships between code and natural language, they often struggle to generate low-frequency but semantically important tokens due to their probabilistic nature. In contrast, IR-based methods excel at recovering such rare tokens by copying from existing examples but lack flexibility in adapting to new code contexts-for example, when input code contains identifiers or structures not found in the retrieval database. To bridge the gap between generation-based and IR-based methods, this work proposes to leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for RCG by conditioning pretrained language models on retrieved code-review exemplars. By providing relevant examples that illustrate how similar code has been previously reviewed, the model is better guided to generate accurate review comments. Our evaluation on the Tufano et al. benchmark shows that RAG-based RCG outperforms both generation-based and IR-based RCG. It achieves up to +1.67% higher exact match and +4.25% higher BLEU scores compared to generation-based RCG. It also improves the generation of low-frequency ground-truth tokens by up to 24.01%. We additionally find that performance improves as the number of retrieved exemplars increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Helpful Context for LLM-based Vulnerability Repair: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11561v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42 vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's automated testing framework. Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4 with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26 (62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline (40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11559v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests with relatively minimal manual effort. Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4 can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant role in a partially automated process.</p></details> |  |

| **[VulStamp: Vulnerability Assessment using Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11484v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern vulnerability detection tools enable developers to efficiently identify numerous security flaws, indiscriminate remediation efforts often lead to superfluous development expenses. This is particularly true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency. Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types, VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to train the assessment model.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Do Large Language Models Serve as End-to-End Secure Code Agents for Python?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10495v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</p></details> |  |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[ReVeal: Self-Evolving Code Agents via Iterative Generation-Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11442v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification, leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invocable APIs derived from NL2SQL datasets for LLM Tool-Calling Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11266v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL (Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+32...</summary><p>10+32 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2) execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy) for automatic code refinement.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[On Mutation-Guided Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02954v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software. While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |

Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://livecodebenchpro.com/</p></details> |

Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |
