This paper assesses multiple approaches to Rocq generation and illuminates potential avenues for improvement. We identify retrieval-based premise selection as a central component of effective Rocq proof generation and propose a novel approach based on a self-attentive embedder model. The evaluation of the designed approach shows up to 28% relative increase of the generator's performance. We tackle the problem of writing Rocq proofs using a multi-stage agentic system, tailored for formal verification, and demonstrate its high effectiveness. We conduct an ablation study and demonstrate that incorporating multi-agent debate during the planning stage increases the proof success rate by 20% overall and nearly doubles it for complex theorems, while the reflection mechanism further enhances stability and consistency.</p></details> |  |

However, the alignment between these messages and the actual changes remains unexplored, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of AI agents. To fill this gap, we analyzed 23,247 agentic PRs across five agents using PR message-code inconsistency (PR-MCI). We contributed 974 manually annotated PRs, found 406 PRs (1.7%) exhibited high PR-MCI, and identified eight PR-MCI types, revealing that "descriptions claim unimplemented changes" was the most common issue (45.4%). Statistical tests confirmed that high-MCI PRs had 51.7% lower acceptance rates (28.3% vs. 80.0%) and took 3.5 times longer to merge (55.8 vs. 16.0 hours). Our findings suggest that unreliable PR descriptions undermine trust in AI agents, highlighting the need for PR-MCI verification mechanisms and improved PR generation to enable trustworthy human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MSR'26 Mining Challenge Track</p></details> |

The proliferation of IoT devices leads to the generation of large amounts of IoT data providing a window on the physical context of BPs, which facilitates the discovery of new insights about BPs using process mining (PM) techniques. However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies these common requirements.</p></details> |  |

The proliferation of IoT devices leads to the generation of large amounts of IoT data providing a window on the physical context of BPs, which facilitates the discovery of new insights about BPs using process mining (PM) techniques. However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies these common requirements.</p></details> |  |

However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies these common requirements.</p></details> |  |
