| **[Green Resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems: Doctoral Dissertation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16593v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing Smart Contract Languages with a Unified Agentic Framework for Vulnerability Repair in Solidity and Move](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18515v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of the blockchain ecosystem and the increasing value locked in smart contracts necessitate robust security measures. While languages like Solidity and Move aim to improve smart contract security, vulnerabilities persist. This paper presents Smartify, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically detect and repair vulnerabilities in Solidity and Move smart contracts. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on vast pre-training datasets, Smartify employs a team of specialized agents working on different specially fine-tuned LLMs to analyze code based on underlying programming concepts and language-specific security principles. We evaluated Smartify on a dataset for Solidity and a curated dataset for Move, demonstrating its effectiveness in fixing a wide range of vulnerabilities. Our results show that Smartify (Gemma2+codegemma) achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLMs and enhancing general-purpose models' capabilities, such as Llama 3.1. Notably, Smartify can incorporate language-specific knowledge, such as the nuances of Move, without requiring massive language-specific pre-training datasets. This work offers a detailed analysis of various LLMs' performance on smart contract repair, highlighting the strengths of our multi-agent approach and providing a blueprint for developing more secure and reliable decentralized applications in the growing blockchain landscape. We also provide a detailed recipe for extending this to other similar use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Annotation Quality Problems in AI-Enabled Perception System Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16410v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data annotation is essential but highly error-prone in the development of AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) for automated driving, and its quality directly influences model performance, safety, and reliability. However, the industry lacks empirical insights into how annotation errors emerge and spread across the multi-organisational automotive supply chain. This study addresses this gap through a multi-organisation case study involving six companies and four research institutes across Europe and the UK. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews with 20 experts (50 hours of transcripts) and a six-phase thematic analysis, we develop a taxonomy of 18 recurring annotation error types across three data-quality dimensions: completeness (e.g., attribute omission, missing feedback loops, edge-case omissions, selection bias), accuracy (e.g., mislabelling, bounding-box inaccuracies, granularity mismatches, bias-driven errors), and consistency (e.g., inter-annotator disagreement, ambiguous instructions, misaligned hand-offs, cross-modality inconsistencies). The taxonomy was validated with industry practitioners, who reported its usefulness for root-cause analysis, supplier quality reviews, onboarding, and improving annotation guidelines. They described it as a failure-mode catalogue similar to FMEA. By conceptualising annotation quality as a lifecycle and supply-chain issue, this study contributes to SE4AI by offering a shared vocabulary, diagnostic toolset, and actionable guidance for building trustworthy AI-enabled perception systems.</p></details> |  |

Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.</p></details> |  |

While languages like Solidity and Move aim to improve smart contract security, vulnerabilities persist. This paper presents Smartify, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically detect and repair vulnerabilities in Solidity and Move smart contracts. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on vast pre-training datasets, Smartify employs a team of specialized agents working on different specially fine-tuned LLMs to analyze code based on underlying programming concepts and language-specific security principles. We evaluated Smartify on a dataset for Solidity and a curated dataset for Move, demonstrating its effectiveness in fixing a wide range of vulnerabilities. Our results show that Smartify (Gemma2+codegemma) achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLMs and enhancing general-purpose models' capabilities, such as Llama 3.1. Notably, Smartify can incorporate language-specific knowledge, such as the nuances of Move, without requiring massive language-specific pre-training datasets.
