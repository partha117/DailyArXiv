DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation: A Survey with Focus on Repository-Level Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04905v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved automated code generation. While function-level and file-level generation have achieved promising results, real-world software development typically requires reasoning across entire repositories. This gives rise to the challenging task of Repository-Level Code Generation (RLCG), where models must capture long-range dependencies, ensure global semantic consistency, and generate coherent code spanning multiple files or modules. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that integrates external retrieval mechanisms with LLMs, enhancing context-awareness and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research on Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), with an emphasis on repository-level approaches. We categorize existing work along several dimensions, including generation strategies, retrieval modalities, model architectures, training paradigms, and evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we summarize widely used datasets and benchmarks, analyze current limitations, and outline key challenges and opportunities for future research. Our goal is to establish a unified analytical framework for understanding this rapidly evolving field and to inspire continued progress in AI-powered software engineering.</p></details> |  |

| **[Understanding User Mental Models in AI-Driven Code Completion Tools: Insights from an Elicitation Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02194v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated Development Environments increasingly implement AI-powered code completion tools (CCTs), which promise to enhance developer efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. However, interaction challenges with CCTs persist, mainly due to mismatches between developers' mental models and the unpredictable behavior of AI-generated suggestions, which is an aspect underexplored in the literature. We conducted an elicitation study with 56 developers using co-design workshops to elicit their mental models when interacting with CCTs. Different important findings that might drive the interaction design with CCTs emerged. For example, developers expressed diverse preferences on when and how code suggestions should be triggered (proactive, manual, hybrid), where and how they are displayed (inline, sidebar, popup, chatbot), as well as the level of detail. It also emerged that developers need to be supported by customization of activation timing, display modality, suggestion granularity, and explanation content, to better fit the CCT to their preferences. To demonstrate the feasibility of these and the other guidelines that emerged during the study, we developed ATHENA, a proof-of-concept CCT that dynamically adapts to developers' coding preferences and environments, ensuring seamless integration into diverse workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreshBrew: A Benchmark for Evaluating AI Agents on Java Code Migration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04852v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding assistants are rapidly becoming integral to modern software development. A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

Despite advances in fuzzing techniques, such as coverage-guided greybox fuzzing, many fuzzers struggle with coverage plateaus caused by fuzz blockers, limiting their ability to find deeper vulnerabilities. Human expertise can address these challenges, but analyzing fuzzing results to guide this support remains labor-intensive. To tackle this, we introduce InsightQL, the first human-assisting framework for fuzz blocker analysis. Powered by a unified database and an intuitive parameterized query interface, InsightQL aids developers in systematically extracting insights and efficiently unblocking fuzz blockers. Our experiments on 14 popular real-world libraries from the FuzzBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of InsightQL, leading to the unblocking of many fuzz blockers and considerable improvements in code coverage (up to 13.90%).</p></details> |  |

| **[GUISpector: An MLLM Agent Framework for Automated Verification of Natural Language Requirements in GUI Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04791v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUIs are foundational to interactive systems and play a pivotal role in early requirements elicitation through prototyping. Ensuring that GUI implementations fulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering, especially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into development workflows. Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or LLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces, and typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated development agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework that leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification of NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to interpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and execute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector systematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification process, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to iteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code generation in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that unifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for supervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the end-to-end requirements verification process. We evaluated GUISpector on a comprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria annotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection of requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for seamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven development workflows. The video presentation of GUISpector is available at: https://youtu.be/JByYF6BNQeE, showcasing its main capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[RedCodeAgent: Automatic Red-teaming Agent against Diverse Code Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02609v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing for Novice Debuggers: A Pilot Study on an AI-Assisted Debugging Tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21067v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a fundamental skill that novice programmers must develop. Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging approach should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with the tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |
| **[When Shared Worlds Break: Demystifying Defects in Multi-User Extended Reality Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01182v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-user Extended Reality (XR) systems enable transformative shared experiences but introduce unique software defects that compromise user experience. Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap, this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity. Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes. Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts. Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences, necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |
| **[Vibe Coding in Practice: Motivations, Challenges, and a Future Outlook -- a Grey Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00328v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools are transforming software development, especially for novice and non-software developers, by enabling them to write code and build applications faster and with little to no human intervention. Vibe coding is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code. Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101 practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools' outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers, particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping, but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-box Context-free Grammar Inference for Readable & Natural Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26616v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis, reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada, and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large, complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJjFfnxUx0.</p></details> |  |
| **[TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Code Generation with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00083v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress (V2)</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence-Guided Concolic Testing of Transformer Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23806v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an {influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible, pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring, compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that (i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration, and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering potential utility for debugging and model auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Specific Instruction: A Longitudinal Study on Debugging Skill Acquisition and Retention for Novice Programmers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22420v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localization is a critical skill, yet novices often lack systematic approaches. Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps; the impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week longitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract guidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that pairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4). Forty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5). Each session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element containing a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to completion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and strategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to completion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other groups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p < 0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other groups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses showed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants internalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that context-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger retention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions produced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized performance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may bridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more equitable path for novices.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (25 pages for the paper, rest pages are references and appendix). 4 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[SecureAgentBench: Benchmarking Secure Code Generation under Realistic Vulnerability Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22097v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents (SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions, (ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step toward more reliable software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Python Programming Education with an AI-Powered Code Helper: Design, Implementation, and Impact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20518v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Co-evolutionary Metamorphic Differential Testing for Autonomous Systems with an Interpretability Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16478v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, such as autonomous driving systems, evolve rapidly through frequent updates, risking unintended behavioral degradations. Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment. CoCoMagic offers an efficient, effective, and interpretable way for the differential testing of evolving autonomous systems across versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous systems, giving rise to a new class of software known as Agentware, where LLM-powered agents perform complex, open-ended tasks in domains such as software engineering, customer service, and data analysis. However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |

Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |

Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |

A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rethinking Technology Stack Selection with AI Coding Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11132v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now an integral part of software development workflows and are reshaping the whole process. Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[ViScratch: Using Large Language Models and Gameplay Videos for Automated Feedback in Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11065v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based programming environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in programming education, in particular for young learners. While the use of blocks helps prevent syntax errors, semantic bugs remain common and difficult to debug. Existing tools for Scratch debugging rely heavily on predefined rules or user manual inputs, and crucially, they ignore the platform's inherently visual nature. We introduce ViScratch, the first multimodal feedback generation system for Scratch that leverages both the project's block code and its generated gameplay video to diagnose and repair bugs. ViScratch uses a two-stage pipeline: a vision-language model first aligns visual symptoms with code structure to identify a single critical issue, then proposes minimal, abstract syntax tree level repairs that are verified via execution in the Scratch virtual machine. We evaluate ViScratch on a set of real-world Scratch projects against state-of-the-art LLM-based tools and human testers. Results show that gameplay video is a crucial debugging signal: ViScratch substantially outperforms prior tools in both bug identification and repair quality, even without access to project descriptions or goals. This work demonstrates that video can serve as a first-class specification in visual programming environments, opening new directions for LLM-based debugging beyond symbolic code alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Testing and Adapting REST APIs as LLM Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15546v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build autonomous agents that perform complex tasks with external tools, often exposed through APIs in enterprise systems. Direct use of these APIs is difficult due to the complex input schema and verbose responses. Current benchmarks overlook these challenges, leaving a gap in assessing API readiness for agent-driven automation. We present a testing framework that systematically evaluates enterprise APIs when wrapped as Python tools for LLM-based agents. The framework generates data-aware test cases, translates them into natural language instructions, and evaluates whether agents can correctly invoke the tool, handle their inputs, and process its responses. We apply the framework to generate over 2400 test cases across different domains and develop a taxonomy of common errors, including input misinterpretation, output failures, and schema mismatches. We further classify errors to support debugging and tool refinement. Our framework provides a systematic approach to enabling enterprise APIs as reliable tools for agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aspect-Oriented Programming in Secure Software Development: A Case Study of Security Aspects in Web Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07449v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security remains a critical challenge in modern web applications, where threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks continue to undermine trust and reliability. Traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality, leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging, and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches. Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code, coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators. Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers seeking to balance security with software quality in web application development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Challenging Bug Prediction and Repair Models with Synthetic Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02407v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs are essential in software engineering; many research studies in the past decades have been proposed to detect, localize, and repair bugs in software systems. Effectiveness evaluation of such techniques requires complex bugs, i.e., those that are hard to detect through testing and hard to repair through debugging. From the classic software engineering point of view, a hard-to-repair bug differs from the correct code in multiple locations, making it hard to localize and repair. Hard-to-detect bugs, on the other hand, manifest themselves under specific test inputs and reachability conditions. These two objectives, i.e., generating hard-to-detect and hard-to-repair bugs, are mostly aligned; a bug generation technique can change multiple statements to be covered only under a specific set of inputs. However, these two objectives are conflicting for learning-based techniques: A bug should have a similar code representation to the correct code in the training data to challenge a bug prediction model to distinguish them. The hard-to-repair bug definition remains the same but with a caveat: the more a bug differs from the original code, the more distant their representations are and easier to be detected. We propose BugFarm, to transform arbitrary code into multiple complex bugs. BugFarm leverages LLMs to mutate code in multiple locations (hard-to-repair). To ensure that multiple modifications do not notably change the code representation, BugFarm analyzes the attention of the underlying model and instructs LLMs to only change the least attended locations (hard-to-detect). Our comprehensive evaluation of 435k+ bugs from over 1.9M mutants generated by BUGFARM and two alternative approaches demonstrates our superiority in generating bugs that are hard to detect by learning-based bug prediction approaches and hard-to-repair by state-of-the-art learning-based program repair technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in SCAM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and repairing faults when programs fail to formally verify can be complex and time-consuming. Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIO: Multiverse Debugging in the Face of Input/Output -- Extended Version with Additional Appendices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06845v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution paths within the state space. Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e. states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse, may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is caused by the debugger. This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during regular execution. We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our techniques. As a demonstration of the approach we highlight a color dial built with a Lego Mindstorms motor, and color sensor, providing a tangible example of how our approach enables multiverse debugging for programs running on an STM32 microcontroller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This extended version provides auxiliary material to the article of the same title that will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the PACMPL issue for OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging. While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22 subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs, where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well in repository-level debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures, EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Large Language Models in Software Engineering Education: A Pilot Study through GitHub Repositories Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04877v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly adopted in software engineering (SE) education, offering both opportunities and challenges. Their adoption requires systematic investigation to ensure responsible integration into curricula. Objective: This doctoral research aims to develop a validated framework for integrating LLMs into SE education through a multi-phase process, including taxonomies development, empirical investigation, and case studies. This paper presents the first empirical step. Method: We conducted a pilot repository mining study of 400 GitHub projects, analyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of motivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8] study. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits), software engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming assistance and debugging support (97 hits) were strongly represented. Demotivators, including plagiarism and IP concerns (385 hits), security, privacy and data integrity (87 hits), and over-reliance on AI in learning (39 hits), also appeared prominently. In contrast, demotivators such as challenges in evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded no hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical validation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes, highlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a comprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE education.</p></details> |  |

While classical software engineering has evolved with various tools and methodologies to tackle such bugs, the emergence of quantum computing presents unique challenges. Quantum software development introduces complexities due to the probabilistic nature of quantum computing, distinct algorithmic primitives, and potential hardware noise. In this paper, we introduce CircInspect, an interactive tool tailored for debugging quantum programs in Python and PennyLane.

| **[On Developers' Self-Declaration of AI-Generated Code: An Analysis of Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16485v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers, who use them to assist in software development due to their capability to generate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 15 images, 8 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the dynamic data dependency of a step that reads a variable $v$ is challenging. It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An experience-based classification of quantum bugs in quantum software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03280v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However, the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong, which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that - unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic quantum debugging strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

| **[A Multi-stage Error Diagnosis for APB Transaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03554v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access, Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |

We present a framework that integrates spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT. This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchTrack: A Comprehensive Analysis of ChatGPT's Influence on Pull Request Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07700v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has introduced new dynamics in software development, particularly within pull request workflows. While prior research has examined the quality of AI-generated code, little is known about how developers actually use these suggestions in real-world collaboration. We analyze 338 pull requests from 255 GitHub repositories containing self-admitted ChatGPT usage, including 645 AI-generated snippets and 3,486 developer-authored patches. We introduce PatchTrack, a tool that classifies whether ChatGPT patches were applied, not applied, or not suggested, enabling fine-grained analysis of AI-assisted decisions. Full adoption of ChatGPT code is rare: the median integration rate was 25%. A qualitative analysis of 89 pull requests with integrated patches revealed recurring patterns of structural integration, selective extraction, and iterative refinement, showing that developers typically treat ChatGPT's output as a starting point rather than a final implementation. Even when code was not directly adopted, ChatGPT influenced workflows through conceptual guidance, documentation, and debugging strategies. Integration decisions were shaped by scope, architectural fit, contributor role, and review norms. This study offers empirical insight into how generative AI is used in collaborative software development, showing that its impact extends beyond patch generation to broader decision-making. Our findings inform the design of AI-assisted tools, clarify patch adoption behavior, and support more transparent and effective use of LLMs in practice.</p></details> | 53 pages, 8 figures |

Therefore, effective and efficient debugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However, the teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in indirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer Science (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way. In this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging that interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance aims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper learning experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be integrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. We developed a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization techniques and large language models. Students can use features like the automated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and executed a small-scale, controlled experiment with eight undergraduate CS students. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the systematic guidance. They rated the automated setting of breakpoints as most effective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the breakpoint explanations. In future, we will extend our concept and implementation, and perform more intensive user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE-NIER 2025</p></details> |

Monitoring through logging a long-standing practice in traditional software offers a potential means for auditing ML applications, as logs provide traceable records of system behavior useful for debugging, performance analysis, and continuous auditing. systematically auditing models for compliance or accountability. The findings underscore the need for enhanced logging practices and tooling that systematically integrate responsible AI metrics. Such practices would support the development of auditable, transparent, and ethically responsible ML systems, aligning with growing regulatory requirements and societal expectations.

| **[What Did I Do Wrong? Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334v4)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025)</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

Existing agent-based methods often struggle to fully and accurately reproduce implementation details such as mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic. Previous studies show that reflection with explicit feedback improves agent performance. However, current paper reproduction methods fail to effectively adopt this strategy. This gap mainly arises from the diverse paper patterns, complex method modules, and varied configurations encountered in research papers. Motivated by how humans use systematic checklists to efficiently debug complex code, we propose \textbf{RePro}, a \textbf{Re}flective Paper-to-Code \textbf{Repro}duction framework that automatically extracts a paper's fingerprint, referring to a comprehensive set of accurate and atomic criteria serving as high-quality supervisory signals. The framework first generates code based on the extracted information, and then leverages the fingerprint within iterative verification and refinement loop. This approach systematically detects discrepancies and produces targeted revisions to align generated code with the paper's implementation details. Extensive experiments on the PaperBench Code-Dev benchmark have been conducted, RePro achieves 13.0\% performance gap over baselines, and it correctly revises complex logical and mathematical criteria in reflecting, on which the effectiveness is obvious.</p></details> |  |

This problem is especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems. Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations. These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes. Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely accessible to all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICWE 2025, Delft (30 June - 03 July 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defects4Log: Benchmarking LLMs for Logging Code Defect Detection and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11305v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.</p></details> |  |

Unlike most existing approaches that treat individual seeds as tasks, DynamiQ leverages structural information from the program's call graph to define tasks and continuously refines task allocation using runtime feedback. This design significantly reduces redundant exploration and enhances fuzzing efficiency at scale. Built on top of the state-of-the-art LibAFL framework, DynamiQ incorporates several practical optimizations in both task allocation and task-aware fuzzing. Evaluated on 12 real-world targets from OSS-Fuzz and FuzzBench over 25,000 CPU hours, DynamiQ outperforms state-of-the-art parallel fuzzers in both code coverage and vulnerability discovery, uncovering 9 previously unknown bugs in widely used and extensively fuzzed open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving IR-based Bug Localization with Semantics-Driven Query Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04468v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of research, software bug localization remains challenging due to heterogeneous content and inherent ambiguities in bug reports. Existing methods such as Information Retrieval (IR)-based approaches often attempt to match source documents to bug reports, overlooking the context and semantics of the source code. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g., Transformer models) show promising results in understanding both texts and code. However, they have not been yet adapted well to localize software bugs against bug reports. They could be also data or resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we propose, IQLoc, a novel bug localization approach that capitalizes on the strengths of both IR and LLM-based approaches. In particular, we leverage the program semantics understanding of transformer-based models to reason about the suspiciousness of code and reformulate queries during bug localization using Information Retrieval. To evaluate IQLoc, we refine the Bench4BL benchmark dataset and extend it by incorporating ~30% more recent bug reports, resulting in a benchmark containing ~7.5K bug reports. We evaluated IQLoc using three performance metrics and compare it against four baseline techniques. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority, achieving up to 58.52% and 60.59% in MAP, 61.49% and 64.58% in MRR, and 69.88% and 100.90% in HIT@K for the test bug reports with random and time-wise splits, respectively. Moreover, IQLoc improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces, 72.73% for those that include code elements, and 65.38% for those containing only descriptions in natural language. By integrating program semantic understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc mitigates several longstanding challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Extracting Conceptual Knowledge to Locate Software Issues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21427v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue localization, which identifies faulty code elements such as files or functions, is critical for effective bug fixing. While recent LLM-based and LLM-agent-based approaches improve accuracy, they struggle in large-scale repositories due to concern tangling, where relevant logic is buried in large functions, and concern scattering, where related logic is dispersed across files. To address these challenges, we propose RepoLens, a novel approach that abstracts and leverages conceptual knowledge from code repositories. RepoLens decomposes fine-grained functionalities and recomposes them into high-level concerns, semantically coherent clusters of functionalities that guide LLMs. It operates in two stages: an offline stage that extracts and enriches conceptual knowledge into a repository-wide knowledge base, and an online stage that retrieves issue-specific terms, clusters and ranks concerns by relevance, and integrates them into localization workflows via minimally intrusive prompt enhancements. We evaluate RepoLens on SWE-Lancer-Loc, a benchmark of 216 tasks derived from SWE-Lancer. RepoLens consistently improves three state-of-the-art tools, namely AgentLess, OpenHands, and mini-SWE-agent, achieving average gains of over 22% in Hit@k and 46% in Recall@k for file- and function-level localization. It generalizes across models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1) with Hit@1 and Recall@10 gains up to 504% and 376%, respectively. Ablation studies and manual evaluation confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the constructed concerns.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems also introduce unique challenges, particularly in maintaining software quality and performance. Among these challenges, Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) has emerged as a growing concern, significantly impacting the maintainability and overall quality of ML and DL-enabled systems. Despite its critical implications, the lifecycle of DL-specific SATD, how developers introduce, acknowledge, and address it over time-remains underexplored. This study presents a preliminary analysis of the persistence and lifecycle of DL-specific SATD in DL-enabled systems. The purpose of this project is to uncover the patterns of SATD introduction, recognition, and durability during the development life cycle, providing information on how to manage these issues. Using mining software repository techniques, we examined 40 ML projects, focusing on 185 DL-specific SATD instances. The analysis tracked the introduction and persistence of SATD instances through project commit histories to assess their lifecycle and developer actions. The findings indicate that DL-specific SATD is predominantly introduced during the early and middle stages of project development. Training and Hardware phases showed the longest SATD durations, highlighting critical areas where debt accumulates and persists. Additionally, developers introduce DL-specific SATD more frequently during feature implementation and bug fixes. This study emphasizes the need for targeted DL-specific SATD management strategies in DL-enabled systems to mitigate its impact. By understanding the temporal characteristics and evolution of DL-specific SATD, developers can prioritize interventions at critical stages to improve the maintainability and quality of the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Workshop of Software Quality Assurance for Artificial Intelligence 2025 (SQA4AI), Montr\'eal, Canada</p></details> |

Functional bugs, instances where implementations diverge from behaviors specified in RFC documents, can lead to severe consequences, including faulty routing, authentication bypasses, and service disruptions. Detecting these bugs requires deep semantic analysis across specification documents and source code, a task beyond the capabilities of traditional static analysis tools. This paper introduces RFCAudit, an autonomous agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect functional bugs by checking conformance between network protocol implementations and their RFC specifications. Inspired by the human auditing procedure, RFCAudit comprises two key components: an indexing agent and a detection agent. The former hierarchically summarizes protocol code semantics, generating semantic indexes that enable the detection agent to narrow down the scanning scope. The latter employs demand-driven retrieval to iteratively collect additional relevant data structures and functions, eventually identifying potential inconsistencies with the RFC specifications effectively. We evaluate RFCAudit across six real-world network protocol implementations. RFCAudit identifies 47 functional bugs with 81.9% precision, of which 20 bugs have been confirmed or fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wired for Reuse: Automating Context-Aware Code Adaptation in IDEs via LLM-Based Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01315v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Copy-paste-modify is a widespread and pragmatic practice in software development, where developers adapt reused code snippets, sourced from platforms such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or LLM outputs, into their local codebase. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this adaptation is code wiring: the context-aware process of substituting unresolved variables in pasted code with suitable variables or expressions from the surrounding context. Existing solutions either rely on heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively utilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of adaptation cases are context-dependent. In this paper, we introduce WIRL, an LLM-based agent for code wiring framed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) infilling task. WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an orchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and perform context-aware substitutions. To balance efficiency and autonomy, the agent adopts a mixed strategy: deterministic rule-based steps for common patterns, and a state-machine-guided decision process for intelligent exploration. We evaluate WIRL on a carefully curated, high-quality dataset consisting of real-world code adaptation scenarios. Our approach achieves an exact match precision of 91.7% and a recall of 90.0%, outperforming advanced LLMs by 22.6 and 13.7 percentage points in precision and recall, respectively, and surpassing IntelliJ IDEA by 54.3 and 49.9 percentage points. These results underscore its practical utility, particularly in contexts with complex variable dependencies or multiple unresolved variables. We believe WIRL paves the way for more intelligent and context-aware developer assistance in modern IDEs.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE2025 |

However, despite their promise, current LLM-based APR techniques often struggle to produce correct fixes due to limited understanding of code context and over-reliance on incomplete test suites. As a result, they frequently generate Draft Patches-partially correct patches that either incompletely address the bug or overfit to the test cases. In this work, we propose a novel patch refinement framework, Refine, that systematically transforms Draft Patches into correct ones. Refine addresses three key challenges: disambiguating vague issue and code context, diversifying patch candidates through test-time scaling, and aggregating partial fixes via an LLM-powered code review process. We implement Refine as a general refinement module that can be integrated into both open-agent-based and workflow-based APR systems. Our evaluation on the SWE-Bench Lite benchmark shows that Refine achieves state-of-the-art results among workflow-based approaches and approaches the best-known performance across all APR categories. Specifically, Refine boosts AutoCodeRover's performance by 14.67%, achieving a score of 51.67% and surpassing all prior baselines. On SWE-Bench Verified, Refine improves the resolution rate by 12.2%, and when integrated across multiple APR systems, it yields an average improvement of 14%-demonstrating its broad effectiveness and generalizability. These results highlight the effectiveness of refinement as a missing component in current APR pipelines and the potential of agentic collaboration in closing the gap between near-correct and correct patches.

However, updating a library can introduce breaking changes in the code, necessitating significant developer time for maintenance. To address this, we introduce a framework of LLM agents to be used in combination with migration documentation to automatically recommend and apply code updates and ensure compatibility with new versions. Our solution can automatically localize updated library usages in live Java codebases and implement recommended fixes in a user-friendly manner. The system architecture consists of multiple key components: a Summary Agent, Control Agent, and Code Agent. To validate our approach, we apply the framework on an industrial use case by which we create three synthetic code repositories with major Upgrade changes and benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our approach not only performs upgrades using fewer tokens across all cases but also achieves a precision of 71.4%, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstain and Validate: A Dual-LLM Policy for Reducing Noise in Agentic Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03217v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex, repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise, wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports, patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale deployment of agentic APR systems.</p></details> |  |

However, randomized mutation strategies have limited the fuzzer's performance on structured data. Specialized fuzzers can handle complex structured data, but require additional efforts in grammar and suffer from low throughput. In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing the Large Language Model to enhance greybox fuzzing for structured data. We utilize the pre-trained knowledge of LLM about data conversion and format to generate new valid inputs. We further fine-tuned it with paired mutation seeds to learn structured format and mutation strategies effectively. Our LLM-based fuzzer, LLAMAFUZZ, integrates the power of LLM to understand and mutate structured data to fuzzing. We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a wide variety of real-world programs. LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor by 41 bugs on average. We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials. Moreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and bug reached. Compared to AFL++, LLAMAFUZZ achieved 27.19% more branches in real-world program sets on average. We also demonstrate a case study to explain how LLMs enhance the fuzzing process in terms of code coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

Academic research, industrial projects (e.g., Amazon Braket, IBM Qiskit), and consortiums like 'Quantum Flagship' are striving to develop practically capable and commercially viable quantum computing (QC) systems and technologies. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is viewed as a solution attuned to the philosophy of service-orientation that can offer QC resources and platforms, as utility computing, to individuals and organisations who do not own quantum computers. This research investigates a process-centric and architecture-driven approach to offer a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS - a.k.a quantum service-orientation. We employed a two-phase research method comprising (a) a systematic mapping study and (b) an architecture-based development, first to identify the phases of the quantum service development life cycle and subsequently to integrate these phases into a reference architecture that supports QCaaS. The SMS process retrieved a collection of potentially relevant research literature and based on a multi-step selection and qualitative assessment, we selected 41 peer-reviewed studies to answer three RQs. The RQs investigate (i) demographic details in terms of frequency, types, and trends of research, (ii) phases of quantum service development lifecycle to derive a reference architecture for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of services, and (iii) The results identify a 4-phased development lifecycle along with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations, catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can be integrated in a layered reference architecture to engineer QCaaS.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 10 images, 5 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrofitting Control Flow Graphs in LLVM IR for Auto Vectorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04890v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern processors increasingly rely on SIMD instruction sets, such as AVX and RVV, to significantly enhance parallelism and computational performance. However, production-ready compilers like LLVM and GCC often fail to fully exploit available vectorization opportunities due to disjoint vectorization passes and limited extensibility. Although recent attempts in heuristics and intermediate representation (IR) designs have attempted to address these problems, efficiently simplifying control flow analysis and accurately identifying vectorization opportunities remain challenging tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a novel vectorization pipeline featuring two specialized IR extensions: SIR, which encodes high-level structural information, and VIR, which explicitly represents instruction dependencies through data dependency analysis. Leveraging the detailed dependency information provided by VIR, we develop a flexible and extensible vectorization framework. This approach substantially improves interoperability across vectorization passes and expands the search space for identifying isomorphic instructions, ultimately enhancing both the scope and efficiency of automatic vectorization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed vectorization pipeline achieves significant performance improvements, delivering speedups of up to 53% and 58% compared to LLVM and GCC, respectively.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[GUISpector: An MLLM Agent Framework for Automated Verification of Natural Language Requirements in GUI Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04791v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUIs are foundational to interactive systems and play a pivotal role in early requirements elicitation through prototyping. Ensuring that GUI implementations fulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering, especially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into development workflows. Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or LLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces, and typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated development agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework that leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification of NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to interpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and execute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector systematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification process, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to iteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code generation in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that unifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for supervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the end-to-end requirements verification process. We evaluated GUISpector on a comprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria annotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection of requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for seamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven development workflows. The video presentation of GUISpector is available at: https://youtu.be/JByYF6BNQeE, showcasing its main capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs) offer a promising alternative with global bidirectional encoding and decoupled generation steps. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of DLLMs across the software development lifecycle, including code generation, defect detection, and program repair. On a large-scale benchmark of 52,937 tasks, 7Bparameter DLLMs outperform AR-LLMs with a 30% average accuracy improvement achieving a 113% gain on cross-file repair, while maintaining superior efficiency and reduced latency. Our results establish DLLMs as a superior paradigm for SE tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, systematic measurement of governmental OSS adoption remain limited. Research Aim: This study contributes to digital government maturity indexes by analyzing policies and support actions leveraging OSS for software reuse and collaborative development across 16 digitally mature countries, and proposing potential indicators for said indexes. It examines OSS policy formation, stated goals, key actors, and support mechanisms. Methodology: A qualitative approach is used combining desk research of policy documents with semi-structured interviews of government representatives, producing detailed country reports. These are cross-analyzed, focusing on OSS policy promotion, rationale, and implementation support. Results: Policies facilitating OSS reuse are widespread, targeting both inbound acquisition and outbound sharing, and are predominantly governed by central public sector organizations. Policy goals include interoperability, digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency, with security framed both as a risk and strength. Implementation is supported by diverse Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) at multiple government levels, which foster capacity building, resource pooling, and sustainable project governance. Indicators are synthesized and proposed across 14 areas covering policy incentives and design, and implementation and support. Conclusions: OSS is a strategic enabler for public sector digital transformation. Clear policy frameworks, coupled with institutional support such as OSPOs, are essential. International digital maturity frameworks should expand OSS indicators to better guide and assess government adoption and impact.</p></details> | In submission |

When the codomain of $f$ is equipped with a total order, it is easy to specify, implement, and verify generic solutions to this problem. But what if $f$ is affected by uncertainties? What if one seeks values that minimize more than one objective, or if $f$ does not return a single result but a set of possible results, or even a probability distribution? Such situations are common in climate science, economics, and engineering. Developing trustworthy solution methods for optimization under uncertainty requires formulating and answering these questions rigorously, including deciding which order relations to apply in different cases. We show how functional programming can support this task, and apply it to specify and test solution methods for cases where optimization is affected by two conceptually different kinds of uncertainty: value and functorial uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Programming the software for such systems remains a largely manual and tedious process, incurring costs of millions of dollars for extensive facilities. Large language models (LLMs) have been found helpful in generating DCS control logic, resulting in commercial copilot tools. Today, these tools are focused on textual notations, they provide limited automation, and have not been tested on large datasets with realistic test cases. We introduce Spec2Control, a highly automated LLM workflow to generate graphical control logic directly from natural language user requirements. Experiments using an open dataset with 10 control narratives and 65 complex test cases demonstrate that Spec2Control can successfully identify control strategies, can generate 98.6% of correct control strategy connections autonomously, and can save between 94-96% of human labor. Spec2Control is being integrated into commercial ABB engineering tools, but is also available as an open-source variant for independent validation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Unlike most existing approaches that treat individual seeds as tasks, DynamiQ leverages structural information from the program's call graph to define tasks and continuously refines task allocation using runtime feedback. This design significantly reduces redundant exploration and enhances fuzzing efficiency at scale. Built on top of the state-of-the-art LibAFL framework, DynamiQ incorporates several practical optimizations in both task allocation and task-aware fuzzing. Evaluated on 12 real-world targets from OSS-Fuzz and FuzzBench over 25,000 CPU hours, DynamiQ outperforms state-of-the-art parallel fuzzers in both code coverage and vulnerability discovery, uncovering 9 previously unknown bugs in widely used and extensively fuzzed open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving IR-based Bug Localization with Semantics-Driven Query Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04468v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of research, software bug localization remains challenging due to heterogeneous content and inherent ambiguities in bug reports. Existing methods such as Information Retrieval (IR)-based approaches often attempt to match source documents to bug reports, overlooking the context and semantics of the source code. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g., Transformer models) show promising results in understanding both texts and code. However, they have not been yet adapted well to localize software bugs against bug reports. They could be also data or resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we propose, IQLoc, a novel bug localization approach that capitalizes on the strengths of both IR and LLM-based approaches. In particular, we leverage the program semantics understanding of transformer-based models to reason about the suspiciousness of code and reformulate queries during bug localization using Information Retrieval. To evaluate IQLoc, we refine the Bench4BL benchmark dataset and extend it by incorporating ~30% more recent bug reports, resulting in a benchmark containing ~7.5K bug reports. We evaluated IQLoc using three performance metrics and compare it against four baseline techniques. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority, achieving up to 58.52% and 60.59% in MAP, 61.49% and 64.58% in MRR, and 69.88% and 100.90% in HIT@K for the test bug reports with random and time-wise splits, respectively. Moreover, IQLoc improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces, 72.73% for those that include code elements, and 65.38% for those containing only descriptions in natural language. By integrating program semantic understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc mitigates several longstanding challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Despite promising results, most existing methods are limited to a single programming language. This is problematic given the multilingual nature of modern software, which is often complex and written in multiple languages. Current approaches often face challenges in capturing both shared and language-specific knowledge of source code, which can limit their performance on diverse programming languages and real-world codebases. To address this gap, we propose MULVULN, a novel multilingual vulnerability detection approach that learns from source code across multiple languages. MULVULN captures both the shared knowledge that generalizes across languages and the language-specific knowledge that reflects unique coding conventions. By integrating these aspects, it achieves more robust and effective detection of vulnerabilities in real-world multilingual software systems. The rigorous and extensive experiments on the real-world and diverse REEF dataset, consisting of 4,466 CVEs with 30,987 patches across seven programming languages, demonstrate the superiority of MULVULN over thirteen effective and state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, MULVULN achieves substantially higher F1-score, with improvements ranging from 1.45% to 23.59% compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

MacroBench instantiates seven self-hosted sites: Airbnb-like, TikTok-like, Reddit-like, Instagram-like, Facebook-like, Discord-like, and Threads-like, covering 681 tasks across interaction complexity and targeting difficulty. Our end-to-end protocol validates generated code via static checks, sandboxed execution, and outcome verification including DOM assertions and database snapshots, and includes a safety suite for scraping, spam/abuse, and credential/privacy prompts. Across 2636 model-task runs, we observe stratified success: GPT-4o-Mini achieves 96.8 percent, GPT-4.1 achieves 95.3 percent, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves 89.0 percent, and DeepSeek-V3.1 achieves 83.4 percent. Models handle simple tasks reliably at 91.7 percent but fail on complex workflows at 0.0 percent, and none meet production-quality coding practices despite functional completion.

This challenge becomes particularly relevant as code agents become used to solve isolated one-off programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to refactor code in ways that support growth and reusability. We first investigate what makes a good refactoring, finding via simulation results and a human study that Minimum Description Length best correlates with preferable refactorings. We then present both a benchmark and a method for refactoring: MiniCode, a benchmark where multiple files must be refactored into a shared library, and Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method for generating reusable libraries. We compare Librarian to state-of-the-art library generation methods, and study it on real-world code bases.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Multi Language Models for On-the-Fly Syntax Highlighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04166v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Syntax highlighting is a critical feature in modern software development environments, enhancing code readability and developer productivity. However, delivering accurate highlighting in real time remains challenging for online and web-based development tools due to strict time and memory constraints on backend services. These systems must serve highlights rapidly and frequently, even when code is partially valid or invalid. This has led to on-the-fly syntax highlighting, where visual annotations are generated just before content is served, often at high request rates and under incomplete input conditions. To meet these demands efficiently, state-of-the-art models use deep learning to learn the behavior of brute-force syntax highlighting resolvers, tools that are easy to implement but too slow for production. Through the Deep Abstraction process, brute-force strategies are encoded into fast statistical models that achieve both high accuracy and low-latency inference. Despite their success, such models face key challenges: they support only one programming language per model, require large datasets from slow brute-force generators, and involve resource-intensive training. In multi-language environments, this means maintaining multiple independent models, increasing system complexity and operational cost. This work addresses these issues by introducing a unified model capable of highlighting up to six mainstream programming languages, reducing deployment complexity by a factor of six and improving performance on unseen languages. A novel normalization technique significantly enhances model generalization, while few-shot learning experiments show that a small number of oracle samples can replace large datasets, minimizing dependence on brute-force generators. Combined, these innovations enable efficient, scalable, and cost-effective syntax highlighting across diverse programming languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refactoring with LLMs: Bridging Human Expertise and Machine Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03914v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code refactoring is a fundamental software engineering practice aimed at improving code quality and maintainability. Despite its importance, developers often neglect refactoring due to the significant time, effort, and resources it requires, as well as the lack of immediate functional rewards. Although several automated refactoring tools have been proposed, they remain limited in supporting a broad spectrum of refactoring types. In this study, we explore whether instruction strategies inspired by human best-practice guidelines can enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform diverse refactoring tasks automatically. Leveraging the instruction-following and code comprehension capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-mini and DeepSeek-V3), we draw on Martin Fowler's refactoring guidelines to design multiple instruction strategies that encode motivations, procedural steps, and transformation objectives for 61 well-known refactoring types. We evaluate these strategies on benchmark examples and real-world code snippets from GitHub projects. Our results show that instruction designs grounded in Fowler's guidelines enable LLMs to successfully perform all benchmark refactoring types and preserve program semantics in real-world settings, an essential criterion for effective refactoring. Moreover, while descriptive instructions are more interpretable to humans, our results show that rule-based instructions often lead to better performance in specific scenarios. Interestingly, allowing models to focus on the overall goal of refactoring, rather than prescribing a fixed transformation type, can yield even greater improvements in code quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Existing approaches for C to safe Rust translation, including LLM-assisted ones, do not generalize on larger (> 500 LoC) C codebases because they depend on complex program analyses that frequently break. In this work, we present ACToR (Adversarial C To Rust translator), a simple LLM agent-based approach. Inspired by GANs, ACToR pits a generator agent against a discriminator agent, which collaborate to iteratively generate a Rust translation. On each iteration, the translator agent synthesizes and refines a Rust translation to pass an existing suite of tests, and then the discriminator agent finds new failing tests. We demonstrate that ACToR translates all of the 63 real-world command line utilities considered in our benchmarks, which have an average size of 485 lines of code, and it achieves over 90% test pass rate with zero human intervention. To our knowledge, it is the first such system that reliably translates C programs of this scale. Furthermore, ACToR improves translation correctness by up to 18.9% compared to baseline, non-adversarial approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[REFINE: Enhancing Program Repair Agents through Context-Aware Patch Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03588v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in automatic program repair (APR), especially in repository-level settings where the goal is to generate patches based on natural language issue descriptions, large codebases, and regression tests. However, despite their promise, current LLM-based APR techniques often struggle to produce correct fixes due to limited understanding of code context and over-reliance on incomplete test suites. As a result, they frequently generate Draft Patches-partially correct patches that either incompletely address the bug or overfit to the test cases. In this work, we propose a novel patch refinement framework, Refine, that systematically transforms Draft Patches into correct ones. Refine addresses three key challenges: disambiguating vague issue and code context, diversifying patch candidates through test-time scaling, and aggregating partial fixes via an LLM-powered code review process. We implement Refine as a general refinement module that can be integrated into both open-agent-based and workflow-based APR systems. Our evaluation on the SWE-Bench Lite benchmark shows that Refine achieves state-of-the-art results among workflow-based approaches and approaches the best-known performance across all APR categories. Specifically, Refine boosts AutoCodeRover's performance by 14.67%, achieving a score of 51.67% and surpassing all prior baselines. On SWE-Bench Verified, Refine improves the resolution rate by 12.2%, and when integrated across multiple APR systems, it yields an average improvement of 14%-demonstrating its broad effectiveness and generalizability. These results highlight the effectiveness of refinement as a missing component in current APR pipelines and the potential of agentic collaboration in closing the gap between near-correct and correct patches.

| **[Formal Analysis of Metastable Failures in Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03551v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale software systems demonstrate metastable failures. In this class of failures, a stressor such as a temporary spike in workload causes the system performance to drop and, subsequently, the system performance continues to remain low even when the stressor is removed. These failures have been reported by many large corporations and considered to be a rare but catastrophic source of availability outages in cloud systems. In this paper, we provide the mathematical foundations of metastability in request-response server systems. We model such systems using a domain-specific language. We show how to construct continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) that approximate the semantics of the programs through modeling and data-driven calibration. We use the structure of the CTMC models to provide a visualization of the qualitative behavior of the model. The visualization is a surprisingly effective way to identify system parameterizations that cause a system to show metastable behaviors. We complement the qualitative analysis with quantitative predictions. We provide a formal notion of metastable behaviors based on escape probabilities, and show that metastable behaviors are related to the eigenvalue structure of the CTMC. Our characterization leads to algorithmic tools to predict recovery times in metastable models of server systems. We have implemented our technique in a tool for the modeling and analysis of server systems. Through models inspired by failures in real request-response systems, we show that our qualitative visual analysis captures and predicts many instances of metastability that were observed in the field in a matter of milliseconds. Our algorithms confirm that recovery times surge as the system parameters approach metastable modes in the dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repairing Leaks in Resource Wrappers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03461v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A resource leak occurs when a program fails to release a finite resource like a socket, file descriptor or database connection. While sound static analysis tools can detect all leaks, automatically repairing them remains challenging. Prior work took the output of a detection tool and attempted to repair only leaks from a hard-coded list of library resource types. That approach limits the scope of repairable leaks: real-world code uses resource wrappers that store a resource in a field and must themselves be closed. This paper makes four key contributions to improve resource leak repair in the presence of wrappers. (1) It integrates inference of resource management specifications into the repair pipeline, enabling extant fixing approaches to reason about wrappers. (2) It transforms programs into variants that are easier to analyze, making inference, detection, and fixing tools more effective; for instance, it makes detection tools report problems closer to the root cause, often in a client of a resource wrapper rather than within the wrapper class itself. (3) A novel field containment analysis reasons about resource lifetimes, enabling repair of more leaks involving resources stored in fields. (4) It introduces a new repair pattern and more precise reasoning to better handle resources stored in non-final fields. Prior work fixed 41% of resource leak warnings in the NJR benchmark suite; our implementation Arodnap fixes 68%.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLSEMANTICSBENCH: Large Language Models As Programming Language Interpreters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03415v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) excel at code reasoning, a natural question arises: can an LLM execute programs (i.e., act as an interpreter) purely based on a programming language's formal semantics? If so, it will enable rapid prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs could serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of their robust semantics understanding. We release the benchmark and the supporting code at https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/PLSemanticsBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstain and Validate: A Dual-LLM Policy for Reducing Noise in Agentic Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03217v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex, repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise, wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports, patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale deployment of agentic APR systems.</p></details> |  |

However, randomized mutation strategies have limited the fuzzer's performance on structured data. Specialized fuzzers can handle complex structured data, but require additional efforts in grammar and suffer from low throughput. In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing the Large Language Model to enhance greybox fuzzing for structured data. We utilize the pre-trained knowledge of LLM about data conversion and format to generate new valid inputs. We further fine-tuned it with paired mutation seeds to learn structured format and mutation strategies effectively. Our LLM-based fuzzer, LLAMAFUZZ, integrates the power of LLM to understand and mutate structured data to fuzzing. We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a wide variety of real-world programs. LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor by 41 bugs on average. We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials. Moreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and bug reached. Compared to AFL++, LLAMAFUZZ achieved 27.19% more branches in real-world program sets on average. We also demonstrate a case study to explain how LLMs enhance the fuzzing process in terms of code coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[When Names Disappear: Revealing What LLMs Actually Understand About Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03178v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code understanding and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Contract Intent Detection with Pre-trained Programming Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20086v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious developer intents in smart contracts constitute significant security threats to decentralized applications, leading to substantial economic losses. To address this, SmartIntentNN was previously introduced as a deep learning model for detecting unsafe developer intents. By combining the Universal Sentence Encoder, a K-means clustering-based intent highlighting mechanism, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, the model achieved an F1 score of 0.8633 on an evaluation set of 10,000 real-world smart contracts across ten distinct intent categories. In this study, we present an enhanced version of this model, SmartIntentNN2 (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network V2). The primary enhancement is the integration of a BERT-based pre-trained programming language model, which we domain-adaptively pre-train on a dataset of 16,000 real-world smart contracts using a Masked Language Modeling objective. SmartIntentNN2 retains the BiLSTM-based multi-label classification network for intent detection. On the same evaluation set of 10,000 smart contracts, SmartIntentNN2 achieves superior performance with an accuracy of 0.9789, precision of 0.9090, recall of 0.9476, and an F1 score of 0.9279, substantially outperforming its predecessor and other baseline models. Notably, SmartIntentNN2 also delivers a 65.5% relative improvement in F1 score over GPT-4.1 on this specialized task. These results establish SmartIntentNN2 as a new state-of-the-art model for smart contract intent detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Investigating The Smells of LLM Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03029v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate program code. Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of generated code, but there is far less on code quality. Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating the quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which the quality of LLM generated code should be improved. Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code quality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of professionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets according to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to represent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also present an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with the Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon. Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code smells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with a smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%) and finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was 63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design smells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more complex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving object-orientated concepts. Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding task complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human written code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM generated code is noticeably poorer than human written code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing repository-level software repair via repository-aware knowledge graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21710v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level software repair faces challenges in bridging semantic gaps between issue descriptions and code patches. Existing approaches, which primarily rely on large language models (LLMs), are hindered by semantic ambiguities, limited understanding of structural context, and insufficient reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose KGCompass with two innovations: (1) a novel repository-aware knowledge graph (KG) that accurately links repository artifacts (issues and pull requests) and codebase entities (files, classes, and functions), allowing us to effectively narrow down the vast search space to only 20 most relevant functions with accurate candidate fault locations and contextual information, and (2) a path-guided repair mechanism that leverages KG-mined entity paths, tracing through which allows us to augment LLMs with relevant contextual information to generate precise patches along with their explanations. Experimental results in the SWE-bench Lite demonstrate that KGCompass achieves state-of-the-art single-LLM repair performance (58.3%) and function-level fault location accuracy (56.0%) across open-source approaches with a single repair model, costing only $0.2 per repair. Among the bugs that KGCompass successfully localizes, 89.7% lack explicit location hints in the issue and are found only through multi-hop graph traversal, where pure LLMs struggle to locate bugs accurately. Relative to pure-LLM baselines, KGCompass lifts the resolved rate by 50.8% on Claude-4 Sonnet, 30.2% on Claude-3.5 Sonnet, 115.7% on DeepSeek-V3, and 156.4% on Qwen2.5 Max. These consistent improvements demonstrate that this graph-guided repair framework delivers model-agnostic, cost-efficient repair and sets a strong new baseline for repository-level repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[C2|Q>: A Robust Framework for Bridging Classical and Quantum Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02854v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging as a critical discipline to make quantum computing accessible to a broader developer community; however, most quantum development environments still require developers to engage with low-level details across the software stack - including problem encoding, circuit construction, algorithm configuration, hardware selection, and result interpretation - making them difficult for classical software engineers to use. To bridge this gap, we present C2|Q>: a hardware-agnostic quantum software development framework that translates classical specifications (code) into quantum-executable programs while preserving methodological rigor. The framework applies modular software engineering principles by classifying the workflow into three core modules: an encoder that classifies problems, produces Quantum-Compatible Formats (QCFs), and constructs quantum circuits, a deployment module that generates circuits and recommends hardware based on fidelity, runtime, and cost, and a decoder that interprets quantum outputs into classical solutions. In evaluation, the encoder module achieved a 93.8% completion rate, the hardware recommendation module consistently selected the appropriate quantum devices for workloads scaling up to 56 qubits, and the full C2|Q>: workflow successfully processed classical specifications (434 Python snippets and 100 JSON inputs) with completion rates of 93.8% and 100%, respectively. For case study problems executed on publicly available NISQ hardware, C2|Q>: reduced the required implementation effort by nearly 40X compared to manual implementations using low-level quantum software development kits (SDKs), with empirical runs limited to small- and medium-sized instances consistent with current NISQ capabilities. The open-source implementation of C2|Q>: is available at https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 8 images, 14 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

Despite its widespread adoption, critical security bugs in OpenID Connect have resulted in significant financial losses and security breaches, highlighting the need for robust mitigation strategies. Automated program repair presents a promising solution for generating candidate patches for OpenID implementations. However, challenges such as domain-specific complexities and the necessity for precise fault localization and patch verification must be addressed. We propose AuthFix, a counterexample-guided repair engine leveraging LLMs for automated OpenID bug fixing. AuthFix integrates three key components: fault localization, patch synthesis, and patch verification. By employing a novel Petri-net-based model checker, AuthFix ensures the correctness of patches by effectively modeling interactions. Our evaluation on a dataset of OpenID bugs demonstrates that AuthFix successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs (74%), with a high proportion of patches semantically equivalent to developer-written fixes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version.

It therefore remains unclear whether such generalist agents can automate more sophisticated and specialized work such as software engineering (SWE). To investigate this, we introduce $\texttt{Programming with Pixels}$ (PwP), the first comprehensive computer-use environment for software engineering, where agents visually control an IDE to perform diverse software engineering tasks. To enable holistic evaluation, we also introduce \texttt{PwP-Bench}, a benchmark of 15 existing and new software-engineering tasks spanning multiple modalities, programming languages, and skillsets. We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-weight and closed-weight CUAs and find that when interacting purely visually, they perform significantly worse than specialized coding agents. However, when the same CUAs are given direct access to just two APIs-file editing and bash operations-performance jumps, often reaching the levels of specialized agents despite having a task-agnostic design. Furthermore, when given access to additional IDE tools via text APIs, all models show further gains. Our analysis shows that current CUAs fall short mainly due to limited visual grounding and the inability to take full advantage of the rich environment, leaving clear room for future improvements.PwP establishes software engineering as a natural domain for benchmarking whether generalist computer-use agents can reach specialist-level performance on sophisticated tasks.

| **[Analyzing Latent Concepts in Code Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00476v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting the internal behavior of large language models trained on code remains a critical challenge, particularly for applications demanding trust, transparency, and semantic robustness. We propose Code Concept Analysis (CoCoA): a global post-hoc interpretability framework that uncovers emergent lexical, syntactic, and semantic structures in a code language model's representation space by clustering contextualized token embeddings into human-interpretable concept groups. We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines static analysis tool-based syntactic alignment with prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), enabling scalable labeling of latent concepts across abstraction levels. We analyse the distribution of concepts across layers and across three finetuning tasks. Emergent concept clusters can help identify unexpected latent interactions and be used to identify trends and biases within the model's learned representations. We further integrate LCA with local attribution methods to produce concept-grounded explanations, improving the coherence and interpretability of token-level saliency. Empirical evaluations across multiple models and tasks show that LCA discovers concepts that remain stable under semantic-preserving perturbations (average Cluster Sensitivity Index, CSI = 0.288) and evolve predictably with fine-tuning. In a user study on the programming-language classification task, concept-augmented explanations disambiguated token roles and improved human-centric explainability by 37 percentage points compared with token-level attributions using Integrated Gradients.</p></details> |  |
| **[RedCodeAgent: Automatic Red-teaming Agent against Diverse Code Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02609v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.</p></details> |  |

Pluggable type systems are difficult to deploy in legacy codebases because they require programmers to write type annotations manually. This paper investigates how to use machine learning to infer type qualifiers automatically. We propose a novel representation, NaP-AST, that encodes minimal dataflow hints for the effective inference of type qualifiers. We evaluate several model architectures for inferring type qualifiers, including Graph Transformer Network, Graph Convolutional Network and Large Language Model. We further validated these models by applying them to 12 open-source programs from a prior evaluation of the NullAway pluggable typechecker, lowering warnings in all but one unannotated project. We discovered that GTN shows the best performance, with a recall of .89 and precision of 0.6. Furthermore, we conduct a study to estimate the number of Java classes needed for good performance of the trained model. For our feasibility study, performance improved around 16k classes, and deteriorated due to overfitting around 22k classes.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained, semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation. Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Besides offering a programmatic API for these functionalities, LitterBox+ also extends the Scratch user interface to make these functionalities available directly in the environment familiar to learners. The framework is designed to be easily extensible with other prompts, LLM providers, and new features combining the program analysis capabilities of LitterBox with the generative features of LLMs. We provide a screencast demonstrating the tool at https://youtu.be/RZ6E0xgrIgQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 Tool Demonstration Track</p></details> |

However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips, are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification. More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural communities.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers, which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target function. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models to automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly structured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system and the team. This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First, constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a function's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether reported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents. Our results highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing pipelines.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Simultaneously, advances in cloud-native development practices have greatly enhanced the development experience and facilitated quicker updates, thereby enhancing application security. However, applying these advances to IoT, edge, and embedded devices remains a complex task, primarily due to the heterogeneous environments and the need to support devices with extended lifespans. WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) has emerged as a promising technology to bridge this gap. As WebAssembly becomes more popular on IoT, edge, and embedded devices, there is a growing demand for hardware interface support in WebAssembly programs. This work presents WASI proposals and proof-of-concept implementations to enable hardware interaction with I2C and USB, which are two commonly used protocols in IoT, directly from WebAssembly applications. This is achieved by running the device drivers within WebAssembly as well. A thorough evaluation of the proof of concepts shows that WASI-USB introduces a minimal overhead of at most 8% compared to native operating system USB APIs. However, the results show that runtime initialization overhead can be significant in low-latency applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted article of the IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium 2025 (NOMS 2025)</p></details> |

This challenge, also known as reoptimisation, has been addressed in various problem domains, such as railway crew rescheduling, nurse rerostering, or aircraft recovery. This requires a modified problem to be solved again to ensure that the adapted solution is optimal in the new context. However, the new optimisation problem differs notably from the original problem: (i) we want to make only minimal changes to the original solution to minimise the impact; (ii) we may be unable to change some parts of the original solution (e.g., because they refer to past allocations); and (iii) we need to derive a change script from the original solution to the new solution. In this paper, we argue that Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) - in particular, the use of declarative modelling languages and model transformations for the high-level specification of optimisation problems - offers new opportunities for the systematic derivation of reoptimisation problems from the original optimisation problem specification. We focus on combinatorial reoptimisation problems and provide an initial categorisation of changing problems and strategies for deriving the corresponding reoptimisation specifications. We introduce an initial proof-of-concept implementation based on the GIPS (Graph-Based (Mixed) Integer Linear Programming Problem Specification) tool and apply it to an example resource-allocation problem: the allocation of teaching assistants to teaching sessions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clarifying Semantics of In-Context Examples for Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01994v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled promising performance in unit test generation through in-context learning (ICL). However, the quality of in-context examples significantly influences the effectiveness of generated tests-poorly structured or semantically unclear test examples often lead to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose CLAST, a novel technique that systematically refines unit tests to improve their semantic clarity, thereby enhancing their utility as in-context examples. The approach decomposes complex tests into logically clearer ones and improves semantic clarity through a combination of program analysis and LLM-based rewriting. We evaluated CLAST on four open-source and three industrial projects. The results demonstrate that CLAST largely outperforms UTgen, the state-of-the-art refinement technique, in both preserving test effectiveness and enhancing semantic clarity. Specifically, CLAST fully retains the original effectiveness of unit tests, while UTgen reduces compilation success rate (CSR), pass rate (PR), test coverage (Cov), and mutation score (MS) by an average of 12.90%, 35.82%, 4.65%, and 5.07%, respectively. Over 85.33% of participants in our user study preferred the semantic clarity of CLAST-refined tests. Notably, incorporating CLAST-refined tests as examples effectively improves ICL-based unit test generation approaches such as RAGGen and TELPA, resulting in an average increase of 25.97% in CSR, 28.22% in PR, and 45.99% in Cov for generated tests, compared to incorporating UTgen-refined tests. The insights from the follow-up user study not only reinforce CLAST's potential impact in software testing practice but also illuminate avenues for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in the research track of ASE 2025</p></details> |

We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Speeding up Program Repair with Non-Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01825v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enlightened by the success of machine learning techniques in various application areas, recent years have witnessed a surge of research efforts on automatic program repair (APR) using machine learning techniques. Previous machine learning-based APR techniques essentially modified bugs in the autoregressive (AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values. Due to the manner of token-by-token generation, the AR-based APR technique has a huge time delay. In particular, the delay of the APR model with a large number of parameters is more serious. To address the issue, we aim to apply the non-autoregressive (NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code in a parallel manner to avoid huge repair delays. However, the naive use of the NAR manner for the APR task suffers from the issue of compromised patch quality. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper propose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR task. The NARRepair model features three major novelties, including 1) the repair action predictor for alleviating the over-correction issue, 2) the inter-token dependency extractor for alleviating the issue of lacking inter-token dependency information, and 3) the two-stage decoder for alleviating the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair on three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that 1) compared to other APR techniques, the NARRepair model has the best performance within the limited repair time, and 2) compared to AR-based APR techniques, the repair speed of NARRepair has been increased by 1.4-6.4 times in the GPU environment. Overall, the results show that NARRepair has achieved state-of-the-art comprehensive performance in terms of repair speed and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.16526</p></details> |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging approach should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with the tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Discovering Software Parallelization Points Using Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16215v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for discovering loops in programming code according to their potential for parallelization. Two genetic algorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of code: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous loops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the loop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and preprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were implemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a robust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of both models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance, but the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset sizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the identification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool for software optimization and performance improvement.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Beyond Single LLMs: Enhanced Code Generation via Multi-Stage Performance-Guided LLM Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01379v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. This paper challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage, performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using HumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization, and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language, development stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37% on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and 49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional fault analysis, while valuable, typically involves multiple expert-driven steps such as collecting potential faults, filtering, and manual investigation. These processes are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks that hinder large-scale fault studies in complex yet critical software systems and slow the pace of iterative empirical research. In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation, and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software. Specifically, we perform the evaluation on 3,829 software faults drawn from a high-quality empirical study. Our results show that LLMs can substantially improve efficiency in fault analysis, with an average processing time of about two hours, compared to the weeks of manual effort typically required. We conclude by outlining a detailed research plan that highlights both the potential of LLMs for advancing empirical fault studies and the open challenges that required be addressed to achieve fully automated, end-to-end software fault analysis.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Academic research, industrial projects (e.g., Amazon Braket, IBM Qiskit), and consortiums like 'Quantum Flagship' are striving to develop practically capable and commercially viable quantum computing (QC) systems and technologies. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is viewed as a solution attuned to the philosophy of service-orientation that can offer QC resources and platforms, as utility computing, to individuals and organisations who do not own quantum computers. This research investigates a process-centric and architecture-driven approach to offer a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS - a.k.a quantum service-orientation. We employed a two-phase research method comprising (a) a systematic mapping study and (b) an architecture-based development, first to identify the phases of the quantum service development life cycle and subsequently to integrate these phases into a reference architecture that supports QCaaS. The SMS process retrieved a collection of potentially relevant research literature and based on a multi-step selection and qualitative assessment, we selected 41 peer-reviewed studies to answer three RQs. The RQs investigate (i) demographic details in terms of frequency, types, and trends of research, (ii) phases of quantum service development lifecycle to derive a reference architecture for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of services, and (iii) The results identify a 4-phased development lifecycle along with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations, catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can be integrated in a layered reference architecture to engineer QCaaS.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 10 images, 5 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Why Software Signing (Still) Matters: Trust Boundaries in the Software Supply Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04964v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software signing provides a formal mechanism for provenance by ensuring artifact integrity and verifying producer identity. It also imposes tooling and operational costs to implement in practice. In an era of centralized registries such as PyPI, npm, Maven Central, and Hugging Face, it is reasonable to ask whether hardening registry security controls obviates the need for end-to-end artifact signing. In this work, we posit that the core guarantees of signing, provenance, integrity, and accountability are not automatically carried across different software distribution boundaries. These boundaries include mirrors, corporate proxies, re-hosting, and air-gapped transfers, where registry security controls alone cannot provide sufficient assurance. We synthesize historical practice and present a trust model for modern distribution modes to identify when signing is necessary to extend trust beyond registry control. Treating signing as a baseline layer of defense strengthens software supply chain assurance even when registries are secure.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 3 Figures |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation: A Survey with Focus on Repository-Level Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04905v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved automated code generation. While function-level and file-level generation have achieved promising results, real-world software development typically requires reasoning across entire repositories. This gives rise to the challenging task of Repository-Level Code Generation (RLCG), where models must capture long-range dependencies, ensure global semantic consistency, and generate coherent code spanning multiple files or modules. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that integrates external retrieval mechanisms with LLMs, enhancing context-awareness and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research on Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), with an emphasis on repository-level approaches. We categorize existing work along several dimensions, including generation strategies, retrieval modalities, model architectures, training paradigms, and evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we summarize widely used datasets and benchmarks, analyze current limitations, and outline key challenges and opportunities for future research. Our goal is to establish a unified analytical framework for understanding this rapidly evolving field and to inspire continued progress in AI-powered software engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the sheer volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort.

| **[Retrofitting Control Flow Graphs in LLVM IR for Auto Vectorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04890v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern processors increasingly rely on SIMD instruction sets, such as AVX and RVV, to significantly enhance parallelism and computational performance. However, production-ready compilers like LLVM and GCC often fail to fully exploit available vectorization opportunities due to disjoint vectorization passes and limited extensibility. Although recent attempts in heuristics and intermediate representation (IR) designs have attempted to address these problems, efficiently simplifying control flow analysis and accurately identifying vectorization opportunities remain challenging tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a novel vectorization pipeline featuring two specialized IR extensions: SIR, which encodes high-level structural information, and VIR, which explicitly represents instruction dependencies through data dependency analysis. Leveraging the detailed dependency information provided by VIR, we develop a flexible and extensible vectorization framework. This approach substantially improves interoperability across vectorization passes and expands the search space for identifying isomorphic instructions, ultimately enhancing both the scope and efficiency of automatic vectorization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed vectorization pipeline achieves significant performance improvements, delivering speedups of up to 53% and 58% compared to LLVM and GCC, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, interaction challenges with CCTs persist, mainly due to mismatches between developers' mental models and the unpredictable behavior of AI-generated suggestions, which is an aspect underexplored in the literature. We conducted an elicitation study with 56 developers using co-design workshops to elicit their mental models when interacting with CCTs. Different important findings that might drive the interaction design with CCTs emerged. For example, developers expressed diverse preferences on when and how code suggestions should be triggered (proactive, manual, hybrid), where and how they are displayed (inline, sidebar, popup, chatbot), as well as the level of detail. It also emerged that developers need to be supported by customization of activation timing, display modality, suggestion granularity, and explanation content, to better fit the CCT to their preferences. To demonstrate the feasibility of these and the other guidelines that emerged during the study, we developed ATHENA, a proof-of-concept CCT that dynamically adapts to developers' coding preferences and environments, ensuring seamless integration into diverse workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreshBrew: A Benchmark for Evaluating AI Agents on Java Code Migration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04852v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding assistants are rapidly becoming integral to modern software development. A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

Existing approaches have shown promise in automatically recovering these links. Evaluations of these techniques assess their ability to identify genuine links from plausible but false links. However, these evaluations overlook the fact that, in reality, when a repository has more commits, the presence of more plausible yet unrelated commits may interfere with the tool in differentiating the correct fix commits. To address this, we propose the Realistic Distribution Setting (RDS) and use it to construct a more realistic evaluation dataset that includes 20 open-source projects. By evaluating tools on this dataset, we observe that the performance of the state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach drops by more than half, while the traditional Information Retrieval method, VSM, outperforms it. Inspired by these observations, we propose EasyLink, which utilizes a vector database as a modern Information Retrieval technique. To address the long-standing problem of the semantic gap between issues and commits, EasyLink leverages a large language model to rerank the commits retrieved from the database. Under our evaluation, EasyLink achieves an average Precision@1 of 75.03\%, improving over the state-of-the-art by over four times. Additionally, this paper provides practical guidelines for advancing research in issue-commit link recovery.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in fuzzing techniques, such as coverage-guided greybox fuzzing, many fuzzers struggle with coverage plateaus caused by fuzz blockers, limiting their ability to find deeper vulnerabilities. Human expertise can address these challenges, but analyzing fuzzing results to guide this support remains labor-intensive. To tackle this, we introduce InsightQL, the first human-assisting framework for fuzz blocker analysis. Powered by a unified database and an intuitive parameterized query interface, InsightQL aids developers in systematically extracting insights and efficiently unblocking fuzz blockers. Our experiments on 14 popular real-world libraries from the FuzzBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of InsightQL, leading to the unblocking of many fuzz blockers and considerable improvements in code coverage (up to 13.90%).</p></details> |  |

However, little attention has been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of software in research activities. Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences. Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices. However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse documentation practices. To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability, consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to address its heterogeneity and scale. This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the Life Sciences. We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard, examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting and analyzing review data remains a time-consuming and technically intensive task. Most researchers follow similar workflows - writing ad hoc scripts to extract, filter, and analyze review data from platforms like GitHub and GitLab. This paper introduces RevMine, a conceptual tool that streamlines the entire code review mining pipeline using large language models (LLMs). RevMine guides users through authentication, endpoint discovery, and natural language-driven data collection, significantly reducing the need for manual scripting. After retrieving review data, it supports both quantitative and qualitative analysis based on user-defined filters or LLM-inferred patterns. This poster outlines the tool's architecture, use cases, and research potential. By lowering the barrier to entry, RevMine aims to democratize code review mining and enable a broader range of empirical software engineering studies.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring that GUI implementations fulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering, especially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into development workflows. Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or LLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces, and typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated development agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework that leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification of NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to interpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and execute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector systematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification process, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to iteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code generation in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that unifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for supervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the end-to-end requirements verification process. We evaluated GUISpector on a comprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria annotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection of requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for seamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven development workflows. The video presentation of GUISpector is available at: https://youtu.be/JByYF6BNQeE, showcasing its main capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses that gap by focusing on Sinhala, a low-resource language with limited tools for linguistic accessibility. We present an assistive system explicitly designed for Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia. The system integrates Whisper for speech-to-text conversion, SinBERT, an open-sourced fine-tuned BERT model trained for Sinhala to identify common dyslexic errors, and a combined mT5 and Mistral-based model to generate corrected text. Finally, the output is converted back to speech using gTTS, creating a complete multimodal feedback loop. Despite the challenges posed by limited Sinhala-language datasets, the system achieves 0.66 transcription accuracy and 0.7 correction accuracy with 0.65 overall system accuracy.

Although many data-driven RCA models have been proposed, we find that existing benchmarks are often oversimplified and fail to capture real-world conditions. Our preliminary study shows that simple rule-based methods can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on four widely used benchmarks, suggesting performance overestimation due to benchmark simplicity. To address this, we systematically analyze popular RCA benchmarks and identify key limitations in fault injection, call graph design, and telemetry patterns. Based on these insights, we develop an automated framework to generate more realistic benchmarks, yielding a dataset of 1,430 validated failure cases from 9,152 injections, covering 25 fault types under dynamic workloads with hierarchical ground-truth labels and verified SLI impact.

| **[Evolaris: A Roadmap to Self-Evolving Software Intelligence Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04689v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the landscape of software threats has become significantly more dynamic and distributed. Security vulnerabilities are no longer discovered and shared only through formal channels such as public vulnerability databases or vendor advisories. Increasingly, criti- cal threat information emerges informally through blogs, social media, developer forums, open source repositories, and even underground com- munities. To this end, capturing such intelligence in a timely manner is essential for maintaining situational awareness and enabling prompt security responses. However, this remains a complex challenge due to the fragmented nature of data sources and the technical difficulty of collecting, parsing, mapping, and validating information at scale. To ad- dress this, we propose Evolaris, a self-evolving software intelligence sys- tem built on a multi-agent framework. Evolaris is designed to support a full-stack workflow, where agents operate independently but coordinate through shared context to perform tasks such as information discovery, reasoning, gap completion, validation, and risk detection. This archi- tecture enables the platform to learn from new inputs, refine its internal knowledge, and adapt to emerging threat patterns over time, which could continuously improve the precision, timeliness, and scalability of software threat analysis, and offers a sustainable foundation for proactive secu- rity decision-making and strengthens the broader ecosystem of security threat understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maven-Lockfile: High Integrity Rebuild of Past Java Releases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00730v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software projects depend on many third-party libraries, complicating reproducible and secure builds. Several package managers address this with the generation of a lockfile that freezes dependency versions and can be used to verify the integrity of dependencies. Yet, Maven, one of the most important package managers in the Java ecosystem, lacks native support for a lockfile. We present Maven-Lockfile to generate and update lockfiles, with support for rebuilding projects from past versions. Our lockfiles capture all direct and transitive dependencies with their checksums, enabling high integrity builds. Our evaluation shows that Maven-Lockfile can reproduce builds from historical commits and is able to detect tampered artifacts. With minimal configuration, Maven-Lockfile equips Java projects with modern build integrity and build reproducibility, and fosters future research on software supply chain security in Java.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test Schedule Generation for Acceptance Testing of Mission-Critical Satellite Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01224v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mission-critical system, such as satellite systems, healthcare systems, and nuclear power plant control systems, undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet specific operational requirements throughout their operation. This includes Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT), which aims to ensure that the system functions correctly under real-world operational conditions. In satellite development, In-Orbit Testing (IOT) is a crucial OAT activity performed regularly and as needed after deployment in orbit to check the satellite's performance and ensure that operational requirements are met. The scheduling of an IOT campaign, which executes multiple IOT procedures, is an important yet challenging problem, as it accounts for various factors, including satellite visibility, antenna usage costs, testing time periods, and operational constraints. To address the IOT scheduling problem, we propose a multi-objective approach to generate near-optimal IOT schedules, accounting for operational costs, fragmentation (i.e., the splitting of tests), and resource efficiency, which align with practitioners' objectives for IOT scheduling. Our industrial case study with SES Techcom shows significant improvements, as follows: an average improvement of 49.4% in the cost objective, 60.4% in the fragmentation objective, and 30% in the resource usage objective, compared to our baselines. Additionally, our approach improves cost efficiency by 538% and resource usage efficiency by 39.42% compared to manually constructed schedules provided by practitioners, while requiring only 12.5% of the time needed for manual IOT scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review (when applicable) or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[A survey on the impact of emotions on the productivity among software developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04611v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The time pressure associated with software development, among other factors, often leads to a diminished emotional state among developers. However, whether emotions affect perceived productivity remains an open question. This study aims to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between emotional state and perceived productivity among software developers. We employed a two-stage approach. First, a survey was conducted with a pool of nine experts to validate the measurement model. Second, a survey was administered to a pool of 88 software developers to empirically test the formulated hypothesis by using Partial Least Squares, as the data analysis method. The results of the path analysis clearly confirm the formulated hypothesis, showing that the emotional state of a software developer has a strong positive, and significant impact (beta = 0.893, p < 0.001) on perceived productivity among software developers. The findings highlight the importance of managing and improving developers emotional well-being to enhance productivity in software development environments. Additionally, interventions aimed at reducing burnout, stress, and other negative factors could have a considerable impact on their performance outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 tables, 96 references</p></details> |

Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs) offer a promising alternative with global bidirectional encoding and decoupled generation steps. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of DLLMs across the software development lifecycle, including code generation, defect detection, and program repair. On a large-scale benchmark of 52,937 tasks, 7Bparameter DLLMs outperform AR-LLMs with a 30% average accuracy improvement achieving a 113% gain on cross-file repair, while maintaining superior efficiency and reduced latency. Our results establish DLLMs as a superior paradigm for SE tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Digital Government: Integrating Open Source Software Enablement Indicators in Maturity Indexes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04603v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Open Source Software (OSS) is a vital public good, included across most of modern software stacks, significantly impacting GDP and national tech growth, while supporting interoperability, sovereignty, and transparency. However, systematic measurement of governmental OSS adoption remain limited. Research Aim: This study contributes to digital government maturity indexes by analyzing policies and support actions leveraging OSS for software reuse and collaborative development across 16 digitally mature countries, and proposing potential indicators for said indexes. It examines OSS policy formation, stated goals, key actors, and support mechanisms. Methodology: A qualitative approach is used combining desk research of policy documents with semi-structured interviews of government representatives, producing detailed country reports. These are cross-analyzed, focusing on OSS policy promotion, rationale, and implementation support. Results: Policies facilitating OSS reuse are widespread, targeting both inbound acquisition and outbound sharing, and are predominantly governed by central public sector organizations. Policy goals include interoperability, digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency, with security framed both as a risk and strength. Implementation is supported by diverse Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) at multiple government levels, which foster capacity building, resource pooling, and sustainable project governance. Indicators are synthesized and proposed across 14 areas covering policy incentives and design, and implementation and support. Conclusions: OSS is a strategic enabler for public sector digital transformation. Clear policy frameworks, coupled with institutional support such as OSPOs, are essential. International digital maturity frameworks should expand OSS indicators to better guide and assess government adoption and impact.</p></details> | In submission |

When the codomain of $f$ is equipped with a total order, it is easy to specify, implement, and verify generic solutions to this problem. But what if $f$ is affected by uncertainties? What if one seeks values that minimize more than one objective, or if $f$ does not return a single result but a set of possible results, or even a probability distribution? Such situations are common in climate science, economics, and engineering. Developing trustworthy solution methods for optimization under uncertainty requires formulating and answering these questions rigorously, including deciding which order relations to apply in different cases. We show how functional programming can support this task, and apply it to specify and test solution methods for cases where optimization is affected by two conceptually different kinds of uncertainty: value and functorial uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Programming the software for such systems remains a largely manual and tedious process, incurring costs of millions of dollars for extensive facilities. Large language models (LLMs) have been found helpful in generating DCS control logic, resulting in commercial copilot tools. Today, these tools are focused on textual notations, they provide limited automation, and have not been tested on large datasets with realistic test cases. We introduce Spec2Control, a highly automated LLM workflow to generate graphical control logic directly from natural language user requirements. Experiments using an open dataset with 10 control narratives and 65 complex test cases demonstrate that Spec2Control can successfully identify control strategies, can generate 98.6% of correct control strategy connections autonomously, and can save between 94-96% of human labor. Spec2Control is being integrated into commercial ABB engineering tools, but is also available as an open-source variant for independent validation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[DISC: Dynamic Decomposition Improves LLM Inference Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16706v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference scaling methods for LLMs often rely on decomposing problems into steps (or groups of tokens), followed by sampling and selecting the best next steps. However, these steps and their sizes are often predetermined or manually designed based on domain knowledge. We propose dynamic decomposition, a method that adaptively and automatically partitions solution and reasoning traces into manageable steps during inference. By more effectively allocating compute -- particularly through subdividing challenging steps and prioritizing their sampling -- dynamic decomposition significantly improves inference efficiency. Experiments on benchmarks such as APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that dynamic decomposition outperforms static approaches, including token-level, sentence-level, and single-step decompositions, reducing the pass@10 error rate by 5.0%, 6.7%, and 10.5% respectively. These findings highlight the potential of dynamic decomposition to improve a wide range of inference scaling techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)</p></details> |

The ability to reuse existing functionality via third-party dependencies has enabled massive gains in productivity, but for a long time the dominant philosophy has been to 'reuse as much as possible, without thought for what is being depended upon', creating fragile dependency chains. Heavy reliance has raised resiliency and maintenance concerns. In this vision paper, we investigate packages that challenge the typical concepts of reuse - that is, packages with no dependencies themselves that bear the responsibility of being at the end of the dependency supply chain. By avoiding dependencies, these packages at the end of the chain may also avoid the associated risks. Our initial analysis of the most depended upon NPM packages shows that such end-of-chain packages make up a significant portion of these critical dependency chain (over 50%). We find that these end-of-chain packages vary in characteristics and are not just packages that can be easily replaced, and present five cases. We then ask ourselves: Should maintainers minimize external dependencies? We argue that these packages reveal important lessons for strategic reuse-balancing the undeniable benefits of dependency ecosystems with sustainable, secure practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and presented at SE 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap Workshop.

| **[Detecting and Characterizing Low and No Functionality Packages in the NPM Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04495v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trivial packages, small modules with low functionality, are common in the npm ecosystem and can pose security risks despite their simplicity. This paper refines existing definitions and introduce data-only packages that contain no executable logic. A rule-based static analysis method is developed to detect trivial and data-only packages and evaluate their prevalence and associated risks in the 2025 npm ecosystem. The analysis shows that 17.92% of packages are trivial, with vulnerability levels comparable to non-trivial ones, and data-only packages, though rare, also contain risks. The proposed detection tool achieves 94% accuracy (macro-F1 0.87), enabling effective large-scale analysis to reduce security exposure. This findings suggest that trivial and data-only packages warrant greater attention in dependency management to reduce potential technical debt and security exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in PROFES 2025</p></details> |

Generated natural language code summaries aid comprehension but remain static and limited in supporting the full workflow. We present NaturalEdit, a system that makes code summaries interactive and adaptive representations directly linked to source code. Grounded in the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations, NaturalEdit implements a paradigm of code modification through interaction with natural language representations through three key features: (1) adaptive multi-faceted representation of code summaries with flexible Abstraction Gradient; (2) interactive mapping mechanisms between summaries and codes, ensuring a tight Closeness of Mapping; and (3) intent-driven, bidirectional synchronization that reduces Viscosity in editing and validation. A technical evaluation confirms the performance of NaturalEdit, and a user study with 12 developers shows that it enhances comprehension, intent articulation, and validation, giving developers greater confidence and control.</p></details> |  |

We present LogSage, the first end-to-end LLM-powered framework for root cause analysis (RCA) and automated remediation of CI/CD failures. LogSage employs a token-efficient log preprocessing pipeline to filter noise and extract critical errors, then performs structured diagnostic prompting for accurate RCA. For solution generation, it leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to reuse historical fixes and invokes automation fixes via LLM tool-calling. On a newly curated benchmark of 367 GitHub CI/CD failures, LogSage achieves over 98\% precision, near-perfect recall, and an F1 improvement of more than 38\% points in the RCA stage, compared with recent LLM-based baselines. In a year-long industrial deployment at ByteDance, it processed over 1.07M executions, with end-to-end precision exceeding 80\%. These results demonstrate that LogSage provides a scalable and practical solution for automating CI/CD failure management in real-world DevOps workflows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike most existing approaches that treat individual seeds as tasks, DynamiQ leverages structural information from the program's call graph to define tasks and continuously refines task allocation using runtime feedback. This design significantly reduces redundant exploration and enhances fuzzing efficiency at scale. Built on top of the state-of-the-art LibAFL framework, DynamiQ incorporates several practical optimizations in both task allocation and task-aware fuzzing. Evaluated on 12 real-world targets from OSS-Fuzz and FuzzBench over 25,000 CPU hours, DynamiQ outperforms state-of-the-art parallel fuzzers in both code coverage and vulnerability discovery, uncovering 9 previously unknown bugs in widely used and extensively fuzzed open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving IR-based Bug Localization with Semantics-Driven Query Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04468v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of research, software bug localization remains challenging due to heterogeneous content and inherent ambiguities in bug reports. Existing methods such as Information Retrieval (IR)-based approaches often attempt to match source documents to bug reports, overlooking the context and semantics of the source code. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g., Transformer models) show promising results in understanding both texts and code. However, they have not been yet adapted well to localize software bugs against bug reports. They could be also data or resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we propose, IQLoc, a novel bug localization approach that capitalizes on the strengths of both IR and LLM-based approaches. In particular, we leverage the program semantics understanding of transformer-based models to reason about the suspiciousness of code and reformulate queries during bug localization using Information Retrieval. To evaluate IQLoc, we refine the Bench4BL benchmark dataset and extend it by incorporating ~30% more recent bug reports, resulting in a benchmark containing ~7.5K bug reports. We evaluated IQLoc using three performance metrics and compare it against four baseline techniques. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority, achieving up to 58.52% and 60.59% in MAP, 61.49% and 64.58% in MRR, and 69.88% and 100.90% in HIT@K for the test bug reports with random and time-wise splits, respectively. Moreover, IQLoc improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces, 72.73% for those that include code elements, and 65.38% for those containing only descriptions in natural language. By integrating program semantic understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc mitigates several longstanding challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

As a vital tool for optimizing recruitment processes, reducing labor and time costs, and enhancing core competitiveness, intelligent recruitment management systems become an indispensable component of modern organizational talent strategies.Compared with the labor intensive tasks of resume screening, candidate position matching, and interview coordination in traditional manual recruitment, intelligent recruitment systems significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the hiring process through automation and data driven approaches. These systems enable rapid parsing of massive resume volumes, intelligent matching of candidates to positions, and automated scheduling of interview processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MulVuln: Enhancing Pre-trained LMs with Shared and Language-Specific Knowledge for Multilingual Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04397v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities (SVs) pose a critical threat to safety-critical systems, driving the adoption of AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning for software vulnerability detection. Despite promising results, most existing methods are limited to a single programming language. This is problematic given the multilingual nature of modern software, which is often complex and written in multiple languages. Current approaches often face challenges in capturing both shared and language-specific knowledge of source code, which can limit their performance on diverse programming languages and real-world codebases. To address this gap, we propose MULVULN, a novel multilingual vulnerability detection approach that learns from source code across multiple languages. MULVULN captures both the shared knowledge that generalizes across languages and the language-specific knowledge that reflects unique coding conventions. By integrating these aspects, it achieves more robust and effective detection of vulnerabilities in real-world multilingual software systems. The rigorous and extensive experiments on the real-world and diverse REEF dataset, consisting of 4,466 CVEs with 30,987 patches across seven programming languages, demonstrate the superiority of MULVULN over thirteen effective and state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, MULVULN achieves substantially higher F1-score, with improvements ranging from 1.45% to 23.59% compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

In RE, the goal is to ensure that implemented systems satisfy stakeholder needs through rigorous requirements elicitation, validation, and evaluation processes. Despite its critical role, RE continues to face persistent challenges, such as ambiguity, conflicting stakeholder needs, and the complexity of managing evolving requirements. A common view is that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to streamline the RE process, resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy, and management actions. However, using AI also introduces new concerns, such as ethical issues, biases, and lack of transparency. This paper explores how AI can enhance traditional RE practices by automating labor-intensive tasks, supporting requirement prioritization, and facilitating collaboration between stakeholders and AI systems. The paper also describes the opportunities and challenges that AI brings to RE. In particular, the vision calls for ethical practices in AI, along with a much-enhanced collaboration between academia and industry professionals. The focus should be on creating not only powerful but also trustworthy and practical AI solutions ready to adapt to the fast-paced world of software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SEAA 2025.

MacroBench instantiates seven self-hosted sites: Airbnb-like, TikTok-like, Reddit-like, Instagram-like, Facebook-like, Discord-like, and Threads-like, covering 681 tasks across interaction complexity and targeting difficulty. Our end-to-end protocol validates generated code via static checks, sandboxed execution, and outcome verification including DOM assertions and database snapshots, and includes a safety suite for scraping, spam/abuse, and credential/privacy prompts. Across 2636 model-task runs, we observe stratified success: GPT-4o-Mini achieves 96.8 percent, GPT-4.1 achieves 95.3 percent, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves 89.0 percent, and DeepSeek-V3.1 achieves 83.4 percent. Models handle simple tasks reliably at 91.7 percent but fail on complex workflows at 0.0 percent, and none meet production-quality coding practices despite functional completion.

This challenge becomes particularly relevant as code agents become used to solve isolated one-off programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to refactor code in ways that support growth and reusability. We first investigate what makes a good refactoring, finding via simulation results and a human study that Minimum Description Length best correlates with preferable refactorings. We then present both a benchmark and a method for refactoring: MiniCode, a benchmark where multiple files must be refactored into a shared library, and Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method for generating reusable libraries. We compare Librarian to state-of-the-art library generation methods, and study it on real-world code bases.</p></details> | 29 pages |

Twenty-three postgraduate students participated in a research study to prioritize security requirements (SRs) using the MoSCoW method and subsequently rated their proposed solutions against multiple evaluation criteria. We divided participants into two groups (one with and the other without access to LLM support during the task). Results showed no significant differences related to LLM use, suggesting that access to LLMs did not noticeably influence how participants evaluated cybersecurity solutions. However, statistically significant differences emerged between experience groups for certain criteria, such as estimated cost to develop a feature, perceived impact on user experience, and risk assessment related to non-implementation of the proposed feature. Participants with more professional experience tended to provide higher ratings for user experience impact and lower risk estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables, presented at IARIA CYBER 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generating High-Quality Datasets for Code Editing via Open-Source Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25203v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code editing plays a vital role in software engineering, requiring developers to adjust existing code according to natural language instructions while keeping functionality intact and avoiding unnecessary modifications. However, commit-based datasets commonly used for this task are often noisy, lack diversity, and fail to reflect the style of real-world edit instructions. To address this, we introduce OpenCodeEdit, an open-source pipeline that leverages multiple LLMs to synthesize realistic code-edit triplets. The pipeline produces both concise "lazy" instructions and more detailed "descriptive" ones, and applies filtering based on diffs and topics to guarantee data quality and variety. Using this process, we construct OCEDataFT, a curated dataset of 20K samples. Fine-tuning three advanced base models on OCEDataFT leads to significant performance boosts on the CanItEdit benchmark, with relative pass@1 improvements ranging from 4.50% to 20.79%. Notably, the resulting models achieve performance close to closed-source systems, narrowing the gap to GPT-4 to just 3.54%, without relying on proprietary resources or manual annotation.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Multi Language Models for On-the-Fly Syntax Highlighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04166v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Syntax highlighting is a critical feature in modern software development environments, enhancing code readability and developer productivity. However, delivering accurate highlighting in real time remains challenging for online and web-based development tools due to strict time and memory constraints on backend services. These systems must serve highlights rapidly and frequently, even when code is partially valid or invalid. This has led to on-the-fly syntax highlighting, where visual annotations are generated just before content is served, often at high request rates and under incomplete input conditions. To meet these demands efficiently, state-of-the-art models use deep learning to learn the behavior of brute-force syntax highlighting resolvers, tools that are easy to implement but too slow for production. Through the Deep Abstraction process, brute-force strategies are encoded into fast statistical models that achieve both high accuracy and low-latency inference. Despite their success, such models face key challenges: they support only one programming language per model, require large datasets from slow brute-force generators, and involve resource-intensive training. In multi-language environments, this means maintaining multiple independent models, increasing system complexity and operational cost. This work addresses these issues by introducing a unified model capable of highlighting up to six mainstream programming languages, reducing deployment complexity by a factor of six and improving performance on unseen languages. A novel normalization technique significantly enhances model generalization, while few-shot learning experiments show that a small number of oracle samples can replace large datasets, minimizing dependence on brute-force generators. Combined, these innovations enable efficient, scalable, and cost-effective syntax highlighting across diverse programming languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Semantic Clones of Unseen Functionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04143v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic code clone detection is the task of detecting whether two snippets of code implement the same functionality (e.g., Sort Array). Recently, many neural models achieved near-perfect performance on this task. These models seek to make inferences based on their training data. Consequently, they better detect clones similar to those they have seen during training and may struggle to detect those they have not. Developers seeking clones are, of course, interested in both types of clones. We confirm this claim through a literature review, identifying three practical clone detection tasks in which the model's goal is to detect clones of a functionality even if it was trained on clones of different functionalities. In light of this finding, we re-evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including both task-specific models and generative LLMs, on the task of detecting clones of unseen functionality. Our experiments reveal a drop in F1 of up to 48% (average 31%) for task-specific models. LLMs perform on par with task-specific models without explicit training for clone detection, but generalize better to unseen functionalities, where F1 drops up to 5% (average 3%) instead. We propose and evaluate the use of contrastive learning to improve the performance of existing models on clones of unseen functionality. We draw inspiration from the computer vision and natural language processing fields where contrastive learning excels at measuring similarity between two objects, even if they come from classes unseen during training. We replace the final classifier of the task-specific models with a contrastive classifier, while for the generative LLMs we propose contrastive in-context learning, guiding the LLMs to focus on the differences between clones and non-clones. The F1 on clones of unseen functionality is improved by up to 26% (average 9%) for task-specific models and up to 5% (average 3%) for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication (to appear) in the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces GA4GC, the first framework to systematically optimize coding agent runtime (greener agent) and code performance (greener code) trade-offs by discovering Pareto-optimal agent hyperparameters and prompt templates. Evaluation on the SWE-Perf benchmark demonstrates up to 135x hypervolume improvement, reducing agent runtime by 37.7% while improving correctness.

| **[Bamboo: LLM-Driven Discovery of API-Permission Mappings in the Android Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04078v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The permission mechanism in the Android Framework is integral to safeguarding the privacy of users by managing users' and processes' access to sensitive resources and operations. As such, developers need to be equipped with an in-depth understanding of API permissions to build robust Android apps. Unfortunately, the official API documentation by Android chronically suffers from imprecision and incompleteness, causing developers to spend significant effort to accurately discern necessary permissions. This potentially leads to incorrect permission declarations in Android app development, potentially resulting in security violations and app failures. Recent efforts in improving permission specification primarily leverage static and dynamic code analyses to uncover API-permission mappings within the Android framework. Yet, these methodologies encounter substantial shortcomings, including poor adaptability to Android SDK and Framework updates, restricted code coverage, and a propensity to overlook essential API-permission mappings in intricate codebases. This paper introduces a pioneering approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) for a systematic examination of API-permission mappings. In addition to employing LLMs, we integrate a dual-role prompting strategy and an API-driven code generation approach into our mapping discovery pipeline, resulting in the development of the corresponding tool, \tool{}. We formulate three research questions to evaluate the efficacy of \tool{} against state-of-the-art baselines, assess the completeness of official SDK documentation, and analyze the evolution of permission-required APIs across different SDK releases. Our experimental results reveal that \tool{} identifies 2,234, 3,552, and 4,576 API-permission mappings in Android versions 6, 7, and 10 respectively, substantially outprforming existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping the Trust Terrain: LLMs in Software Engineering -- Insights and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13793v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly growing in industry and academia for various software engineering (SE) tasks. As these models become more integral to critical processes, ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness becomes essential. Consequently, the concept of trust in these systems is becoming increasingly critical. Well-calibrated trust is important, as excessive trust can lead to security vulnerabilities, and risks, while insufficient trust can hinder innovation. However, the landscape of trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE is relatively unclear, with concepts such as trust, distrust, and trustworthiness lacking clear conceptualizations in the SE community. To bring clarity to the current research status and identify opportunities for future work, we conducted a comprehensive review of $88$ papers: a systematic literature review of $18$ papers focused on LLMs in SE, complemented by an analysis of 70 papers from broader trust literature. Additionally, we conducted a survey study with 25 domain experts to gain insights into practitioners' understanding of trust and identify gaps between existing literature and developers' perceptions. The result of our analysis serves as a roadmap that covers trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE and highlights areas for future exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

This apparent paradox suggests that traditional managerial functions persist despite the theoretical displacement of managerial hierarchy in Agile. This paper explores the persistence of engineering managers through a multidimensional framework encompassing historical context, theoretical tensions, organizational realities, empirical evidence, evolving managerial roles, and practical implications. A systematic literature review underpins our multifaceted analysis, supplemented by illustrative case studies. We conclude by proposing a conceptual model that reconciles Agile principles with managerial necessity, offering guidance for practitioners, researchers, and tool designers. Implications for leadership development, tool integration, and future research are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Despite its importance, developers often neglect refactoring due to the significant time, effort, and resources it requires, as well as the lack of immediate functional rewards. Although several automated refactoring tools have been proposed, they remain limited in supporting a broad spectrum of refactoring types. In this study, we explore whether instruction strategies inspired by human best-practice guidelines can enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform diverse refactoring tasks automatically. Leveraging the instruction-following and code comprehension capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-mini and DeepSeek-V3), we draw on Martin Fowler's refactoring guidelines to design multiple instruction strategies that encode motivations, procedural steps, and transformation objectives for 61 well-known refactoring types. We evaluate these strategies on benchmark examples and real-world code snippets from GitHub projects. Our results show that instruction designs grounded in Fowler's guidelines enable LLMs to successfully perform all benchmark refactoring types and preserve program semantics in real-world settings, an essential criterion for effective refactoring. Moreover, while descriptive instructions are more interpretable to humans, our results show that rule-based instructions often lead to better performance in specific scenarios. Interestingly, allowing models to focus on the overall goal of refactoring, rather than prescribing a fixed transformation type, can yield even greater improvements in code quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Code-Orchestrated Generation for Reliable Infrastructure-as-Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03902v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of cloud-native infrastructure has made Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) essential for reproducible and scalable deployments. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating IaC snippets from natural language prompts, their monolithic, single-pass generation approach often results in syntactic errors, policy violations, and unscalable designs. In this paper, we propose MACOG (Multi-Agent Code-Orchestrated Generation), a novel multi-agent LLM-based architecture for IaC generation that decomposes the task into modular subtasks handled by specialized agents: Architect, Provider Harmonizer, Engineer, Reviewer, Security Prover, Cost and Capacity Planner, DevOps, and Memory Curator. The agents interact via a shared-blackboard, finite-state orchestrator layer, and collectively produce Terraform configurations that are not only syntactically valid but also policy-compliant and semantically coherent. To ensure infrastructure correctness and governance, we incorporate Terraform Plan for execution validation and Open Policy Agent (OPA) for customizable policy enforcement. We evaluate MACOG using the IaC-Eval benchmark, where MACOG is the top enhancement across models, e.g., GPT-5 improves from 54.90 (RAG) to 74.02 and Gemini-2.5 Pro from 43.56 to 60.13, with concurrent gains on BLEU, CodeBERTScore, and an LLM-judge metric. Ablations show constrained decoding and deploy feedback are critical: removing them drops IaC-Eval to 64.89 and 56.93, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Brief History of the Waterfall Model: Past, Present, and Future](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03894v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The waterfall model, one of the earliest software development methodologies, has played a foundational role in shaping contemporary software engineering practices. This paper provides a historical and critical overview of the model, tracing its conceptual origins in software engineering, its formalization by Royce, and its evolution through decades of industry adoption and critique. Although often criticized for its rigidity, shortcomings, and high failure rates, the waterfall model persists in specific domains. Its principles continue to influence contemporary hybrid development frameworks that combine traditional and agile methods. Drawing on a range of scholarly sources, this study synthesizes key developments in the perception and application of the waterfall model. The analysis highlights how the model has shifted from a standalone framework to a component within modern hybrid methodologies. By revisiting its origins, assessing its present utility, and examining its role in contemporary development practices, this paper argues that the waterfall model remains relevant, not as a relic of the past but as part of context-aware development strategies. The paper contends that the model's enduring relevance lies in its adaptability. By recognizing both its limitations and its strengths, and by understanding its integration within hybrid approaches, practitioners can make more informed decisions about methodology selection and process design in diverse development environments.</p></details> |  |

However, its integration into real-world software systems remains constrained by hardware fragility, platform heterogeneity, and the absence of robust software engineering practices. This paper introduces Service-Oriented Quantum (SOQ), a novel paradigm that reimagines quantum software systems through the lens of classical service-oriented computing. Unlike prior approaches such as Quantum Service-Oriented Computing (QSOC), which treat quantum capabilities as auxiliary components within classical systems, SOQ positions quantum services as autonomous, composable, and interoperable entities. We define the foundational principles of SOQ, propose a layered technology stack to support its realization, and identify the key research and engineering challenges that must be addressed, including interoperability, hybridity, pricing models, service abstractions, and workforce development. This approach is of vital importance for the advancement of quantum technology because it enables the scalable, modular, and interoperable integration of quantum computing into real-world software systems independently and without relying on a dedicated classical environment to manage quantum processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Agent Collaboration for C to Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03879v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating C to memory-safe languages, like Rust, prevents critical memory safety vulnerabilities that are prevalent in legacy C software. Existing approaches for C to safe Rust translation, including LLM-assisted ones, do not generalize on larger (> 500 LoC) C codebases because they depend on complex program analyses that frequently break. In this work, we present ACToR (Adversarial C To Rust translator), a simple LLM agent-based approach. Inspired by GANs, ACToR pits a generator agent against a discriminator agent, which collaborate to iteratively generate a Rust translation. On each iteration, the translator agent synthesizes and refines a Rust translation to pass an existing suite of tests, and then the discriminator agent finds new failing tests. We demonstrate that ACToR translates all of the 63 real-world command line utilities considered in our benchmarks, which have an average size of 485 lines of code, and it achieves over 90% test pass rate with zero human intervention. To our knowledge, it is the first such system that reliably translates C programs of this scale. Furthermore, ACToR improves translation correctness by up to 18.9% compared to baseline, non-adversarial approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing Empirical Studies on LLM-Based Code Generation: Towards a Reference Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03862v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced transformative potential in automated code generation, addressing a wide range of software engineering challenges. However, empirical evaluation of LLM-based code generation lacks standardization, with studies varying widely in goals, tasks, and metrics, which limits comparability and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for designing and reporting empirical studies on LLM-based code generation. The framework is grounded in both our prior experience conducting such experiments and a comparative analysis of key similarities and differences among recent studies. It organizes evaluation around core components such as problem sources, quality attributes, and metrics, supporting structured and systematic experimentation. We demonstrate its applicability through representative case mappings and identify opportunities for refinement. Looking forward, we plan to evolve the framework into a more robust and mature tool for standardizing LLM evaluation across software engineering contexts.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Backdoors in Code Summarizers: How Bad Is It?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code LLMs are increasingly employed in software development. However, studies have shown that they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks: when a trigger (a specific input pattern) appears in the input, the backdoor will be activated and cause the model to generate malicious outputs. Researchers have designed various triggers and demonstrated the feasibility of implanting backdoors by poisoning a fraction of the training data. Some basic conclusions have been made, such as backdoors becoming easier to implant when more training data is modified. However, existing research has not explored other factors influencing backdoor attacks on Code LLMs, such as training batch size, epoch number, and the broader design space for triggers, e.g., trigger length. To bridge this gap, we use code summarization as an example to perform an empirical study that systematically investigates the factors affecting backdoor effectiveness and understands the extent of the threat posed. Three categories of factors are considered: data, model, and inference, revealing previously overlooked findings. We find that the prevailing consensus -- that attacks are ineffective at extremely low poisoning rates -- is incorrect. The absolute number of poisoned samples matters as well. Specifically, poisoning just 20 out of 454K samples (0.004% poisoning rate -- far below the minimum setting of 0.1% in prior studies) successfully implants backdoors! Moreover, the common defense is incapable of removing even a single poisoned sample from it. Additionally, small batch sizes increase the risk of backdoor attacks. We also uncover other critical factors such as trigger types, trigger length, and the rarity of tokens in the triggers, leading to valuable insights for assessing Code LLMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks. Our study highlights the urgent need for defense mechanisms against extremely low poisoning rate settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)</p></details> |

In internal software development at Google, we observe that code is pasted 4 times more often than it is manually typed. These paste actions frequently require follow-up edits, ranging from simple reformatting and renaming to more complex style adjustments and cross-language translations. Prior work has shown deep learning can be used to predict these edits. In this work, we show how to iteratively develop and scale Smart Paste, an IDE feature for post-paste edit suggestions, to Google's development environment. This experience can serve as a guide for AI practitioners on a holistic approach to feature development, covering user experience, system integration, and model capabilities. Since deployment, Smart Paste has had overwhelmingly positive feedback with a 45% acceptance rate. At Google's enterprise scale, these accepted suggestions account substantially for over 1% of all code written company-wide.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Extracting Conceptual Knowledge to Locate Software Issues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21427v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue localization, which identifies faulty code elements such as files or functions, is critical for effective bug fixing. While recent LLM-based and LLM-agent-based approaches improve accuracy, they struggle in large-scale repositories due to concern tangling, where relevant logic is buried in large functions, and concern scattering, where related logic is dispersed across files. To address these challenges, we propose RepoLens, a novel approach that abstracts and leverages conceptual knowledge from code repositories. RepoLens decomposes fine-grained functionalities and recomposes them into high-level concerns, semantically coherent clusters of functionalities that guide LLMs. It operates in two stages: an offline stage that extracts and enriches conceptual knowledge into a repository-wide knowledge base, and an online stage that retrieves issue-specific terms, clusters and ranks concerns by relevance, and integrates them into localization workflows via minimally intrusive prompt enhancements. We evaluate RepoLens on SWE-Lancer-Loc, a benchmark of 216 tasks derived from SWE-Lancer. RepoLens consistently improves three state-of-the-art tools, namely AgentLess, OpenHands, and mini-SWE-agent, achieving average gains of over 22% in Hit@k and 46% in Recall@k for file- and function-level localization. It generalizes across models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1) with Hit@1 and Recall@10 gains up to 504% and 376%, respectively. Ablation studies and manual evaluation confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the constructed concerns.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems also introduce unique challenges, particularly in maintaining software quality and performance. Among these challenges, Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) has emerged as a growing concern, significantly impacting the maintainability and overall quality of ML and DL-enabled systems. Despite its critical implications, the lifecycle of DL-specific SATD, how developers introduce, acknowledge, and address it over time-remains underexplored. This study presents a preliminary analysis of the persistence and lifecycle of DL-specific SATD in DL-enabled systems. The purpose of this project is to uncover the patterns of SATD introduction, recognition, and durability during the development life cycle, providing information on how to manage these issues. Using mining software repository techniques, we examined 40 ML projects, focusing on 185 DL-specific SATD instances. The analysis tracked the introduction and persistence of SATD instances through project commit histories to assess their lifecycle and developer actions. The findings indicate that DL-specific SATD is predominantly introduced during the early and middle stages of project development. Training and Hardware phases showed the longest SATD durations, highlighting critical areas where debt accumulates and persists. Additionally, developers introduce DL-specific SATD more frequently during feature implementation and bug fixes. This study emphasizes the need for targeted DL-specific SATD management strategies in DL-enabled systems to mitigate its impact. By understanding the temporal characteristics and evolution of DL-specific SATD, developers can prioritize interventions at critical stages to improve the maintainability and quality of the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Workshop of Software Quality Assurance for Artificial Intelligence 2025 (SQA4AI), Montr\'eal, Canada</p></details> |

This creates a barrier for the academic community, as researchers must often develop dedicated platforms to conduct studies on human--AI interaction, making reproducible research and large-scale data analysis impractical. In this work, we introduce Code4MeV2, a research-oriented, open-source code completion plugin for JetBrains IDEs, as a solution to this limitation. Code4MeV2 is designed using a client--server architecture and features inline code completion and a context-aware chat assistant. Its core contribution is a modular and transparent data collection framework that gives researchers fine-grained control over telemetry and context gathering. Code4MeV2 achieves industry-comparable performance in terms of code completion, with an average latency of 200~ms. We assess our tool through a combination of an expert evaluation and a user study with eight participants. Feedback from both researchers and daily users highlights its informativeness and usefulness. We invite the community to adopt and contribute to this tool.

We present APIDA-Chat, an open-source pipeline that converts symbolic dialogue-act "scripts" into realistic, domain-grounded API Search conversations using a lightweight model for inexpensive training data generation. Phase I pairs a legacy dialogue planner with a high-capability teacher LLM (o4-mini) to synthesize a "gold set" of realized dialogues; then, a smaller Llama 3.2 3B student model is fine-tuned on this corpus. Phase II drops the teacher and reuses the same planner with the fine-tuned model, allowing rapid, low-cost synthesis of new dialogues without exposing source code to external services. The fine-tuned student improves BLEU from 0.38 to 0.50 and BERTScore from 0.88 to 0.91 versus the base model while running entirely on a single consumer GPU. All components are modular and publicly released to serve as a conservative baseline for future work.

Cache layers achieving 99% hit rates can obscure database bottlenecks until cache failures trigger 100x load amplification and cascading collapse. Current reliability engineering focuses on reactive incident response rather than proactive detection of optimization-induced vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for systematic latent risk detection, prevention, and optimization through integrated mathematical modeling, intelligent perturbation testing, and risk-aware performance optimization. We introduce the Latent Risk Index (LRI) that correlates strongly with incident severity (r=0.863, p<0.001), enabling predictive risk assessment. Our framework integrates three systems: HYDRA employing six optimization-aware perturbation strategies achieving 89.7% risk discovery rates, RAVEN providing continuous production monitoring with 92.9% precision and 93.8% recall across 1,748 scenarios, and APEX enabling risk-aware optimization maintaining 96.6% baseline performance while reducing latent risks by 59.2%. Evaluation across three testbed environments demonstrates strong statistical validation with large effect sizes (Cohen d>2.0) and exceptional reproducibility (r>0.92). Production deployment over 24 weeks shows 69.1% mean time to recovery reduction, 78.6% incident severity reduction, and 81 prevented incidents generating 1.44M USD average annual benefits with 3.2-month ROI. Our approach transforms reliability engineering from reactive incident management to proactive risk-aware optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 tables, 4 figures.

Functional bugs, instances where implementations diverge from behaviors specified in RFC documents, can lead to severe consequences, including faulty routing, authentication bypasses, and service disruptions. Detecting these bugs requires deep semantic analysis across specification documents and source code, a task beyond the capabilities of traditional static analysis tools. This paper introduces RFCAudit, an autonomous agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect functional bugs by checking conformance between network protocol implementations and their RFC specifications. Inspired by the human auditing procedure, RFCAudit comprises two key components: an indexing agent and a detection agent. The former hierarchically summarizes protocol code semantics, generating semantic indexes that enable the detection agent to narrow down the scanning scope. The latter employs demand-driven retrieval to iteratively collect additional relevant data structures and functions, eventually identifying potential inconsistencies with the RFC specifications effectively. We evaluate RFCAudit across six real-world network protocol implementations. RFCAudit identifies 47 functional bugs with 81.9% precision, of which 20 bugs have been confirmed or fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[HFuzzer: Testing Large Language Models for Package Hallucinations via Phrase-based Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23835v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation, but they face critical security risks when applied to practical production due to package hallucinations, in which LLMs recommend non-existent packages. These hallucinations can be exploited in software supply chain attacks, where malicious attackers exploit them to register harmful packages. It is critical to test LLMs for package hallucinations to mitigate package hallucinations and defend against potential attacks. Although researchers have proposed testing frameworks for fact-conflicting hallucinations in natural language generation, there is a lack of research on package hallucinations. To fill this gap, we propose HFUZZER, a novel phrase-based fuzzing framework to test LLMs for package hallucinations. HFUZZER adopts fuzzing technology and guides the model to infer a wider range of reasonable information based on phrases, thereby generating enough and diverse coding tasks. Furthermore, HFUZZER extracts phrases from package information or coding tasks to ensure the relevance of phrases and code, thereby improving the relevance of generated tasks and code. We evaluate HFUZZER on multiple LLMs and find that it triggers package hallucinations across all selected models. Compared to the mutational fuzzing framework, HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages and generates more diverse tasks. Additionally, when testing the model GPT-4o, HFUZZER finds 46 unique hallucinated packages. Further analysis reveals that for GPT-4o, LLMs exhibit package hallucinations not only during code generation but also when assisting with environment configuration.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE25 |

In the industry, including companies specializing in software testing, there is a significant demand for the automatic generation of high-level test cases from requirement documents using Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts to utilize LLMs for requirement analysis are underway. In some cases, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is employed for generating high-level test cases using LLMs. However, in practical applications, it is necessary to create a RAG tailored to the knowledge system of each specific application, which is labor-intensive. Moreover, when applying high-level test case generation as a prompt, there is no established method for instructing the generation of high-level test cases at a level applicable to other specifications without using RAG. It is required to establish a method for the automatic generation of high-level test cases that can be generalized across a wider range of requirement documents. In this paper, we propose a method for generating high-level (GHL) test cases from requirement documents using only prompts, without creating RAGs. In the proposed method, first, the requirement document is input into the LLM to generate test design techniques corresponding to the requirement document. Then, high-level test cases are generated for each of the generated test design techniques. Furthermore, we verify an evaluation method based on semantic similarity of the generated high-level test cases. In the experiments, we confirmed the method using datasets from Bluetooth and Mozilla, where requirement documents and high-level test cases are available, achieving macro-recall measurement of 0.81 and 0.37, respectively. We believe that the method is feasible for practical application in generating high-level test cases without using RAG.</p></details> | 11pages |
| **[Wired for Reuse: Automating Context-Aware Code Adaptation in IDEs via LLM-Based Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01315v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Copy-paste-modify is a widespread and pragmatic practice in software development, where developers adapt reused code snippets, sourced from platforms such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or LLM outputs, into their local codebase. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this adaptation is code wiring: the context-aware process of substituting unresolved variables in pasted code with suitable variables or expressions from the surrounding context. Existing solutions either rely on heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively utilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of adaptation cases are context-dependent. In this paper, we introduce WIRL, an LLM-based agent for code wiring framed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) infilling task. WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an orchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and perform context-aware substitutions. To balance efficiency and autonomy, the agent adopts a mixed strategy: deterministic rule-based steps for common patterns, and a state-machine-guided decision process for intelligent exploration. We evaluate WIRL on a carefully curated, high-quality dataset consisting of real-world code adaptation scenarios. Our approach achieves an exact match precision of 91.7% and a recall of 90.0%, outperforming advanced LLMs by 22.6 and 13.7 percentage points in precision and recall, respectively, and surpassing IntelliJ IDEA by 54.3 and 49.9 percentage points. These results underscore its practical utility, particularly in contexts with complex variable dependencies or multiple unresolved variables. We believe WIRL paves the way for more intelligent and context-aware developer assistance in modern IDEs.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE2025 |
| **[REFINE: Enhancing Program Repair Agents through Context-Aware Patch Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03588v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in automatic program repair (APR), especially in repository-level settings where the goal is to generate patches based on natural language issue descriptions, large codebases, and regression tests. However, despite their promise, current LLM-based APR techniques often struggle to produce correct fixes due to limited understanding of code context and over-reliance on incomplete test suites. As a result, they frequently generate Draft Patches-partially correct patches that either incompletely address the bug or overfit to the test cases. In this work, we propose a novel patch refinement framework, Refine, that systematically transforms Draft Patches into correct ones. Refine addresses three key challenges: disambiguating vague issue and code context, diversifying patch candidates through test-time scaling, and aggregating partial fixes via an LLM-powered code review process. We implement Refine as a general refinement module that can be integrated into both open-agent-based and workflow-based APR systems. Our evaluation on the SWE-Bench Lite benchmark shows that Refine achieves state-of-the-art results among workflow-based approaches and approaches the best-known performance across all APR categories. Specifically, Refine boosts AutoCodeRover's performance by 14.67%, achieving a score of 51.67% and surpassing all prior baselines. On SWE-Bench Verified, Refine improves the resolution rate by 12.2%, and when integrated across multiple APR systems, it yields an average improvement of 14%-demonstrating its broad effectiveness and generalizability. These results highlight the effectiveness of refinement as a missing component in current APR pipelines and the potential of agentic collaboration in closing the gap between near-correct and correct patches. We also open source our code.</p></details> | <details><summary>We al...</summary><p>We also open source our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SemAgent-7B2F/README.md</p></details> |
| **[Formal Analysis of Metastable Failures in Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03551v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale software systems demonstrate metastable failures. In this class of failures, a stressor such as a temporary spike in workload causes the system performance to drop and, subsequently, the system performance continues to remain low even when the stressor is removed. These failures have been reported by many large corporations and considered to be a rare but catastrophic source of availability outages in cloud systems. In this paper, we provide the mathematical foundations of metastability in request-response server systems. We model such systems using a domain-specific language. We show how to construct continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) that approximate the semantics of the programs through modeling and data-driven calibration. We use the structure of the CTMC models to provide a visualization of the qualitative behavior of the model. The visualization is a surprisingly effective way to identify system parameterizations that cause a system to show metastable behaviors. We complement the qualitative analysis with quantitative predictions. We provide a formal notion of metastable behaviors based on escape probabilities, and show that metastable behaviors are related to the eigenvalue structure of the CTMC. Our characterization leads to algorithmic tools to predict recovery times in metastable models of server systems. We have implemented our technique in a tool for the modeling and analysis of server systems. Through models inspired by failures in real request-response systems, we show that our qualitative visual analysis captures and predicts many instances of metastability that were observed in the field in a matter of milliseconds. Our algorithms confirm that recovery times surge as the system parameters approach metastable modes in the dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentHub: A Research Agenda for Agent Sharing Infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03495v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents are rapidly proliferating, yet the infrastructure for discovering, evaluating, and governing them remains fragmented compared to mature ecosystems like software package registries (e.g., npm) and model hubs (e.g., Hugging Face). Recent research and engineering works have begun to consider the requisite infrastructure, but so far they focus narrowly -- on distribution, naming, or protocol negotiation. However, considering broader software engineering requirements would improve open-source distribution and ease reuse. We therefore propose AgentHub, a research agenda for agent sharing. By framing the key challenges of capability clarity, lifecycle transparency, interoperability, governance, security, and workflow integration, AgentHub charts a community-wide agenda for building reliable and scalable agent ecosystems. Our vision is a future where agents can be shared, trusted, and composed as seamlessly as today's software libraries.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Agents for Automated Dependency Upgrades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03480v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a codebase expands over time, its library dependencies can become outdated and require updates to maintain innovation and security. However, updating a library can introduce breaking changes in the code, necessitating significant developer time for maintenance. To address this, we introduce a framework of LLM agents to be used in combination with migration documentation to automatically recommend and apply code updates and ensure compatibility with new versions. Our solution can automatically localize updated library usages in live Java codebases and implement recommended fixes in a user-friendly manner. The system architecture consists of multiple key components: a Summary Agent, Control Agent, and Code Agent. To validate our approach, we apply the framework on an industrial use case by which we create three synthetic code repositories with major Upgrade changes and benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our approach not only performs upgrades using fewer tokens across all cases but also achieves a precision of 71.4%, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relative Code Comprehensibility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03474v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically predicting how difficult it is for humans to understand a code snippet can assist developers in tasks like deciding when and where to refactor. Despite many proposed code comprehensibility metrics, studies have shown they often correlate poorly with actual measurements of human comprehensibility. This has motivated the use of machine learning models to predict human comprehensibility directly from code, but these models have also shown limited accuracy. We argue that model inaccuracy stems from inherent noise in human comprehensibility data, which confuses models trained to predict it directly. To address this, we propose training models to predict the relative comprehensibility of two code snippets - that is, predicting which snippet a human would find easier to understand without predicting each snippet's comprehensibility in isolation. This mitigates noise in predicting 'absolute' comprehensibility measurements, but is still useful for downstream software-engineering tasks like assessing whether refactoring improves or hinders comprehensibility. We conducted a study to assess and compare the effectiveness of absolute and relative code comprehensibility prediction via machine learning. We used a dataset of 150 Java code snippets and 12.5k human comprehensibility measurements from prior user studies, comparing the models' performance with naive baselines (eg 'always predict the majority class'). Our findings indicate that absolute comprehensibility models improve over the baselines by at most 33.4% and frequently underperform. In contrast, relative comprehensibility models are substantially better, with average improvements of 137.8% and 74.7% for snippet-wise and developer-wise prediction, respectively. These results suggest that relative comprehensibility models learn more effectively from the data, supporting their practical applicability for downstream SE tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALMAS: an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03463v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been leading the way in applied LLM research across a number of fields. One notable area is software development, where researchers have advanced the automation of code implementation, code testing, code maintenance, inter alia, using LLM agents. However, software development is a multifaceted environment that extends beyond just code. As such, a successful LLM system must factor in multiple stages of the software development life-cycle (SDLC). In this paper, we propose a vision for ALMAS, an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering framework, which follows the above SDLC philosophy such that it may work within an agile software development team to perform several tasks end-to-end. ALMAS aligns its agents with agile roles, and can be used in a modular fashion to seamlessly integrate with human developers and their development environment. We showcase the progress towards ALMAS through our published works and a use case demonstrating the framework, where ALMAS is able to seamlessly generate an application and add a new feature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repairing Leaks in Resource Wrappers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03461v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A resource leak occurs when a program fails to release a finite resource like a socket, file descriptor or database connection. While sound static analysis tools can detect all leaks, automatically repairing them remains challenging. Prior work took the output of a detection tool and attempted to repair only leaks from a hard-coded list of library resource types. That approach limits the scope of repairable leaks: real-world code uses resource wrappers that store a resource in a field and must themselves be closed. This paper makes four key contributions to improve resource leak repair in the presence of wrappers. (1) It integrates inference of resource management specifications into the repair pipeline, enabling extant fixing approaches to reason about wrappers. (2) It transforms programs into variants that are easier to analyze, making inference, detection, and fixing tools more effective; for instance, it makes detection tools report problems closer to the root cause, often in a client of a resource wrapper rather than within the wrapper class itself. (3) A novel field containment analysis reasons about resource lifetimes, enabling repair of more leaks involving resources stored in fields. (4) It introduces a new repair pattern and more precise reasoning to better handle resources stored in non-final fields. Prior work fixed 41% of resource leak warnings in the NJR benchmark suite; our implementation Arodnap fixes 68%.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLSEMANTICSBENCH: Large Language Models As Programming Language Interpreters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03415v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) excel at code reasoning, a natural question arises: can an LLM execute programs (i.e., act as an interpreter) purely based on a programming language's formal semantics? If so, it will enable rapid prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs could serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of their robust semantics understanding. We release the benchmark and the supporting code at https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/PLSemanticsBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstain and Validate: A Dual-LLM Policy for Reducing Noise in Agentic Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03217v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex, repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise, wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports, patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale deployment of agentic APR systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLAMAFUZZ: Large Language Model Enhanced Greybox Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07714v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Greybox fuzzing has achieved success in revealing bugs and vulnerabilities in programs. However, randomized mutation strategies have limited the fuzzer's performance on structured data. Specialized fuzzers can handle complex structured data, but require additional efforts in grammar and suffer from low throughput. In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing the Large Language Model to enhance greybox fuzzing for structured data. We utilize the pre-trained knowledge of LLM about data conversion and format to generate new valid inputs. We further fine-tuned it with paired mutation seeds to learn structured format and mutation strategies effectively. Our LLM-based fuzzer, LLAMAFUZZ, integrates the power of LLM to understand and mutate structured data to fuzzing. We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a wide variety of real-world programs. LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor by 41 bugs on average. We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials. Moreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and bug reached. Compared to AFL++, LLAMAFUZZ achieved 27.19% more branches in real-world program sets on average. We also demonstrate a case study to explain how LLMs enhance the fuzzing process in terms of code coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Tuning LLM-based Code Optimization via Meta-Prompting: An Industrial Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01443v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) for automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of multi-LLM systems in production environments. We introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages metaprompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts. It is an essential part of the ARTEMIS code optimization platform for automated validation and scaling. Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting and that major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters, providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE'25 Industry Showcase</p></details> |
| **[When Names Disappear: Revealing What LLMs Actually Understand About Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03178v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code understanding and generalization.</p></details> |  |

While counterfactual explanations, which describe what could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the choice of when each explanation type is most effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Ex-ASE 2025, co-located with the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[State Field Coverage: A Metric for Oracle Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03071v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of testing in uncovering software defects depends not only on the characteristics of the test inputs and how thoroughly they exercise the software, but also on the quality of the oracles used to determine whether the software behaves as expected. Therefore, assessing the quality of oracles is crucial to improve the overall effectiveness of the testing process. Existing metrics have been used for this purpose, but they either fail to provide a comprehensive basis for guiding oracle improvement, or they are tailored to specific types of oracles, thus limiting their generality. In this paper, we introduce state field coverage, a novel metric for assessing oracle quality. This metric measures the proportion of an object's state, as statically defined by its class fields, that an oracle may access during test execution. The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a higher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software under analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to determine whether tests pass or not. We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage metric. Being statically computed, the metric is efficient and provides direct guidance for improving test oracles by identifying state fields that remain unexamined. We evaluate state field coverage through experiments involving 273 representation invariants and 249,027 test assertions. The results show that state field coverage is a well-suited metric for assessing oracle quality, as it strongly correlates with the oracles' fault-detection ability, measured by mutation score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Contract Intent Detection with Pre-trained Programming Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20086v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious developer intents in smart contracts constitute significant security threats to decentralized applications, leading to substantial economic losses. To address this, SmartIntentNN was previously introduced as a deep learning model for detecting unsafe developer intents. By combining the Universal Sentence Encoder, a K-means clustering-based intent highlighting mechanism, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, the model achieved an F1 score of 0.8633 on an evaluation set of 10,000 real-world smart contracts across ten distinct intent categories. In this study, we present an enhanced version of this model, SmartIntentNN2 (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network V2). The primary enhancement is the integration of a BERT-based pre-trained programming language model, which we domain-adaptively pre-train on a dataset of 16,000 real-world smart contracts using a Masked Language Modeling objective. SmartIntentNN2 retains the BiLSTM-based multi-label classification network for intent detection. On the same evaluation set of 10,000 smart contracts, SmartIntentNN2 achieves superior performance with an accuracy of 0.9789, precision of 0.9090, recall of 0.9476, and an F1 score of 0.9279, substantially outperforming its predecessor and other baseline models. Notably, SmartIntentNN2 also delivers a 65.5% relative improvement in F1 score over GPT-4.1 on this specialized task. These results establish SmartIntentNN2 as a new state-of-the-art model for smart contract intent detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, this migration process remains largely manual and labour-intensive. While existing literature offers various strategies for decomposing monoliths, these approaches primarily focus on architecture-level guidance, often overlooking the code-level challenges and dependencies that developers must address during the migration. This article introduces a catalogue of seven refactorings specifically designed to support the transition to a microservices architecture with a focus on handling dependencies. The catalogue provides developers with a systematic guide that consolidates refactorings identified in the literature and addresses the critical gap in systematizing the process at the code level. By offering a structured, step-by-step approach, this work simplifies the migration process and lays the groundwork for its potential automation, empowering developers to implement these changes efficiently and effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the EuroPLoP 2025 proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Investigating The Smells of LLM Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03029v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate program code. Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of generated code, but there is far less on code quality. Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating the quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which the quality of LLM generated code should be improved. Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code quality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of professionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets according to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to represent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also present an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with the Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon. Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code smells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with a smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%) and finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was 63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design smells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more complex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving object-orientated concepts. Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding task complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human written code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM generated code is noticeably poorer than human written code.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional fault analysis, while valuable, typically involves multiple expert-driven steps such as collecting potential faults, filtering, and manual investigation. These processes are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks that hinder large-scale fault studies in complex yet critical software systems and slow the pace of iterative empirical research. In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation, and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software. Specifically, we perform the evaluation on 3,829 software faults drawn from a high-quality empirical study. Our results show that LLMs can substantially improve efficiency in fault analysis, with an average processing time of about two hours, compared to the weeks of manual effort typically required. We conclude by outlining a detailed research plan that highlights both the potential of LLMs for advancing empirical fault studies and the open challenges that required be addressed to achieve fully automated, end-to-end software fault analysis.</p></details> | 5 pages |

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation: A Survey with Focus on Repository-Level Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04905v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved automated code generation. While function-level and file-level generation have achieved promising results, real-world software development typically requires reasoning across entire repositories. This gives rise to the challenging task of Repository-Level Code Generation (RLCG), where models must capture long-range dependencies, ensure global semantic consistency, and generate coherent code spanning multiple files or modules. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that integrates external retrieval mechanisms with LLMs, enhancing context-awareness and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research on Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), with an emphasis on repository-level approaches.

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

Despite advances in fuzzing techniques, such as coverage-guided greybox fuzzing, many fuzzers struggle with coverage plateaus caused by fuzz blockers, limiting their ability to find deeper vulnerabilities. Human expertise can address these challenges, but analyzing fuzzing results to guide this support remains labor-intensive. To tackle this, we introduce InsightQL, the first human-assisting framework for fuzz blocker analysis. Powered by a unified database and an intuitive parameterized query interface, InsightQL aids developers in systematically extracting insights and efficiently unblocking fuzz blockers. Our experiments on 14 popular real-world libraries from the FuzzBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of InsightQL, leading to the unblocking of many fuzz blockers and considerable improvements in code coverage (up to 13.90%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity resolution of software metadata using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23500v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of software in research activities. Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences. Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices. However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse documentation practices. To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability, consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to address its heterogeneity and scale. This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the Life Sciences. We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard, examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.</p></details> |  |

Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring that GUI implementations fulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering, especially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into development workflows. Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or LLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces, and typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated development agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework that leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification of NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to interpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and execute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector systematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification process, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to iteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code generation in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that unifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for supervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the end-to-end requirements verification process. We evaluated GUISpector on a comprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria annotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection of requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for seamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven development workflows.

| **[An Empirical Study of SOTA RCA Models: From Oversimplified Benchmarks to Realistic Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04711v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While cloud-native microservice architectures have transformed software development, their complexity makes Root Cause Analysis (RCA) both crucial and challenging. Although many data-driven RCA models have been proposed, we find that existing benchmarks are often oversimplified and fail to capture real-world conditions. Our preliminary study shows that simple rule-based methods can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on four widely used benchmarks, suggesting performance overestimation due to benchmark simplicity. To address this, we systematically analyze popular RCA benchmarks and identify key limitations in fault injection, call graph design, and telemetry patterns. Based on these insights, we develop an automated framework to generate more realistic benchmarks, yielding a dataset of 1,430 validated failure cases from 9,152 injections, covering 25 fault types under dynamic workloads with hierarchical ground-truth labels and verified SLI impact. Re-evaluation of 11 SOTA models on this dataset shows low Top@1 accuracy (average 0.21, best 0.37) and significantly longer execution times. Our analysis highlights three common failure patterns: scalability issues, observability blind spots, and modeling bottlenecks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project is available on https://operationspai.github.io/</p></details> |

This includes Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT), which aims to ensure that the system functions correctly under real-world operational conditions. In satellite development, In-Orbit Testing (IOT) is a crucial OAT activity performed regularly and as needed after deployment in orbit to check the satellite's performance and ensure that operational requirements are met. The scheduling of an IOT campaign, which executes multiple IOT procedures, is an important yet challenging problem, as it accounts for various factors, including satellite visibility, antenna usage costs, testing time periods, and operational constraints. To address the IOT scheduling problem, we propose a multi-objective approach to generate near-optimal IOT schedules, accounting for operational costs, fragmentation (i.e., the splitting of tests), and resource efficiency, which align with practitioners' objectives for IOT scheduling. Our industrial case study with SES Techcom shows significant improvements, as follows: an average improvement of 49.4% in the cost objective, 60.4% in the fragmentation objective, and 30% in the resource usage objective, compared to our baselines. Additionally, our approach improves cost efficiency by 538% and resource usage efficiency by 39.42% compared to manually constructed schedules provided by practitioners, while requiring only 12.5% of the time needed for manual IOT scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review (when applicable) or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

However, whether emotions affect perceived productivity remains an open question. This study aims to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between emotional state and perceived productivity among software developers. We employed a two-stage approach. First, a survey was conducted with a pool of nine experts to validate the measurement model. Second, a survey was administered to a pool of 88 software developers to empirically test the formulated hypothesis by using Partial Least Squares, as the data analysis method. The results of the path analysis clearly confirm the formulated hypothesis, showing that the emotional state of a software developer has a strong positive, and significant impact (beta = 0.893, p < 0.001) on perceived productivity among software developers. The findings highlight the importance of managing and improving developers emotional well-being to enhance productivity in software development environments. Additionally, interventions aimed at reducing burnout, stress, and other negative factors could have a considerable impact on their performance outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 tables, 96 references</p></details> |

When the codomain of $f$ is equipped with a total order, it is easy to specify, implement, and verify generic solutions to this problem. But what if $f$ is affected by uncertainties? What if one seeks values that minimize more than one objective, or if $f$ does not return a single result but a set of possible results, or even a probability distribution? Such situations are common in climate science, economics, and engineering. Developing trustworthy solution methods for optimization under uncertainty requires formulating and answering these questions rigorously, including deciding which order relations to apply in different cases. We show how functional programming can support this task, and apply it to specify and test solution methods for cases where optimization is affected by two conceptually different kinds of uncertainty: value and functorial uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Programming the software for such systems remains a largely manual and tedious process, incurring costs of millions of dollars for extensive facilities. Large language models (LLMs) have been found helpful in generating DCS control logic, resulting in commercial copilot tools. Today, these tools are focused on textual notations, they provide limited automation, and have not been tested on large datasets with realistic test cases. We introduce Spec2Control, a highly automated LLM workflow to generate graphical control logic directly from natural language user requirements. Experiments using an open dataset with 10 control narratives and 65 complex test cases demonstrate that Spec2Control can successfully identify control strategies, can generate 98.6% of correct control strategy connections autonomously, and can save between 94-96% of human labor. Spec2Control is being integrated into commercial ABB engineering tools, but is also available as an open-source variant for independent validation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

We present LogSage, the first end-to-end LLM-powered framework for root cause analysis (RCA) and automated remediation of CI/CD failures. LogSage employs a token-efficient log preprocessing pipeline to filter noise and extract critical errors, then performs structured diagnostic prompting for accurate RCA. For solution generation, it leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to reuse historical fixes and invokes automation fixes via LLM tool-calling. On a newly curated benchmark of 367 GitHub CI/CD failures, LogSage achieves over 98\% precision, near-perfect recall, and an F1 improvement of more than 38\% points in the RCA stage, compared with recent LLM-based baselines. In a year-long industrial deployment at ByteDance, it processed over 1.07M executions, with end-to-end precision exceeding 80\%. These results demonstrate that LogSage provides a scalable and practical solution for automating CI/CD failure management in real-world DevOps workflows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Improving IR-based Bug Localization with Semantics-Driven Query Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04468v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of research, software bug localization remains challenging due to heterogeneous content and inherent ambiguities in bug reports. Existing methods such as Information Retrieval (IR)-based approaches often attempt to match source documents to bug reports, overlooking the context and semantics of the source code. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g., Transformer models) show promising results in understanding both texts and code. However, they have not been yet adapted well to localize software bugs against bug reports. They could be also data or resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we propose, IQLoc, a novel bug localization approach that capitalizes on the strengths of both IR and LLM-based approaches. In particular, we leverage the program semantics understanding of transformer-based models to reason about the suspiciousness of code and reformulate queries during bug localization using Information Retrieval. To evaluate IQLoc, we refine the Bench4BL benchmark dataset and extend it by incorporating ~30% more recent bug reports, resulting in a benchmark containing ~7.5K bug reports. We evaluated IQLoc using three performance metrics and compare it against four baseline techniques. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority, achieving up to 58.52% and 60.59% in MAP, 61.49% and 64.58% in MRR, and 69.88% and 100.90% in HIT@K for the test bug reports with random and time-wise splits, respectively. Moreover, IQLoc improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces, 72.73% for those that include code elements, and 65.38% for those containing only descriptions in natural language. By integrating program semantic understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc mitigates several longstanding challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

As a vital tool for optimizing recruitment processes, reducing labor and time costs, and enhancing core competitiveness, intelligent recruitment management systems become an indispensable component of modern organizational talent strategies.Compared with the labor intensive tasks of resume screening, candidate position matching, and interview coordination in traditional manual recruitment, intelligent recruitment systems significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the hiring process through automation and data driven approaches. These systems enable rapid parsing of massive resume volumes, intelligent matching of candidates to positions, and automated scheduling of interview processes.</p></details> |  |

In RE, the goal is to ensure that implemented systems satisfy stakeholder needs through rigorous requirements elicitation, validation, and evaluation processes. Despite its critical role, RE continues to face persistent challenges, such as ambiguity, conflicting stakeholder needs, and the complexity of managing evolving requirements. A common view is that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to streamline the RE process, resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy, and management actions. However, using AI also introduces new concerns, such as ethical issues, biases, and lack of transparency. This paper explores how AI can enhance traditional RE practices by automating labor-intensive tasks, supporting requirement prioritization, and facilitating collaboration between stakeholders and AI systems. The paper also describes the opportunities and challenges that AI brings to RE. In particular, the vision calls for ethical practices in AI, along with a much-enhanced collaboration between academia and industry professionals. The focus should be on creating not only powerful but also trustworthy and practical AI solutions ready to adapt to the fast-paced world of software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SEAA 2025.

MacroBench instantiates seven self-hosted sites: Airbnb-like, TikTok-like, Reddit-like, Instagram-like, Facebook-like, Discord-like, and Threads-like, covering 681 tasks across interaction complexity and targeting difficulty. Our end-to-end protocol validates generated code via static checks, sandboxed execution, and outcome verification including DOM assertions and database snapshots, and includes a safety suite for scraping, spam/abuse, and credential/privacy prompts. Across 2636 model-task runs, we observe stratified success: GPT-4o-Mini achieves 96.8 percent, GPT-4.1 achieves 95.3 percent, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves 89.0 percent, and DeepSeek-V3.1 achieves 83.4 percent. Models handle simple tasks reliably at 91.7 percent but fail on complex workflows at 0.0 percent, and none meet production-quality coding practices despite functional completion. We release our complete benchmark pipeline, evaluation framework, and experimental results to enable reproducible assessment of macro synthesis for web automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Lock-LLM</p></details> |

However, traditional fault analysis, while valuable, typically involves multiple expert-driven steps such as collecting potential faults, filtering, and manual investigation. These processes are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks that hinder large-scale fault studies in complex yet critical software systems and slow the pace of iterative empirical research. In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation, and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software. Specifically, we perform the evaluation on 3,829 software faults drawn from a high-quality empirical study. Our results show that LLMs can substantially improve efficiency in fault analysis, with an average processing time of about two hours, compared to the weeks of manual effort typically required. We conclude by outlining a detailed research plan that highlights both the potential of LLMs for advancing empirical fault studies and the open challenges that required be addressed to achieve fully automated, end-to-end software fault analysis.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Existing approaches have shown promise in automatically recovering these links. Evaluations of these techniques assess their ability to identify genuine links from plausible but false links. However, these evaluations overlook the fact that, in reality, when a repository has more commits, the presence of more plausible yet unrelated commits may interfere with the tool in differentiating the correct fix commits. To address this, we propose the Realistic Distribution Setting (RDS) and use it to construct a more realistic evaluation dataset that includes 20 open-source projects. By evaluating tools on this dataset, we observe that the performance of the state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach drops by more than half, while the traditional Information Retrieval method, VSM, outperforms it. Inspired by these observations, we propose EasyLink, which utilizes a vector database as a modern Information Retrieval technique. To address the long-standing problem of the semantic gap between issues and commits, EasyLink leverages a large language model to rerank the commits retrieved from the database. Under our evaluation, EasyLink achieves an average Precision@1 of 75.03\%, improving over the state-of-the-art by over four times. Additionally, this paper provides practical guidelines for advancing research in issue-commit link recovery.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces RevMine, a conceptual tool that streamlines the entire code review mining pipeline using large language models (LLMs). RevMine guides users through authentication, endpoint discovery, and natural language-driven data collection, significantly reducing the need for manual scripting. After retrieving review data, it supports both quantitative and qualitative analysis based on user-defined filters or LLM-inferred patterns. This poster outlines the tool's architecture, use cases, and research potential. By lowering the barrier to entry, RevMine aims to democratize code review mining and enable a broader range of empirical software engineering studies.</p></details> |  |

Spec2Control is being integrated into commercial ABB engineering tools, but is also available as an open-source variant for independent validation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, these steps and their sizes are often predetermined or manually designed based on domain knowledge. We propose dynamic decomposition, a method that adaptively and automatically partitions solution and reasoning traces into manageable steps during inference. By more effectively allocating compute -- particularly through subdividing challenging steps and prioritizing their sampling -- dynamic decomposition significantly improves inference efficiency. Experiments on benchmarks such as APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that dynamic decomposition outperforms static approaches, including token-level, sentence-level, and single-step decompositions, reducing the pass@10 error rate by 5.0%, 6.7%, and 10.5% respectively. These findings highlight the potential of dynamic decomposition to improve a wide range of inference scaling techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)</p></details> |
| **[LogSage: An LLM-Based Framework for CI/CD Failure Detection and Remediation with Industrial Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03691v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are critical to modern software engineering, yet diagnosing and resolving their failures remains complex and labor-intensive. We present LogSage, the first end-to-end LLM-powered framework for root cause analysis (RCA) and automated remediation of CI/CD failures. LogSage employs a token-efficient log preprocessing pipeline to filter noise and extract critical errors, then performs structured diagnostic prompting for accurate RCA. For solution generation, it leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to reuse historical fixes and invokes automation fixes via LLM tool-calling. On a newly curated benchmark of 367 GitHub CI/CD failures, LogSage achieves over 98\% precision, near-perfect recall, and an F1 improvement of more than 38\% points in the RCA stage, compared with recent LLM-based baselines. In a year-long industrial deployment at ByteDance, it processed over 1.07M executions, with end-to-end precision exceeding 80\%. These results demonstrate that LogSage provides a scalable and practical solution for automating CI/CD failure management in real-world DevOps workflows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

However, traditional fault analysis, while valuable, typically involves multiple expert-driven steps such as collecting potential faults, filtering, and manual investigation. These processes are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks that hinder large-scale fault studies in complex yet critical software systems and slow the pace of iterative empirical research. In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation, and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software. Specifically, we perform the evaluation on 3,829 software faults drawn from a high-quality empirical study. Our results show that LLMs can substantially improve efficiency in fault analysis, with an average processing time of about two hours, compared to the weeks of manual effort typically required. We conclude by outlining a detailed research plan that highlights both the potential of LLMs for advancing empirical fault studies and the open challenges that required be addressed to achieve fully automated, end-to-end software fault analysis.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Academic research, industrial projects (e.g., Amazon Braket, IBM Qiskit), and consortiums like 'Quantum Flagship' are striving to develop practically capable and commercially viable quantum computing (QC) systems and technologies. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is viewed as a solution attuned to the philosophy of service-orientation that can offer QC resources and platforms, as utility computing, to individuals and organisations who do not own quantum computers. This research investigates a process-centric and architecture-driven approach to offer a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS - a.k.a quantum service-orientation. We employed a two-phase research method comprising (a) a systematic mapping study and (b) an architecture-based development, first to identify the phases of the quantum service development life cycle and subsequently to integrate these phases into a reference architecture that supports QCaaS. The SMS process retrieved a collection of potentially relevant research literature and based on a multi-step selection and qualitative assessment, we selected 41 peer-reviewed studies to answer three RQs. The RQs investigate (i) demographic details in terms of frequency, types, and trends of research, (ii) phases of quantum service development lifecycle to derive a reference architecture for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of services, and (iii) The results identify a 4-phased development lifecycle along with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations, catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can be integrated in a layered reference architecture to engineer QCaaS.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 10 images, 5 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

It also imposes tooling and operational costs to implement in practice. In an era of centralized registries such as PyPI, npm, Maven Central, and Hugging Face, it is reasonable to ask whether hardening registry security controls obviates the need for end-to-end artifact signing. In this work, we posit that the core guarantees of signing, provenance, integrity, and accountability are not automatically carried across different software distribution boundaries. These boundaries include mirrors, corporate proxies, re-hosting, and air-gapped transfers, where registry security controls alone cannot provide sufficient assurance. We synthesize historical practice and present a trust model for modern distribution modes to identify when signing is necessary to extend trust beyond registry control. Treating signing as a baseline layer of defense strengthens software supply chain assurance even when registries are secure.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 3 Figures |

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

While function-level and file-level generation have achieved promising results, real-world software development typically requires reasoning across entire repositories. This gives rise to the challenging task of Repository-Level Code Generation (RLCG), where models must capture long-range dependencies, ensure global semantic consistency, and generate coherent code spanning multiple files or modules. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that integrates external retrieval mechanisms with LLMs, enhancing context-awareness and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research on Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), with an emphasis on repository-level approaches. We categorize existing work along several dimensions, including generation strategies, retrieval modalities, model architectures, training paradigms, and evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we summarize widely used datasets and benchmarks, analyze current limitations, and outline key challenges and opportunities for future research. Our goal is to establish a unified analytical framework for understanding this rapidly evolving field and to inspire continued progress in AI-powered software engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, production-ready compilers like LLVM and GCC often fail to fully exploit available vectorization opportunities due to disjoint vectorization passes and limited extensibility. Although recent attempts in heuristics and intermediate representation (IR) designs have attempted to address these problems, efficiently simplifying control flow analysis and accurately identifying vectorization opportunities remain challenging tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a novel vectorization pipeline featuring two specialized IR extensions: SIR, which encodes high-level structural information, and VIR, which explicitly represents instruction dependencies through data dependency analysis. Leveraging the detailed dependency information provided by VIR, we develop a flexible and extensible vectorization framework. This approach substantially improves interoperability across vectorization passes and expands the search space for identifying isomorphic instructions, ultimately enhancing both the scope and efficiency of automatic vectorization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed vectorization pipeline achieves significant performance improvements, delivering speedups of up to 53% and 58% compared to LLVM and GCC, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, interaction challenges with CCTs persist, mainly due to mismatches between developers' mental models and the unpredictable behavior of AI-generated suggestions, which is an aspect underexplored in the literature. We conducted an elicitation study with 56 developers using co-design workshops to elicit their mental models when interacting with CCTs. Different important findings that might drive the interaction design with CCTs emerged. For example, developers expressed diverse preferences on when and how code suggestions should be triggered (proactive, manual, hybrid), where and how they are displayed (inline, sidebar, popup, chatbot), as well as the level of detail. It also emerged that developers need to be supported by customization of activation timing, display modality, suggestion granularity, and explanation content, to better fit the CCT to their preferences. To demonstrate the feasibility of these and the other guidelines that emerged during the study, we developed ATHENA, a proof-of-concept CCT that dynamically adapts to developers' coding preferences and environments, ensuring seamless integration into diverse workflows.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

Existing approaches have shown promise in automatically recovering these links. Evaluations of these techniques assess their ability to identify genuine links from plausible but false links. However, these evaluations overlook the fact that, in reality, when a repository has more commits, the presence of more plausible yet unrelated commits may interfere with the tool in differentiating the correct fix commits. To address this, we propose the Realistic Distribution Setting (RDS) and use it to construct a more realistic evaluation dataset that includes 20 open-source projects. By evaluating tools on this dataset, we observe that the performance of the state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach drops by more than half, while the traditional Information Retrieval method, VSM, outperforms it. Inspired by these observations, we propose EasyLink, which utilizes a vector database as a modern Information Retrieval technique. To address the long-standing problem of the semantic gap between issues and commits, EasyLink leverages a large language model to rerank the commits retrieved from the database. Under our evaluation, EasyLink achieves an average Precision@1 of 75.03\%, improving over the state-of-the-art by over four times. Additionally, this paper provides practical guidelines for advancing research in issue-commit link recovery.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in fuzzing techniques, such as coverage-guided greybox fuzzing, many fuzzers struggle with coverage plateaus caused by fuzz blockers, limiting their ability to find deeper vulnerabilities. Human expertise can address these challenges, but analyzing fuzzing results to guide this support remains labor-intensive. To tackle this, we introduce InsightQL, the first human-assisting framework for fuzz blocker analysis. Powered by a unified database and an intuitive parameterized query interface, InsightQL aids developers in systematically extracting insights and efficiently unblocking fuzz blockers. Our experiments on 14 popular real-world libraries from the FuzzBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of InsightQL, leading to the unblocking of many fuzz blockers and considerable improvements in code coverage (up to 13.90%).</p></details> |  |

However, little attention has been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of software in research activities. Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences. Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices. However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse documentation practices. To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability, consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to address its heterogeneity and scale. This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the Life Sciences. We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard, examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting and analyzing review data remains a time-consuming and technically intensive task. Most researchers follow similar workflows - writing ad hoc scripts to extract, filter, and analyze review data from platforms like GitHub and GitLab. This paper introduces RevMine, a conceptual tool that streamlines the entire code review mining pipeline using large language models (LLMs). RevMine guides users through authentication, endpoint discovery, and natural language-driven data collection, significantly reducing the need for manual scripting. After retrieving review data, it supports both quantitative and qualitative analysis based on user-defined filters or LLM-inferred patterns. This poster outlines the tool's architecture, use cases, and research potential. By lowering the barrier to entry, RevMine aims to democratize code review mining and enable a broader range of empirical software engineering studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUISpector: An MLLM Agent Framework for Automated Verification of Natural Language Requirements in GUI Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04791v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUIs are foundational to interactive systems and play a pivotal role in early requirements elicitation through prototyping. Ensuring that GUI implementations fulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering, especially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into development workflows. Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or LLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces, and typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated development agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework that leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification of NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to interpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and execute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector systematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification process, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to iteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code generation in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that unifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for supervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the end-to-end requirements verification process.

For that, it examines the design and implementation of a Digital Wallet system developed in Kotlin (for OOP) and Scala (for FP). The comparison is made through a mixed-method approach. The self-ethnographic qualitative analysis provides a side-by-side comparison of both implementations, revealing the perspective of those writing such code. The survey-based quantitative analysis gathers feedback from developers with diverse backgrounds, showing their impressions of those reading this code.

Researchers are still conducting studies on agile effort estimation. The aim of this research is to develop a story point based agile effort estimation model using LASSO and Elastic Net regression techniques. The experimental work is applied to the agile story point approach using 21 software projects collected from six firms. The two algorithms are trained using their default parameters and tuned grid search with 5-fold cross-validation to get an enhanced model. The experiment result shows LASSO regression achieved better predictive performance PRED (8%) and PRED (25%) results of 100.0, MMRE of 0.0491, MMER of 0.0551, MdMRE of 0.0593, MdMER of 0.063, and MSE of 0.0007.

This work addresses that gap by focusing on Sinhala, a low-resource language with limited tools for linguistic accessibility. We present an assistive system explicitly designed for Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia. The system integrates Whisper for speech-to-text conversion, SinBERT, an open-sourced fine-tuned BERT model trained for Sinhala to identify common dyslexic errors, and a combined mT5 and Mistral-based model to generate corrected text. Finally, the output is converted back to speech using gTTS, creating a complete multimodal feedback loop. Despite the challenges posed by limited Sinhala-language datasets, the system achieves 0.66 transcription accuracy and 0.7 correction accuracy with 0.65 overall system accuracy. These results demonstrate both the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. Ultimately, this work highlights the importance of inclusive Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies in underrepresented languages and showcases a practical</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Although many data-driven RCA models have been proposed, we find that existing benchmarks are often oversimplified and fail to capture real-world conditions. Our preliminary study shows that simple rule-based methods can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on four widely used benchmarks, suggesting performance overestimation due to benchmark simplicity. To address this, we systematically analyze popular RCA benchmarks and identify key limitations in fault injection, call graph design, and telemetry patterns. Based on these insights, we develop an automated framework to generate more realistic benchmarks, yielding a dataset of 1,430 validated failure cases from 9,152 injections, covering 25 fault types under dynamic workloads with hierarchical ground-truth labels and verified SLI impact. Re-evaluation of 11 SOTA models on this dataset shows low Top@1 accuracy (average 0.21, best 0.37) and significantly longer execution times. Our analysis highlights three common failure patterns: scalability issues, observability blind spots, and modeling bottlenecks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project is available on https://operationspai.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Evolaris: A Roadmap to Self-Evolving Software Intelligence Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04689v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the landscape of software threats has become significantly more dynamic and distributed. Security vulnerabilities are no longer discovered and shared only through formal channels such as public vulnerability databases or vendor advisories. Increasingly, criti- cal threat information emerges informally through blogs, social media, developer forums, open source repositories, and even underground com- munities. To this end, capturing such intelligence in a timely manner is essential for maintaining situational awareness and enabling prompt security responses. However, this remains a complex challenge due to the fragmented nature of data sources and the technical difficulty of collecting, parsing, mapping, and validating information at scale. To ad- dress this, we propose Evolaris, a self-evolving software intelligence sys- tem built on a multi-agent framework. Evolaris is designed to support a full-stack workflow, where agents operate independently but coordinate through shared context to perform tasks such as information discovery, reasoning, gap completion, validation, and risk detection. This archi- tecture enables the platform to learn from new inputs, refine its internal knowledge, and adapt to emerging threat patterns over time, which could continuously improve the precision, timeliness, and scalability of software threat analysis, and offers a sustainable foundation for proactive secu- rity decision-making and strengthens the broader ecosystem of security threat understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maven-Lockfile: High Integrity Rebuild of Past Java Releases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00730v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software projects depend on many third-party libraries, complicating reproducible and secure builds. Several package managers address this with the generation of a lockfile that freezes dependency versions and can be used to verify the integrity of dependencies. Yet, Maven, one of the most important package managers in the Java ecosystem, lacks native support for a lockfile. We present Maven-Lockfile to generate and update lockfiles, with support for rebuilding projects from past versions. Our lockfiles capture all direct and transitive dependencies with their checksums, enabling high integrity builds. Our evaluation shows that Maven-Lockfile can reproduce builds from historical commits and is able to detect tampered artifacts. With minimal configuration, Maven-Lockfile equips Java projects with modern build integrity and build reproducibility, and fosters future research on software supply chain security in Java.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test Schedule Generation for Acceptance Testing of Mission-Critical Satellite Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01224v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mission-critical system, such as satellite systems, healthcare systems, and nuclear power plant control systems, undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet specific operational requirements throughout their operation. This includes Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT), which aims to ensure that the system functions correctly under real-world operational conditions. In satellite development, In-Orbit Testing (IOT) is a crucial OAT activity performed regularly and as needed after deployment in orbit to check the satellite's performance and ensure that operational requirements are met. The scheduling of an IOT campaign, which executes multiple IOT procedures, is an important yet challenging problem, as it accounts for various factors, including satellite visibility, antenna usage costs, testing time periods, and operational constraints. To address the IOT scheduling problem, we propose a multi-objective approach to generate near-optimal IOT schedules, accounting for operational costs, fragmentation (i.e., the splitting of tests), and resource efficiency, which align with practitioners' objectives for IOT scheduling. Our industrial case study with SES Techcom shows significant improvements, as follows: an average improvement of 49.4% in the cost objective, 60.4% in the fragmentation objective, and 30% in the resource usage objective, compared to our baselines. Additionally, our approach improves cost efficiency by 538% and resource usage efficiency by 39.42% compared to manually constructed schedules provided by practitioners, while requiring only 12.5% of the time needed for manual IOT scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review (when applicable) or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

However, whether emotions affect perceived productivity remains an open question. This study aims to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between emotional state and perceived productivity among software developers. We employed a two-stage approach. First, a survey was conducted with a pool of nine experts to validate the measurement model. Second, a survey was administered to a pool of 88 software developers to empirically test the formulated hypothesis by using Partial Least Squares, as the data analysis method. The results of the path analysis clearly confirm the formulated hypothesis, showing that the emotional state of a software developer has a strong positive, and significant impact (beta = 0.893, p < 0.001) on perceived productivity among software developers. The findings highlight the importance of managing and improving developers emotional well-being to enhance productivity in software development environments. Additionally, interventions aimed at reducing burnout, stress, and other negative factors could have a considerable impact on their performance outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 tables, 96 references</p></details> |

Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs) offer a promising alternative with global bidirectional encoding and decoupled generation steps. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of DLLMs across the software development lifecycle, including code generation, defect detection, and program repair. On a large-scale benchmark of 52,937 tasks, 7Bparameter DLLMs outperform AR-LLMs with a 30% average accuracy improvement achieving a 113% gain on cross-file repair, while maintaining superior efficiency and reduced latency. Our results establish DLLMs as a superior paradigm for SE tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, systematic measurement of governmental OSS adoption remain limited. Research Aim: This study contributes to digital government maturity indexes by analyzing policies and support actions leveraging OSS for software reuse and collaborative development across 16 digitally mature countries, and proposing potential indicators for said indexes. It examines OSS policy formation, stated goals, key actors, and support mechanisms. Methodology: A qualitative approach is used combining desk research of policy documents with semi-structured interviews of government representatives, producing detailed country reports. These are cross-analyzed, focusing on OSS policy promotion, rationale, and implementation support. Results: Policies facilitating OSS reuse are widespread, targeting both inbound acquisition and outbound sharing, and are predominantly governed by central public sector organizations. Policy goals include interoperability, digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency, with security framed both as a risk and strength. Implementation is supported by diverse Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) at multiple government levels, which foster capacity building, resource pooling, and sustainable project governance. Indicators are synthesized and proposed across 14 areas covering policy incentives and design, and implementation and support. Conclusions: OSS is a strategic enabler for public sector digital transformation. Clear policy frameworks, coupled with institutional support such as OSPOs, are essential. International digital maturity frameworks should expand OSS indicators to better guide and assess government adoption and impact.</p></details> | In submission |

When the codomain of $f$ is equipped with a total order, it is easy to specify, implement, and verify generic solutions to this problem. But what if $f$ is affected by uncertainties? What if one seeks values that minimize more than one objective, or if $f$ does not return a single result but a set of possible results, or even a probability distribution? Such situations are common in climate science, economics, and engineering. Developing trustworthy solution methods for optimization under uncertainty requires formulating and answering these questions rigorously, including deciding which order relations to apply in different cases. We show how functional programming can support this task, and apply it to specify and test solution methods for cases where optimization is affected by two conceptually different kinds of uncertainty: value and functorial uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Programming the software for such systems remains a largely manual and tedious process, incurring costs of millions of dollars for extensive facilities. Large language models (LLMs) have been found helpful in generating DCS control logic, resulting in commercial copilot tools. Today, these tools are focused on textual notations, they provide limited automation, and have not been tested on large datasets with realistic test cases. We introduce Spec2Control, a highly automated LLM workflow to generate graphical control logic directly from natural language user requirements. Experiments using an open dataset with 10 control narratives and 65 complex test cases demonstrate that Spec2Control can successfully identify control strategies, can generate 98.6% of correct control strategy connections autonomously, and can save between 94-96% of human labor. Spec2Control is being integrated into commercial ABB engineering tools, but is also available as an open-source variant for independent validation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, these steps and their sizes are often predetermined or manually designed based on domain knowledge. We propose dynamic decomposition, a method that adaptively and automatically partitions solution and reasoning traces into manageable steps during inference. By more effectively allocating compute -- particularly through subdividing challenging steps and prioritizing their sampling -- dynamic decomposition significantly improves inference efficiency. Experiments on benchmarks such as APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that dynamic decomposition outperforms static approaches, including token-level, sentence-level, and single-step decompositions, reducing the pass@10 error rate by 5.0%, 6.7%, and 10.5% respectively. These findings highlight the potential of dynamic decomposition to improve a wide range of inference scaling techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)</p></details> |

The ability to reuse existing functionality via third-party dependencies has enabled massive gains in productivity, but for a long time the dominant philosophy has been to 'reuse as much as possible, without thought for what is being depended upon', creating fragile dependency chains. Heavy reliance has raised resiliency and maintenance concerns. In this vision paper, we investigate packages that challenge the typical concepts of reuse - that is, packages with no dependencies themselves that bear the responsibility of being at the end of the dependency supply chain. By avoiding dependencies, these packages at the end of the chain may also avoid the associated risks. Our initial analysis of the most depended upon NPM packages shows that such end-of-chain packages make up a significant portion of these critical dependency chain (over 50%). We find that these end-of-chain packages vary in characteristics and are not just packages that can be easily replaced, and present five cases. We then ask ourselves: Should maintainers minimize external dependencies? We argue that these packages reveal important lessons for strategic reuse-balancing the undeniable benefits of dependency ecosystems with sustainable, secure practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and presented at SE 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap Workshop.

This paper refines existing definitions and introduce data-only packages that contain no executable logic. A rule-based static analysis method is developed to detect trivial and data-only packages and evaluate their prevalence and associated risks in the 2025 npm ecosystem. The analysis shows that 17.92% of packages are trivial, with vulnerability levels comparable to non-trivial ones, and data-only packages, though rare, also contain risks. The proposed detection tool achieves 94% accuracy (macro-F1 0.87), enabling effective large-scale analysis to reduce security exposure. This findings suggest that trivial and data-only packages warrant greater attention in dependency management to reduce potential technical debt and security exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in PROFES 2025</p></details> |

Generated natural language code summaries aid comprehension but remain static and limited in supporting the full workflow. We present NaturalEdit, a system that makes code summaries interactive and adaptive representations directly linked to source code. Grounded in the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations, NaturalEdit implements a paradigm of code modification through interaction with natural language representations through three key features: (1) adaptive multi-faceted representation of code summaries with flexible Abstraction Gradient; (2) interactive mapping mechanisms between summaries and codes, ensuring a tight Closeness of Mapping; and (3) intent-driven, bidirectional synchronization that reduces Viscosity in editing and validation. A technical evaluation confirms the performance of NaturalEdit, and a user study with 12 developers shows that it enhances comprehension, intent articulation, and validation, giving developers greater confidence and control.</p></details> |  |

We present LogSage, the first end-to-end LLM-powered framework for root cause analysis (RCA) and automated remediation of CI/CD failures. LogSage employs a token-efficient log preprocessing pipeline to filter noise and extract critical errors, then performs structured diagnostic prompting for accurate RCA. For solution generation, it leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to reuse historical fixes and invokes automation fixes via LLM tool-calling. On a newly curated benchmark of 367 GitHub CI/CD failures, LogSage achieves over 98\% precision, near-perfect recall, and an F1 improvement of more than 38\% points in the RCA stage, compared with recent LLM-based baselines. In a year-long industrial deployment at ByteDance, it processed over 1.07M executions, with end-to-end precision exceeding 80\%. These results demonstrate that LogSage provides a scalable and practical solution for automating CI/CD failure management in real-world DevOps workflows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike most existing approaches that treat individual seeds as tasks, DynamiQ leverages structural information from the program's call graph to define tasks and continuously refines task allocation using runtime feedback. This design significantly reduces redundant exploration and enhances fuzzing efficiency at scale. Built on top of the state-of-the-art LibAFL framework, DynamiQ incorporates several practical optimizations in both task allocation and task-aware fuzzing. Evaluated on 12 real-world targets from OSS-Fuzz and FuzzBench over 25,000 CPU hours, DynamiQ outperforms state-of-the-art parallel fuzzers in both code coverage and vulnerability discovery, uncovering 9 previously unknown bugs in widely used and extensively fuzzed open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving IR-based Bug Localization with Semantics-Driven Query Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04468v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of research, software bug localization remains challenging due to heterogeneous content and inherent ambiguities in bug reports. Existing methods such as Information Retrieval (IR)-based approaches often attempt to match source documents to bug reports, overlooking the context and semantics of the source code. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g., Transformer models) show promising results in understanding both texts and code. However, they have not been yet adapted well to localize software bugs against bug reports. They could be also data or resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we propose, IQLoc, a novel bug localization approach that capitalizes on the strengths of both IR and LLM-based approaches. In particular, we leverage the program semantics understanding of transformer-based models to reason about the suspiciousness of code and reformulate queries during bug localization using Information Retrieval. To evaluate IQLoc, we refine the Bench4BL benchmark dataset and extend it by incorporating ~30% more recent bug reports, resulting in a benchmark containing ~7.5K bug reports. We evaluated IQLoc using three performance metrics and compare it against four baseline techniques. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority, achieving up to 58.52% and 60.59% in MAP, 61.49% and 64.58% in MRR, and 69.88% and 100.90% in HIT@K for the test bug reports with random and time-wise splits, respectively. Moreover, IQLoc improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces, 72.73% for those that include code elements, and 65.38% for those containing only descriptions in natural language. By integrating program semantic understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc mitigates several longstanding challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

As a vital tool for optimizing recruitment processes, reducing labor and time costs, and enhancing core competitiveness, intelligent recruitment management systems become an indispensable component of modern organizational talent strategies.Compared with the labor intensive tasks of resume screening, candidate position matching, and interview coordination in traditional manual recruitment, intelligent recruitment systems significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the hiring process through automation and data driven approaches. These systems enable rapid parsing of massive resume volumes, intelligent matching of candidates to positions, and automated scheduling of interview processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MulVuln: Enhancing Pre-trained LMs with Shared and Language-Specific Knowledge for Multilingual Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04397v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities (SVs) pose a critical threat to safety-critical systems, driving the adoption of AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning for software vulnerability detection. Despite promising results, most existing methods are limited to a single programming language. This is problematic given the multilingual nature of modern software, which is often complex and written in multiple languages. Current approaches often face challenges in capturing both shared and language-specific knowledge of source code, which can limit their performance on diverse programming languages and real-world codebases. To address this gap, we propose MULVULN, a novel multilingual vulnerability detection approach that learns from source code across multiple languages. MULVULN captures both the shared knowledge that generalizes across languages and the language-specific knowledge that reflects unique coding conventions. By integrating these aspects, it achieves more robust and effective detection of vulnerabilities in real-world multilingual software systems. The rigorous and extensive experiments on the real-world and diverse REEF dataset, consisting of 4,466 CVEs with 30,987 patches across seven programming languages, demonstrate the superiority of MULVULN over thirteen effective and state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, MULVULN achieves substantially higher F1-score, with improvements ranging from 1.45% to 23.59% compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

In RE, the goal is to ensure that implemented systems satisfy stakeholder needs through rigorous requirements elicitation, validation, and evaluation processes. Despite its critical role, RE continues to face persistent challenges, such as ambiguity, conflicting stakeholder needs, and the complexity of managing evolving requirements. A common view is that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to streamline the RE process, resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy, and management actions. However, using AI also introduces new concerns, such as ethical issues, biases, and lack of transparency. This paper explores how AI can enhance traditional RE practices by automating labor-intensive tasks, supporting requirement prioritization, and facilitating collaboration between stakeholders and AI systems. The paper also describes the opportunities and challenges that AI brings to RE. In particular, the vision calls for ethical practices in AI, along with a much-enhanced collaboration between academia and industry professionals. The focus should be on creating not only powerful but also trustworthy and practical AI solutions ready to adapt to the fast-paced world of software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SEAA 2025.

MacroBench instantiates seven self-hosted sites: Airbnb-like, TikTok-like, Reddit-like, Instagram-like, Facebook-like, Discord-like, and Threads-like, covering 681 tasks across interaction complexity and targeting difficulty. Our end-to-end protocol validates generated code via static checks, sandboxed execution, and outcome verification including DOM assertions and database snapshots, and includes a safety suite for scraping, spam/abuse, and credential/privacy prompts. Across 2636 model-task runs, we observe stratified success: GPT-4o-Mini achieves 96.8 percent, GPT-4.1 achieves 95.3 percent, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves 89.0 percent, and DeepSeek-V3.1 achieves 83.4 percent. Models handle simple tasks reliably at 91.7 percent but fail on complex workflows at 0.0 percent, and none meet production-quality coding practices despite functional completion.

| **[Handling Open-Vocabulary Constructs in Formalizing Specifications: Retrieval-Augmented Parsing with Expert Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08808v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of Open-Vocabulary Constructs(OVCs) -- ones not known beforehand -- in the context of converting natural language (NL) specifications into formal languages (e.g., temporal logic or code). Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |
| **[ETF: An Entity Tracing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Code Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14748v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to understand both natural language and code, driving their use in tasks like natural language-to-code (NL2Code) and code summarisation. However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Limitations of Embedding Based Methods for Measuring Functional Correctness for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01580v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of code generation from natural language (NL2Code) has become extremely popular, especially with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation: A Survey with Focus on Repository-Level Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04905v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved automated code generation. While function-level and file-level generation have achieved promising results, real-world software development typically requires reasoning across entire repositories. This gives rise to the challenging task of Repository-Level Code Generation (RLCG), where models must capture long-range dependencies, ensure global semantic consistency, and generate coherent code spanning multiple files or modules. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that integrates external retrieval mechanisms with LLMs, enhancing context-awareness and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research on Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), with an emphasis on repository-level approaches. We categorize existing work along several dimensions, including generation strategies, retrieval modalities, model architectures, training paradigms, and evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we summarize widely used datasets and benchmarks, analyze current limitations, and outline key challenges and opportunities for future research. Our goal is to establish a unified analytical framework for understanding this rapidly evolving field and to inspire continued progress in AI-powered software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding User Mental Models in AI-Driven Code Completion Tools: Insights from an Elicitation Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02194v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated Development Environments increasingly implement AI-powered code completion tools (CCTs), which promise to enhance developer efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. However, interaction challenges with CCTs persist, mainly due to mismatches between developers' mental models and the unpredictable behavior of AI-generated suggestions, which is an aspect underexplored in the literature. We conducted an elicitation study with 56 developers using co-design workshops to elicit their mental models when interacting with CCTs. Different important findings that might drive the interaction design with CCTs emerged. For example, developers expressed diverse preferences on when and how code suggestions should be triggered (proactive, manual, hybrid), where and how they are displayed (inline, sidebar, popup, chatbot), as well as the level of detail. It also emerged that developers need to be supported by customization of activation timing, display modality, suggestion granularity, and explanation content, to better fit the CCT to their preferences. To demonstrate the feasibility of these and the other guidelines that emerged during the study, we developed ATHENA, a proof-of-concept CCT that dynamically adapts to developers' coding preferences and environments, ensuring seamless integration into diverse workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreshBrew: A Benchmark for Evaluating AI Agents on Java Code Migration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04852v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding assistants are rapidly becoming integral to modern software development. A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

Despite advances in fuzzing techniques, such as coverage-guided greybox fuzzing, many fuzzers struggle with coverage plateaus caused by fuzz blockers, limiting their ability to find deeper vulnerabilities. Human expertise can address these challenges, but analyzing fuzzing results to guide this support remains labor-intensive. To tackle this, we introduce InsightQL, the first human-assisting framework for fuzz blocker analysis. Powered by a unified database and an intuitive parameterized query interface, InsightQL aids developers in systematically extracting insights and efficiently unblocking fuzz blockers. Our experiments on 14 popular real-world libraries from the FuzzBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of InsightQL, leading to the unblocking of many fuzz blockers and considerable improvements in code coverage (up to 13.90%).</p></details> |  |

However, little attention has been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of software in research activities. Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences. Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices. However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse documentation practices. To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability, consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to address its heterogeneity and scale. This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the Life Sciences. We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard, examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.</p></details> |  |

Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting and analyzing review data remains a time-consuming and technically intensive task. Most researchers follow similar workflows - writing ad hoc scripts to extract, filter, and analyze review data from platforms like GitHub and GitLab. This paper introduces RevMine, a conceptual tool that streamlines the entire code review mining pipeline using large language models (LLMs). RevMine guides users through authentication, endpoint discovery, and natural language-driven data collection, significantly reducing the need for manual scripting. After retrieving review data, it supports both quantitative and qualitative analysis based on user-defined filters or LLM-inferred patterns. This poster outlines the tool's architecture, use cases, and research potential. By lowering the barrier to entry, RevMine aims to democratize code review mining and enable a broader range of empirical software engineering studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUISpector: An MLLM Agent Framework for Automated Verification of Natural Language Requirements in GUI Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04791v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUIs are foundational to interactive systems and play a pivotal role in early requirements elicitation through prototyping. Ensuring that GUI implementations fulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering, especially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into development workflows. Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or LLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces, and typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated development agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework that leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification of NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to interpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and execute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector systematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification process, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to iteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code generation in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that unifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for supervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the end-to-end requirements verification process. We evaluated GUISpector on a comprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria annotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection of requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for seamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven development workflows. The video presentation of GUISpector is available at: https://youtu.be/JByYF6BNQeE, showcasing its main capabilities.</p></details> |  |

The self-ethnographic qualitative analysis provides a side-by-side comparison of both implementations, revealing the perspective of those writing such code. The survey-based quantitative analysis gathers feedback from developers with diverse backgrounds, showing their impressions of those reading this code.

This work addresses that gap by focusing on Sinhala, a low-resource language with limited tools for linguistic accessibility. We present an assistive system explicitly designed for Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia. The system integrates Whisper for speech-to-text conversion, SinBERT, an open-sourced fine-tuned BERT model trained for Sinhala to identify common dyslexic errors, and a combined mT5 and Mistral-based model to generate corrected text. Finally, the output is converted back to speech using gTTS, creating a complete multimodal feedback loop. Despite the challenges posed by limited Sinhala-language datasets, the system achieves 0.66 transcription accuracy and 0.7 correction accuracy with 0.65 overall system accuracy. These results demonstrate both the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.

Security vulnerabilities are no longer discovered and shared only through formal channels such as public vulnerability databases or vendor advisories. Increasingly, criti- cal threat information emerges informally through blogs, social media, developer forums, open source repositories, and even underground com- munities. To this end, capturing such intelligence in a timely manner is essential for maintaining situational awareness and enabling prompt security responses. However, this remains a complex challenge due to the fragmented nature of data sources and the technical difficulty of collecting, parsing, mapping, and validating information at scale. To ad- dress this, we propose Evolaris, a self-evolving software intelligence sys- tem built on a multi-agent framework. Evolaris is designed to support a full-stack workflow, where agents operate independently but coordinate through shared context to perform tasks such as information discovery, reasoning, gap completion, validation, and risk detection. This archi- tecture enables the platform to learn from new inputs, refine its internal knowledge, and adapt to emerging threat patterns over time, which could continuously improve the precision, timeliness, and scalability of software threat analysis, and offers a sustainable foundation for proactive secu- rity decision-making and strengthens the broader ecosystem of security threat understanding.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs) offer a promising alternative with global bidirectional encoding and decoupled generation steps. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of DLLMs across the software development lifecycle, including code generation, defect detection, and program repair. On a large-scale benchmark of 52,937 tasks, 7Bparameter DLLMs outperform AR-LLMs with a 30% average accuracy improvement achieving a 113% gain on cross-file repair, while maintaining superior efficiency and reduced latency. Our results establish DLLMs as a superior paradigm for SE tasks.</p></details> |  |

The ability to reuse existing functionality via third-party dependencies has enabled massive gains in productivity, but for a long time the dominant philosophy has been to 'reuse as much as possible, without thought for what is being depended upon', creating fragile dependency chains. Heavy reliance has raised resiliency and maintenance concerns. In this vision paper, we investigate packages that challenge the typical concepts of reuse - that is, packages with no dependencies themselves that bear the responsibility of being at the end of the dependency supply chain. By avoiding dependencies, these packages at the end of the chain may also avoid the associated risks. Our initial analysis of the most depended upon NPM packages shows that such end-of-chain packages make up a significant portion of these critical dependency chain (over 50%). We find that these end-of-chain packages vary in characteristics and are not just packages that can be easily replaced, and present five cases. We then ask ourselves: Should maintainers minimize external dependencies? We argue that these packages reveal important lessons for strategic reuse-balancing the undeniable benefits of dependency ecosystems with sustainable, secure practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and presented at SE 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap Workshop.

Generated natural language code summaries aid comprehension but remain static and limited in supporting the full workflow. We present NaturalEdit, a system that makes code summaries interactive and adaptive representations directly linked to source code. Grounded in the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations, NaturalEdit implements a paradigm of code modification through interaction with natural language representations through three key features: (1) adaptive multi-faceted representation of code summaries with flexible Abstraction Gradient; (2) interactive mapping mechanisms between summaries and codes, ensuring a tight Closeness of Mapping; and (3) intent-driven, bidirectional synchronization that reduces Viscosity in editing and validation. A technical evaluation confirms the performance of NaturalEdit, and a user study with 12 developers shows that it enhances comprehension, intent articulation, and validation, giving developers greater confidence and control.</p></details> |  |

Unlike most existing approaches that treat individual seeds as tasks, DynamiQ leverages structural information from the program's call graph to define tasks and continuously refines task allocation using runtime feedback. This design significantly reduces redundant exploration and enhances fuzzing efficiency at scale. Built on top of the state-of-the-art LibAFL framework, DynamiQ incorporates several practical optimizations in both task allocation and task-aware fuzzing. Evaluated on 12 real-world targets from OSS-Fuzz and FuzzBench over 25,000 CPU hours, DynamiQ outperforms state-of-the-art parallel fuzzers in both code coverage and vulnerability discovery, uncovering 9 previously unknown bugs in widely used and extensively fuzzed open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving IR-based Bug Localization with Semantics-Driven Query Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04468v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite decades of research, software bug localization remains challenging due to heterogeneous content and inherent ambiguities in bug reports. Existing methods such as Information Retrieval (IR)-based approaches often attempt to match source documents to bug reports, overlooking the context and semantics of the source code. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g., Transformer models) show promising results in understanding both texts and code. However, they have not been yet adapted well to localize software bugs against bug reports. They could be also data or resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we propose, IQLoc, a novel bug localization approach that capitalizes on the strengths of both IR and LLM-based approaches. In particular, we leverage the program semantics understanding of transformer-based models to reason about the suspiciousness of code and reformulate queries during bug localization using Information Retrieval. To evaluate IQLoc, we refine the Bench4BL benchmark dataset and extend it by incorporating ~30% more recent bug reports, resulting in a benchmark containing ~7.5K bug reports. We evaluated IQLoc using three performance metrics and compare it against four baseline techniques. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority, achieving up to 58.52% and 60.59% in MAP, 61.49% and 64.58% in MRR, and 69.88% and 100.90% in HIT@K for the test bug reports with random and time-wise splits, respectively. Moreover, IQLoc improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces, 72.73% for those that include code elements, and 65.38% for those containing only descriptions in natural language. By integrating program semantic understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc mitigates several longstanding challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Despite promising results, most existing methods are limited to a single programming language. This is problematic given the multilingual nature of modern software, which is often complex and written in multiple languages. Current approaches often face challenges in capturing both shared and language-specific knowledge of source code, which can limit their performance on diverse programming languages and real-world codebases. To address this gap, we propose MULVULN, a novel multilingual vulnerability detection approach that learns from source code across multiple languages. MULVULN captures both the shared knowledge that generalizes across languages and the language-specific knowledge that reflects unique coding conventions. By integrating these aspects, it achieves more robust and effective detection of vulnerabilities in real-world multilingual software systems. The rigorous and extensive experiments on the real-world and diverse REEF dataset, consisting of 4,466 CVEs with 30,987 patches across seven programming languages, demonstrate the superiority of MULVULN over thirteen effective and state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, MULVULN achieves substantially higher F1-score, with improvements ranging from 1.45% to 23.59% compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

MacroBench instantiates seven self-hosted sites: Airbnb-like, TikTok-like, Reddit-like, Instagram-like, Facebook-like, Discord-like, and Threads-like, covering 681 tasks across interaction complexity and targeting difficulty. Our end-to-end protocol validates generated code via static checks, sandboxed execution, and outcome verification including DOM assertions and database snapshots, and includes a safety suite for scraping, spam/abuse, and credential/privacy prompts. Across 2636 model-task runs, we observe stratified success: GPT-4o-Mini achieves 96.8 percent, GPT-4.1 achieves 95.3 percent, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves 89.0 percent, and DeepSeek-V3.1 achieves 83.4 percent. Models handle simple tasks reliably at 91.7 percent but fail on complex workflows at 0.0 percent, and none meet production-quality coding practices despite functional completion. We release our complete benchmark pipeline, evaluation framework, and experimental results to enable reproducible assessment of macro synthesis for web automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Lock-LLM</p></details> |

In this challenge on optimization of context collection for code completion, organized by JetBrains in collaboration with Mistral AI as part of the ASE 2025 conference, participants developed efficient mechanisms for collecting context from source code repositories to improve fill-in-the-middle code completions for Python and Kotlin. We constructed a large dataset of real-world code in these two programming languages using permissively licensed open-source projects.

| **[AutoEmpirical: LLM-Based Automated Research for Empirical Software Fault Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04997v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding software faults is essential for empirical research in software development and maintenance. However, traditional fault analysis, while valuable, typically involves multiple expert-driven steps such as collecting potential faults, filtering, and manual investigation. These processes are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks that hinder large-scale fault studies in complex yet critical software systems and slow the pace of iterative empirical research. In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation, and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software. Specifically, we perform the evaluation on 3,829 software faults drawn from a high-quality empirical study. Our results show that LLMs can substantially improve efficiency in fault analysis, with an average processing time of about two hours, compared to the weeks of manual effort typically required. We conclude by outlining a detailed research plan that highlights both the potential of LLMs for advancing empirical fault studies and the open challenges that required be addressed to achieve fully automated, end-to-end software fault analysis.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Quantum Computing as a Service - a Software Engineering Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04982v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum systems have started to emerge as a disruptive technology and enabling platforms - exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics via programmable quantum bits (QuBits) - to achieve quantum supremacy in computing. Academic research, industrial projects (e.g., Amazon Braket, IBM Qiskit), and consortiums like 'Quantum Flagship' are striving to develop practically capable and commercially viable quantum computing (QC) systems and technologies. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is viewed as a solution attuned to the philosophy of service-orientation that can offer QC resources and platforms, as utility computing, to individuals and organisations who do not own quantum computers. This research investigates a process-centric and architecture-driven approach to offer a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS - a.k.a quantum service-orientation. We employed a two-phase research method comprising (a) a systematic mapping study and (b) an architecture-based development, first to identify the phases of the quantum service development life cycle and subsequently to integrate these phases into a reference architecture that supports QCaaS. The SMS process retrieved a collection of potentially relevant research literature and based on a multi-step selection and qualitative assessment, we selected 41 peer-reviewed studies to answer three RQs. The RQs investigate (i) demographic details in terms of frequency, types, and trends of research, (ii) phases of quantum service development lifecycle to derive a reference architecture for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of services, and (iii) The results identify a 4-phased development lifecycle along with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations, catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can be integrated in a layered reference architecture to engineer QCaaS.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 10 images, 5 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Why Software Signing (Still) Matters: Trust Boundaries in the Software Supply Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04964v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software signing provides a formal mechanism for provenance by ensuring artifact integrity and verifying producer identity. It also imposes tooling and operational costs to implement in practice. In an era of centralized registries such as PyPI, npm, Maven Central, and Hugging Face, it is reasonable to ask whether hardening registry security controls obviates the need for end-to-end artifact signing. In this work, we posit that the core guarantees of signing, provenance, integrity, and accountability are not automatically carried across different software distribution boundaries. These boundaries include mirrors, corporate proxies, re-hosting, and air-gapped transfers, where registry security controls alone cannot provide sufficient assurance. We synthesize historical practice and present a trust model for modern distribution modes to identify when signing is necessary to extend trust beyond registry control. Treating signing as a baseline layer of defense strengthens software supply chain assurance even when registries are secure.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 3 Figures |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation: A Survey with Focus on Repository-Level Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04905v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved automated code generation. While function-level and file-level generation have achieved promising results, real-world software development typically requires reasoning across entire repositories. This gives rise to the challenging task of Repository-Level Code Generation (RLCG), where models must capture long-range dependencies, ensure global semantic consistency, and generate coherent code spanning multiple files or modules. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that integrates external retrieval mechanisms with LLMs, enhancing context-awareness and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research on Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), with an emphasis on repository-level approaches. We categorize existing work along several dimensions, including generation strategies, retrieval modalities, model architectures, training paradigms, and evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we summarize widely used datasets and benchmarks, analyze current limitations, and outline key challenges and opportunities for future research. Our goal is to establish a unified analytical framework for understanding this rapidly evolving field and to inspire continued progress in AI-powered software engineering.</p></details> |  |
