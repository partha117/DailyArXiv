| **[Beyond Postconditions: Can Large Language Models infer Formal Contracts for Automatic Software Verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12702v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software verifiers have become increasingly effective at the task of checking software against (formal) specifications. Yet, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to be false alarms. To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software verifiers to catch real-world bugs.</p></details> | under submission |

Prior literature focused on how data protection regulations are discussed for software in operation, or how this topic is discussed in various channels outside of the software development process. Yet, what is missing, is a perspective on the impact of such regulations on the software development process. In our work, we address this gap, and explore how discussions during the development of software are impacted by regulations, who reports and discusses issues related to personal data and data protection, and how developers react to those issues. To that end, we used inductive coding to analyze 652 issues from Open Source GitHub projects and used the codes to quantitatively analyze the relation between the roles, resolutions, and data protection issues to understand correlations and predict resolutions of issues. Most notably we observed a significant increase in reporting when GDPR came into effect. The most common issue types were feature requests for privacy enhancement, which were mainly reported and discussed by frequent reporters and frequent committers. But especially issues regarding privacy enhancement were also frequently reported by one-time reporters. Most of the requests were solved without opposing votes. All in all, our findings indicate that data protection regulations effectively start discussions about privacy within the software development community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |
| **[Can ChatGPT support software verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |
| **[Cottontail: Large Language Model-Driven Concolic Execution for Highly Structured Test Input Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17542v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we perform concolic execution to generate highly structured test inputs for systematically testing parsing programs? Existing concolic execution engines are significantly restricted by (1) input structure-agnostic path constraint selection, leading to the waste of testing effort or missing coverage; (2) limited constraint-solving capability, yielding many syntactically invalid test inputs; (3) reliance on manual acquisition of highly structured seed inputs, resulting in non-continuous testing. This paper proposes Cottontail, a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven concolic execution engine, to mitigate the above limitations. A more complete program path representation, named Expressive Structural Coverage Tree (ESCT), is first constructed to select structure-aware path constraints. Later, an LLM-driven constraint solver based on a Solve-Complete paradigm is designed to solve the path constraints smartly to get test inputs that are not only satisfiable to the constraints but also valid to the input syntax. Finally, a history-guided seed acquisition is employed to obtain new highly structured test inputs either before testing starts or after testing is saturated. We implemented Cottontail on top of SymCC and evaluated eight extensively tested open-source libraries across four different formats (XML, SQL, JavaScript, and JSON). Cottontail significantly outperforms baseline approaches by 30.73% and 41.32% on average in terms of line and branch coverage. Besides, Cottontail found six previously unknown vulnerabilities (six CVEs assigned). We have reported these issues to developers, and four out of them have been fixed so far.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the 2026 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (22 pages, with detailed Appendix)</p></details> |
| **[The EmpathiSEr: Development and Validation of Software Engineering Oriented Empathy Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12546v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empathy plays a critical role in software engineering (SE), influencing collaboration, communication, and user-centred design. Although SE research has increasingly recognised empathy as a key human aspect, there remains no validated instrument specifically designed to measure it within the unique socio-technical contexts of SE. Existing generic empathy scales, while well-established in psychology and healthcare, often rely on language, scenarios, and assumptions that are not meaningful or interpretable for software practitioners. These scales fail to account for the diverse, role-specific, and domain-bound expressions of empathy in SE, such as understanding a non-technical user's frustrations or another practitioner's technical constraints, which differ substantially from empathy in clinical or everyday contexts. To address this gap, we developed and validated two domain-specific empathy scales: EmpathiSEr-P, assessing empathy among practitioners, and EmpathiSEr-U, capturing practitioner empathy towards users. Grounded in a practitioner-informed conceptual framework, the scales encompass three dimensions of empathy: cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and empathic responses. We followed a rigorous, multi-phase methodology, including expert evaluation, cognitive interviews, and two practitioner surveys. The resulting instruments represent the first psychometrically validated empathy scales tailored to SE, offering researchers and practitioners a tool for assessing empathy and designing empathy-enhancing interventions in software teams and user interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MooseAgent: A LLM Based Multi-agent Framework for Automating Moose Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08621v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific computing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing stages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 Figs |

We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code $+$ diff $\rightarrow$ new code), anti-apply (new code $-$ diff $\rightarrow$ old code), and diff generation (new code $-$ old code $\rightarrow$ diff). Instances in the benchmark are triples $\langle \textit{old code}, \textit{new code}, \textit{diff} \rangle$ drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For example, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models in the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and smaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/diff-xyz.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Robustness Evaluation of 3D Obstacle Detection Against Specifications in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13653v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) rely on real-time sensor data, such as cameras and LiDARs, for time-critical decisions using deep neural networks. The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69 AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95% CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90% relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1 inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus 28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%) occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points; arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven, provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis with end-to-end auditability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, link to code repo</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

Our experiments rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, gas 2026 conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |

We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[HotBugs.jar: A Benchmark of Hot Fixes for Time-Critical Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07529v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework, HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting in Practice: Investigating Software Developers' Use of Generative AI Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06000v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has fundamentally transformed software development. Although prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill, existing research focuses primarily on individual techniques rather than software developers' broader workflows. This study presents a systematic investigation of how software engineers integrate GenAI tools into their professional practice through a large-scale survey examining prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across various software engineering tasks. We surveyed 91 software engineers, including 72 active GenAI users, to understand AI usage patterns throughout the development process. Our 14 key findings show that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency strongly correlates with using AI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and code review, and that developers prefer iterative multi-turn conversations to single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable, while complex code generation and debugging present sizable challenges. Our insights provide an empirical baseline of current developer practices, from simple code generation to deeper workflow integration, with actionable insights for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[RedCodeAgent: Automatic Red-teaming Agent against Diverse Code Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02609v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.</p></details> |  |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging approach should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with the tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |

Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap, this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity. Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes. Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts. Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences, necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |
| **[Vibe Coding in Practice: Motivations, Challenges, and a Future Outlook -- a Grey Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00328v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools are transforming software development, especially for novice and non-software developers, by enabling them to write code and build applications faster and with little to no human intervention. Vibe coding is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code. Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101 practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools' outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers, particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping, but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-box Context-free Grammar Inference for Readable & Natural Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26616v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis, reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada, and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large, complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJjFfnxUx0.</p></details> |  |
| **[TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Code Generation with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00083v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress (V2)</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence-Guided Concolic Testing of Transformer Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23806v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an {influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible, pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring, compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that (i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration, and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering potential utility for debugging and model auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Specific Instruction: A Longitudinal Study on Debugging Skill Acquisition and Retention for Novice Programmers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22420v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localization is a critical skill, yet novices often lack systematic approaches. Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps; the impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week longitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract guidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that pairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4). Forty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5). Each session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element containing a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to completion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and strategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to completion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other groups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p < 0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other groups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses showed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants internalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that context-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger retention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions produced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized performance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may bridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more equitable path for novices.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (25 pages for the paper, rest pages are references and appendix). 4 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[SecureAgentBench: Benchmarking Secure Code Generation under Realistic Vulnerability Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22097v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents (SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions, (ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step toward more reliable software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |

Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |

Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment. CoCoMagic offers an efficient, effective, and interpretable way for the differential testing of evolving autonomous systems across versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |

Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |

Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |

A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rethinking Technology Stack Selection with AI Coding Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11132v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now an integral part of software development workflows and are reshaping the whole process. Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[ViScratch: Using Large Language Models and Gameplay Videos for Automated Feedback in Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11065v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based programming environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in programming education, in particular for young learners. While the use of blocks helps prevent syntax errors, semantic bugs remain common and difficult to debug. Existing tools for Scratch debugging rely heavily on predefined rules or user manual inputs, and crucially, they ignore the platform's inherently visual nature. We introduce ViScratch, the first multimodal feedback generation system for Scratch that leverages both the project's block code and its generated gameplay video to diagnose and repair bugs. ViScratch uses a two-stage pipeline: a vision-language model first aligns visual symptoms with code structure to identify a single critical issue, then proposes minimal, abstract syntax tree level repairs that are verified via execution in the Scratch virtual machine. We evaluate ViScratch on a set of real-world Scratch projects against state-of-the-art LLM-based tools and human testers. Results show that gameplay video is a crucial debugging signal: ViScratch substantially outperforms prior tools in both bug identification and repair quality, even without access to project descriptions or goals. This work demonstrates that video can serve as a first-class specification in visual programming environments, opening new directions for LLM-based debugging beyond symbolic code alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Testing and Adapting REST APIs as LLM Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15546v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build autonomous agents that perform complex tasks with external tools, often exposed through APIs in enterprise systems. Direct use of these APIs is difficult due to the complex input schema and verbose responses. Current benchmarks overlook these challenges, leaving a gap in assessing API readiness for agent-driven automation. We present a testing framework that systematically evaluates enterprise APIs when wrapped as Python tools for LLM-based agents. The framework generates data-aware test cases, translates them into natural language instructions, and evaluates whether agents can correctly invoke the tool, handle their inputs, and process its responses. We apply the framework to generate over 2400 test cases across different domains and develop a taxonomy of common errors, including input misinterpretation, output failures, and schema mismatches. We further classify errors to support debugging and tool refinement. Our framework provides a systematic approach to enabling enterprise APIs as reliable tools for agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality, leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging, and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches. Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code, coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators. Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers seeking to balance security with software quality in web application development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Challenging Bug Prediction and Repair Models with Synthetic Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02407v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs are essential in software engineering; many research studies in the past decades have been proposed to detect, localize, and repair bugs in software systems. Effectiveness evaluation of such techniques requires complex bugs, i.e., those that are hard to detect through testing and hard to repair through debugging. From the classic software engineering point of view, a hard-to-repair bug differs from the correct code in multiple locations, making it hard to localize and repair. Hard-to-detect bugs, on the other hand, manifest themselves under specific test inputs and reachability conditions. These two objectives, i.e., generating hard-to-detect and hard-to-repair bugs, are mostly aligned; a bug generation technique can change multiple statements to be covered only under a specific set of inputs. However, these two objectives are conflicting for learning-based techniques: A bug should have a similar code representation to the correct code in the training data to challenge a bug prediction model to distinguish them. The hard-to-repair bug definition remains the same but with a caveat: the more a bug differs from the original code, the more distant their representations are and easier to be detected. We propose BugFarm, to transform arbitrary code into multiple complex bugs. BugFarm leverages LLMs to mutate code in multiple locations (hard-to-repair). To ensure that multiple modifications do not notably change the code representation, BugFarm analyzes the attention of the underlying model and instructs LLMs to only change the least attended locations (hard-to-detect). Our comprehensive evaluation of 435k+ bugs from over 1.9M mutants generated by BUGFARM and two alternative approaches demonstrates our superiority in generating bugs that are hard to detect by learning-based bug prediction approaches and hard-to-repair by state-of-the-art learning-based program repair technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in SCAM 2025</p></details> |

Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIO: Multiverse Debugging in the Face of Input/Output -- Extended Version with Additional Appendices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06845v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution paths within the state space. Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e. states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse, may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is caused by the debugger. This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during regular execution. We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our techniques. As a demonstration of the approach we highlight a color dial built with a Lego Mindstorms motor, and color sensor, providing a tangible example of how our approach enables multiverse debugging for programs running on an STM32 microcontroller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This extended version provides auxiliary material to the article of the same title that will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the PACMPL issue for OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging. While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22 subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs, where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well in repository-level debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures, EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[CFaults: Model-Based Diagnosis for Fault Localization in C Programs with Multiple Test Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09337v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks in software development. Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Large Language Models in Software Engineering Education: A Pilot Study through GitHub Repositories Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04877v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly adopted in software engineering (SE) education, offering both opportunities and challenges. Their adoption requires systematic investigation to ensure responsible integration into curricula. Objective: This doctoral research aims to develop a validated framework for integrating LLMs into SE education through a multi-phase process, including taxonomies development, empirical investigation, and case studies. This paper presents the first empirical step. Method: We conducted a pilot repository mining study of 400 GitHub projects, analyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of motivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8] study. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits), software engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming assistance and debugging support (97 hits) were strongly represented. Demotivators, including plagiarism and IP concerns (385 hits), security, privacy and data integrity (87 hits), and over-reliance on AI in learning (39 hits), also appeared prominently. In contrast, demotivators such as challenges in evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded no hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical validation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes, highlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a comprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE education.</p></details> |  |

While classical software engineering has evolved with various tools and methodologies to tackle such bugs, the emergence of quantum computing presents unique challenges. Quantum software development introduces complexities due to the probabilistic nature of quantum computing, distinct algorithmic primitives, and potential hardware noise. In this paper, we introduce CircInspect, an interactive tool tailored for debugging quantum programs in Python and PennyLane. By leveraging breakpoints and real-time software development features, \toolname~empowers users to analyze isolated quantum circuit components, monitor program output, visualize structural changes, and abstract information to enhance comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the dynamic data dependency of a step that reads a variable $v$ is challenging. It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An experience-based classification of quantum bugs in quantum software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03280v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However, the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong, which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that - unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic quantum debugging strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

| **[A Multi-stage Error Diagnosis for APB Transaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03554v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access, Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Repair of C Programs Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01947v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the repair of C programs. We present a framework that integrates spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT. This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoQuIR: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Code Quality-Aware Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11066v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchTrack: A Comprehensive Analysis of ChatGPT's Influence on Pull Request Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07700v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has introduced new dynamics in software development, particularly within pull request workflows. While prior research has examined the quality of AI-generated code, little is known about how developers actually use these suggestions in real-world collaboration. We analyze 338 pull requests from 255 GitHub repositories containing self-admitted ChatGPT usage, including 645 AI-generated snippets and 3,486 developer-authored patches. We introduce PatchTrack, a tool that classifies whether ChatGPT patches were applied, not applied, or not suggested, enabling fine-grained analysis of AI-assisted decisions. Full adoption of ChatGPT code is rare: the median integration rate was 25%. A qualitative analysis of 89 pull requests with integrated patches revealed recurring patterns of structural integration, selective extraction, and iterative refinement, showing that developers typically treat ChatGPT's output as a starting point rather than a final implementation. Even when code was not directly adopted, ChatGPT influenced workflows through conceptual guidance, documentation, and debugging strategies. Integration decisions were shaped by scope, architectural fit, contributor role, and review norms. This study offers empirical insight into how generative AI is used in collaborative software development, showing that its impact extends beyond patch generation to broader decision-making. Our findings inform the design of AI-assisted tools, clarify patch adoption behavior, and support more transparent and effective use of LLMs in practice.</p></details> | 53 pages, 8 figures |

Therefore, effective and efficient debugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However, the teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in indirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer Science (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way. In this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging that interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance aims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper learning experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be integrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. We developed a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization techniques and large language models. Students can use features like the automated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and executed a small-scale, controlled experiment with eight undergraduate CS students. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the systematic guidance. They rated the automated setting of breakpoints as most effective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the breakpoint explanations. In future, we will extend our concept and implementation, and perform more intensive user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE-NIER 2025</p></details> |

Monitoring through logging a long-standing practice in traditional software offers a potential means for auditing ML applications, as logs provide traceable records of system behavior useful for debugging, performance analysis, and continuous auditing. systematically auditing models for compliance or accountability. The findings underscore the need for enhanced logging practices and tooling that systematically integrate responsible AI metrics. Such practices would support the development of auditable, transparent, and ethically responsible ML systems, aligning with growing regulatory requirements and societal expectations. By highlighting specific deficiencies and opportunities, this work provides actionable guidance for both practitioners and tool developers seeking to strengthen the accountability and trustworthiness of ML applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Did I Do Wrong? Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334v4)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025)</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to be false alarms. To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software verifiers to catch real-world bugs.</p></details> | under submission |
| **[iCodeReviewer: Improving Secure Code Review with Mixture of Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12186v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is an essential process to ensure the quality of software that identifies potential software issues at an early stage of software development. Among all software issues, security issues are the most important to identify, as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions. Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the manual efforts required in the secure code review process. Despite the progress, current automated approaches on secure code review, including static analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automated secure code review approach based on large language models (LLMs). iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-prompts architecture that incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage of security issues. Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a specific security issue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of iCodeReviewer in security issue identification and localization with an F1 of 63.98%. The review comments generated by iCodeReviewer also achieve a high acceptance rate up to 84% when it is deployed in production environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing agent-based methods have two key limitations. First, they lack of procedural knowledge (i.e., how an issue is fixed step-by-step and rationales behind it) to learn and leverage for issue resolution. Second, they rely on massive computational power to blindly explore the solution space. % To address those limitations, we propose Lingxi, an issue resolution framework that leverages procedural knowledge extracted from historical issue-fixing data to guide agents in solving repository-level issues. \ourTool first constructs this knowledge offline through a hierarchical abstraction mechanism, enabling agents to learn the how and why behind a fix, not just the final solution. During online application, it employs a knowledge-driven scaling method that leverages the procedural knowledge of similar issues to intelligently analyze the target issue from multiple perspectives, in sharp contrast to undirected, brute-force exploration. % Lingxi successfully resolves 74.6\% of bugs on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark in Past@1 setting, outperforming five state-of-the-art techniques by a significant margin (5.4\% to 14.9\%). Our comprehensive ablation study confirmed that the success of Lingxi comes directly from its use of procedural knowledge. Without it, the performance gains from scaling alone is negligible. Our qualitative study further shows that the ``design patterns $\&$ coding practices'' is the most critical knowledge aspect, and that the roles of different knowledge aspects switch across different stages (i.e., analysis, planning, and fixing).</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study of Developer Challenges and Resolution Times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11138v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs), such as OpenAI's GPT, are fundamentally transforming the practice of software engineering by enabling the development of \emph{FMware} -- applications and infrastructures built around these models. FMware systems now support tasks such as code generation, natural-language interaction, knowledge integration, and multi-modal content creation, underscoring their disruptive impact on current software engineering workflows. However, the design, implementation, and evolution of FMware present significant new challenges, particularly across cloud-based and on-premise platforms where goals, processes, and tools often diverge from those of traditional software development. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of FMware development across both cloud-based platforms and open-source repositories. We empirically investigate the FMware ecosystem through three focus areas: (1) the most common application domains of FMware, (2) the key challenges developers encounter, and (3) the types of issues that demand the greatest effort to resolve. Our analysis draws on data from GitHub repositories and from leading FMware platforms, including HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, and Poe. Our findings reveal a strong focus on education, content creation, and business strategy, alongside persistent technical challenges in memory management, dependency handling, and tokenizer configuration. On GitHub, bug reports and core functionality issues are the most frequently reported problems, while code review, similarity search, and prompt template design are the most time-consuming to resolve. By uncovering developer practices and pain points, this study points to opportunities to improve FMware tools, workflows, and community support, and provides actionable insights to help guide the future of FMware development.</p></details> |  |

While substantial progress has been made in Java-based APR, largely facilitated by benchmarks like Defects4J, there remains a significant gap in research on C/C++ program repair, despite the widespread use of C/C++ and the prevalence of associated vulnerabilities. This gap is primarily due to the lack of high-quality, open-source benchmarks tailored for C/C++.

Unlike simple syntactic bugs, TIBs occur at the semantic level and are subtle - sometimes they remain undetected for years. Traditional detection methods, such as static analysis and dynamic testing, often struggle with TIBs due to their versatile and context-dependent nature. However, advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 present new opportunities for automating TIB detection by leveraging these models' semantic understanding capabilities. This paper reports the first systematic measurement of LLMs' capabilities in detecting TIBs, revealing that while GPT-4 shows promise, it exhibits limitations in precision and scalability. Specifically, its detection capability is undermined by the model's tendency to focus on the code snippets that do not contain TIBs; its scalability concern arises from GPT-4's high cost and the massive amount of code requiring inspection. To address these challenges, we introduce \name, a novel and cascaded TIB detection system. \name leverages smaller, code-specific, and highly efficient language models to filter out large numbers of code snippets unlikely to contain TIBs, thereby significantly enhancing the system's performance in terms of precision, recall, and scalability. We evaluated \name on 154 Python and C GitHub repositories, each with over 1,000 stars, uncovering 123 new flaws, 45\% of which could be exploited to disrupt program functionalities. Out of our 69 submitted fixes, 41 have already been confirmed or merged.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 Accepted, with Appendix added</p></details> |

Yet, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to be false alarms. To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software verifiers to catch real-world bugs.</p></details> | under submission |
| **[Can ChatGPT support software verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |
| **[Cottontail: Large Language Model-Driven Concolic Execution for Highly Structured Test Input Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17542v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we perform concolic execution to generate highly structured test inputs for systematically testing parsing programs? Existing concolic execution engines are significantly restricted by (1) input structure-agnostic path constraint selection, leading to the waste of testing effort or missing coverage; (2) limited constraint-solving capability, yielding many syntactically invalid test inputs; (3) reliance on manual acquisition of highly structured seed inputs, resulting in non-continuous testing. This paper proposes Cottontail, a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven concolic execution engine, to mitigate the above limitations. A more complete program path representation, named Expressive Structural Coverage Tree (ESCT), is first constructed to select structure-aware path constraints. Later, an LLM-driven constraint solver based on a Solve-Complete paradigm is designed to solve the path constraints smartly to get test inputs that are not only satisfiable to the constraints but also valid to the input syntax. Finally, a history-guided seed acquisition is employed to obtain new highly structured test inputs either before testing starts or after testing is saturated. We implemented Cottontail on top of SymCC and evaluated eight extensively tested open-source libraries across four different formats (XML, SQL, JavaScript, and JSON). Cottontail significantly outperforms baseline approaches by 30.73% and 41.32% on average in terms of line and branch coverage. Besides, Cottontail found six previously unknown vulnerabilities (six CVEs assigned). We have reported these issues to developers, and four out of them have been fixed so far.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the 2026 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (22 pages, with detailed Appendix)</p></details> |

In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions: creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting, contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop Submission at the sixth decennial Aarhus conference in Workshop "The End of Programming (as we know it) - Envisioning Radical Re-Conceptualizations of Co-Coding with AI"</p></details> |
| **[Formal Analysis of Metastable Failures in Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03551v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale software systems demonstrate metastable failures. In this class of failures, a stressor such as a temporary spike in workload causes the system performance to drop and, subsequently, the system performance continues to remain low even when the stressor is removed. These failures have been reported by many large corporations and considered to be a rare but catastrophic source of availability outages in cloud systems. In this paper, we provide the mathematical foundations of metastability in request-response server systems. We model such systems using a domain-specific language. We show how to construct continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) that approximate the semantics of the programs through modeling and data-driven calibration. We use the structure of the CTMC models to provide a visualization of the qualitative behavior of the model. The visualization is a surprisingly effective way to identify system parameterizations that cause a system to show metastable behaviors. We complement the qualitative analysis with quantitative predictions. We provide a formal notion of metastable behaviors based on escape probabilities, and show that metastable behaviors are related to the eigenvalue structure of the CTMC. Our characterization leads to algorithmic tools to predict recovery times in metastable models of server systems. We have implemented our technique in a tool for the modeling and analysis of server systems. Through models inspired by failures in real request-response systems, we show that our qualitative visual analysis captures and predicts many instances of metastability that were observed in the field in a matter of milliseconds. Our algorithms confirm that recovery times surge as the system parameters approach metastable modes in the dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[iCodeReviewer: Improving Secure Code Review with Mixture of Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12186v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is an essential process to ensure the quality of software that identifies potential software issues at an early stage of software development. Among all software issues, security issues are the most important to identify, as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions. Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the manual efforts required in the secure code review process. Despite the progress, current automated approaches on secure code review, including static analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automated secure code review approach based on large language models (LLMs). iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-prompts architecture that incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage of security issues. Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a specific security issue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of iCodeReviewer in security issue identification and localization with an F1 of 63.98%. The review comments generated by iCodeReviewer also achieve a high acceptance rate up to 84% when it is deployed in production environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Neural Code Representation with Additional Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12082v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program comprehension underpins many software engineering tasks, from code summarisation to clone detection. Recent deep learning models achieve strong results but typically rely on source code alone, overlooking contextual information such as version history or structural relationships. This limits their ability to capture how code evolves and operates. We conduct an empirical study on how enriching code representations with such contextual signals affects neural model performance on key comprehension tasks. Two downstream tasks, code clone detection and code summarisation, are evaluated using SeSaMe (1,679 Java methods) and CodeSearchNet (63,259 methods). Five representative models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, ASTNN) are fine-tuned under code-only and context-augmented settings. Results show that context generally improves performance: version history consistently boosts clone detection (e.g., CodeT5 +15.92% F1) and summarisation (e.g., GraphCodeBERT +5.56% METEOR), while call-graph effects vary by model and task. Combining multiple contexts yields further gains (up to +21.48% macro-F1). Human evaluation on 100 Java snippets confirms that context-augmented summaries are significantly preferred for Accuracy and Content Adequacy (p <= 0.026; |delta| up to 0.55). These findings highlight the potential of contextual signals to enhance code comprehension and open new directions for optimising contextual encoding in neural SE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+, primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold: First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Unfortunately, modern application codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.19\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 6.08\% (upto 20\%) performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization, without any execution.</p></details> |  |

| **[Automatically Generating Questions About Scratch Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11658v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When learning to program, students are usually assessed based on the code they wrote. However, the mere completion of a programming task does not guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model, and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913 projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to their overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CompEd 2025</p></details> |

We present \textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts, enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user workflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API, and a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of deployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \textit{CodeWatcher} enables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich behavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development. This infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI, developer productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs.

While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis reveals \textbf{a striking Matthew effect: the more popular a programming language or framework, the higher the success rate of LLM-generated code}. The phenomenon suggests that AI systems may reinforce existing popularity hierarchies, accelerating convergence around dominant tools while hindering diversity and innovation. We provide a quantitative characterization of this effect and discuss its implications for the future evolution of programming ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

To solve this, we propose a resource-optimized retrieval augmentation method, SaraCoder. It maximizes information diversity and representativeness in a limited context window, significantly boosting the accuracy and reliability of repository-level code completion. Its core Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis. Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks demonstrate that SaraCoder outperforms existing baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and resource-optimized repository-level code completion systems.</p></details> |  |

While substantial progress has been made in Java-based APR, largely facilitated by benchmarks like Defects4J, there remains a significant gap in research on C/C++ program repair, despite the widespread use of C/C++ and the prevalence of associated vulnerabilities. This gap is primarily due to the lack of high-quality, open-source benchmarks tailored for C/C++. To address this issue, we introduce Defects4C, a comprehensive and executable benchmark specifically designed for C/C++ program repair. Our dataset is constructed from real-world C/C++ repositories and includes a large collection of bug-relevant commits (9M in total), 248 high-quality buggy functions, and 102 vulnerable functions, all paired with test cases for reproduction. These resources enable rigorous evaluation of repair techniques and support the retraining of learning-based approaches for enhanced performance. Using Defects4C, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of 24 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in repairing C/C++ faults.

Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that remains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer Rust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written idiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle with project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project into smaller units (\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them bottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up, unit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a global perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with two types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record global behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to higher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership, mutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \kg{} with LLMs, we further propose \ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust translation technique. In \ourtool{}, the \kg{} provides LLMs with comprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs towards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our experiments show that \ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by 99.9\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based rewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\% higher functional correctness than those fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Output Format Biases in the Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17214v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation between programming languages (PLs) is a critical task in software engineering, facilitating the modernization of legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and enhancing software performance. Most existing studies instruct LLMs to perform code translation and evaluate their performance by either running the generated outputs through test suites or comparing them to reference outputs (ground truth). These outputs, however, may contain not only executable source code but also additional non-code elements, such as natural language explanations or formatting tokens. We refer to the combination of source code and non-code elements as the output format. It is crucial to understand and address variations in output format, as non-code elements can interfere with evaluation metrics, resulting in biased assessments of model performance and comparisons. We conduct an empirical analysis of the outputs from eleven instruct-tuned open-source LLMs, across five PLs: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. The results show that between 26.4% and 73.7% of outputs produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing. To mitigate output format bias, we propose a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expressions that effectively extracts source code from mixed-format outputs, enabling the eleven open-source models to achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%. Our empirical study confirms that output format bias affects widely used execution-based metrics, i.e., Computational Accuracy (CA), and text-based metrics, i.e., BLEU, CodeBLEU and CrystalBLEU. Additionally, we test five closed-source LLMs and observe that they also generate varying distributions of output formats, which could lead to output format biases. Our results highlight the need to mitigate the output format bias to enable reliable evaluations in LLMs for code translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version (v2) is a journal extension of our previous conference submission that was accepted into the 2024 IEEE/ACM First International Conference on AI Foundation Models and Software Engineering (Forge 2024), which includes new experiments and results</p></details> |

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Advances in large language models (LLMs) are enabling new development styles - from chat-oriented programming and 'vibe coding' to agentic programming - that can accelerate productivity and broaden access. This paper examines how AI-assisted techniques are changing software engineering practice, and the related issues of trust, accountability, and shifting skills. We survey iterative chat-based development, multi-agent systems, dynamic prompt orchestration, and integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Using case studies and industry data, we outline both the opportunities (faster cycles, democratized coding) and the challenges (model reliability and cost) of applying generative AI to coding. We describe new roles, skills, and best practices for using AI in a responsible and effective way.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; 1 figure; preprint; v</p></details> |
| **[LineBreaker: Finding Token-Inconsistency Bugs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01668v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token-inconsistency bugs (TIBs) involve the misuse of syntactically valid yet incorrect code tokens, such as misused variables and erroneous function invocations, which can often lead to software bugs. Unlike simple syntactic bugs, TIBs occur at the semantic level and are subtle - sometimes they remain undetected for years. Traditional detection methods, such as static analysis and dynamic testing, often struggle with TIBs due to their versatile and context-dependent nature. However, advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 present new opportunities for automating TIB detection by leveraging these models' semantic understanding capabilities. This paper reports the first systematic measurement of LLMs' capabilities in detecting TIBs, revealing that while GPT-4 shows promise, it exhibits limitations in precision and scalability. Specifically, its detection capability is undermined by the model's tendency to focus on the code snippets that do not contain TIBs; its scalability concern arises from GPT-4's high cost and the massive amount of code requiring inspection. To address these challenges, we introduce \name, a novel and cascaded TIB detection system. \name leverages smaller, code-specific, and highly efficient language models to filter out large numbers of code snippets unlikely to contain TIBs, thereby significantly enhancing the system's performance in terms of precision, recall, and scalability. We evaluated \name on 154 Python and C GitHub repositories, each with over 1,000 stars, uncovering 123 new flaws, 45\% of which could be exploited to disrupt program functionalities. Out of our 69 submitted fixes, 41 have already been confirmed or merged.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 Accepted, with Appendix added</p></details> |

Recent approaches employ code-LLMs with slow-fast code pairs provided as optimization guidance, but such pair-based methods obscure the causal factors of performance gains and often lead to superficial pattern imitation rather than genuine performance reasoning. We introduce ECO, a performance-aware prompting framework for code optimization. ECO first distills runtime optimization instructions (ROIs) from reference slow-fast code pairs; Each ROI describes root causes of inefficiency and the rationales that drive performance improvements. For a given input code, ECO in parallel employs (i) a symbolic advisor to produce a bottleneck diagnosis tailored to the code, and (ii) an ROI retriever to return related ROIs. These two outputs are then composed into a performance-aware prompt, providing actionable guidance for code-LLMs. ECO's prompts are model-agnostic, require no fine-tuning, and can be easily prepended to any code-LLM prompt. Our empirical studies highlight that ECO prompting significantly improves code-LLMs' ability to generate efficient code, achieving speedups of up to 7.81x while minimizing correctness loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-Incorporating Code Structural Knowledge into Pretrained Models via ICL for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22776v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation migrates codebases across programming languages. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in software mining. However, handling the syntactic structure of source code remains a challenge. Classic syntax-aware methods depend on intricate model architectures and loss functions, rendering their integration into LLM training resource-intensive. This paper employs in-context learning (ICL), which directly integrates task exemplars into the input context, to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into pre-trained LLMs. We revisit exemplar selection in ICL from an information-theoretic perspective, proposing that list-wise selection based on information coverage is more precise and general objective than traditional methods based on combining similarity and diversity. To address the challenges of quantifying information coverage, we introduce a surrogate measure, Coverage of Abstract Syntax Tree (CAST). Furthermore, we formulate the NP-hard CAST maximization for exemplar selection and prove that it is a standard submodular maximization problem. Therefore, we propose a greedy algorithm for CAST submodular maximization, which theoretically guarantees a (1-1/e)-approximate solution in polynomial time complexity. Our method is the first training-free and model-agnostic approach to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into existing LLMs at test time. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves LLMs performance and reveals two meaningful insights: 1) Code structural knowledge can be effectively post-incorporated into pre-trained LLMs during inference, despite being overlooked during training; 2) Scaling up model size or training data does not lead to the emergence of code structural knowledge, underscoring the necessity of explicitly considering code syntactic structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Testing and Enhancing Multi-Agent Systems for Robust Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10460v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks by decomposing complex coding tasks across specialized agents with different roles. Despite their prosperous development and adoption, their robustness remains pressingly under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world deployment. This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the robustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing approach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness flaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they initially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving mutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet largely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between planning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding agents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a multi-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a repairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new monitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for developing more reliable MASs for code generation.</p></details> | 19pages, 5 figures |

Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines these graph representations with light-weight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over Graph Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable, explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights, facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, 14 equations, accepted at the 14th International Conference on Complex Networks and Their Applications (COMPLEX NETWORKS 2025) and the conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Studies in Computational Intelligence series</p></details> |

Academic research, industrial projects (e.g., Amazon Braket, IBM Qiskit), and consortiums like 'Quantum Flagship' are striving to develop practically capable and commercially viable quantum computing (QC) systems and technologies. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is viewed as a solution attuned to the philosophy of service-orientation that can offer QC resources and platforms, as utility computing, to individuals and organisations who do not own quantum computers. This research investigates a process-centric and architecture-driven approach to offer a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS - a.k.a quantum service-orientation. We employed a two-phase research method comprising (a) a systematic mapping study and (b) an architecture-based development, first to identify the phases of the quantum service development life cycle and subsequently to integrate these phases into a reference architecture that supports QCaaS. The SMS process retrieved a collection of potentially relevant research literature and based on a multi-step selection and qualitative assessment, we selected 41 peer-reviewed studies to answer three RQs. The RQs investigate (i) demographic details in terms of frequency, types, and trends of research, (ii) phases of quantum service development lifecycle to derive a reference architecture for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of services, and (iii) The results identify a 4-phased development lifecycle along with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations, catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can be integrated in a layered reference architecture to engineer QCaaS.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 images, 5 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[AP2O: Correcting LLM-Generated Code Errors Type by Type Like Humans via Adaptive Progressive Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02393v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs' code generation capabilities have yielded substantial improvements in the effectiveness of programming tasks. However, LLM-generated code still suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from 0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in pass@k while using less preference data.

| **[Learning to Guarantee Type Correctness in Code Generation through Type-Guided Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10216v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation; nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs are All You Need? Improving Fuzz Testing for MOJO with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10179v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing, which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity. Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches. Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mathematics-Guided Approach to Floating-Point Error Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10081v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Floating-point program errors can lead to severe consequences, particularly in critical domains such as military applications. Only a small subset of inputs may induce substantial floating-point errors, prompting researchers to develop methods for identifying these error-inducing inputs. Although existing approaches have achieved some success, they still suffer from two major limitations: (1) High computational cost: The evaluation of error magnitude for candidate inputs relies on high-precision programs, which are prohibitively time-consuming. (2) Limited long-range convergence capability: Current methods exhibit inefficiency in search, making the process akin to finding a needle in a haystack. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel method, named MGDE, to detect error-inducing inputs based on mathematical guidance. By employing the Newton-Raphson method, which exhibits quadratic convergence properties, we achieve highly effective and efficient results. Since the goal of identifying error-inducing inputs is to uncover the underlying bugs, we use the number of bugs detected in floating-point programs as the primary evaluation metric in our experiments. As FPCC represents the most effective state-of-the-art approach to date, we use it as the baseline for comparison. The dataset of FPCC consists of 88 single-input floating-point programs. FPCC is able to detect 48 bugs across 29 programs, whereas our method successfully identifies 89 bugs across 44 programs. Moreover, FPCC takes 6.4096 times as long as our proposed method. We also deploy our method to multi-input programs, identifying a total of nine bugs with an average detection time of 0.6443 seconds per program. In contrast, FPCC fails to detect any bugs while requiring an average computation time of 100 seconds per program.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluations typically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of whether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect transformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and erode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this gap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript obfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to generate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language constructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable programs and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides LLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic extraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more focused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain knowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown correctness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE, Fuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary focus on obfuscation induced misbehavior. An ablation shows that all components except our generic MRs contribute to at least one bug class; the negative MR result suggests the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations. Our results also seed discussion on how to balance obfuscation presets and performance cost. We envision OBsmith as an important step towards automated testing and quality assurance of obfuscators and other semantic-preserving toolchains.</p></details> |  |
| **[OFP-Repair: Repairing Floating-point Errors via Original-Precision Arithmetic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09938v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Errors in floating-point programs can lead to severe consequences, particularly in critical domains such as military, aerospace, and financial systems, making their repair a crucial research problem. In practice, some errors can be fixed using original-precision arithmetic, while others require high-precision computation. Developers often avoid addressing the latter due to excessive computational resources required. However, they sometimes struggle to distinguish between these two types of errors, and existing repair tools fail to assist in this differentiation. Most current repair tools rely on high-precision implementations, which are time-consuming to develop and demand specialized expertise. Although a few tools do not require high-precision programs, they can only fix a limited subset of errors or produce suboptimal results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named OFP-Repair.On ACESO's dataset, our patches achieve improvements of three, seven, three, and eight orders of magnitude across four accuracy metrics. In real-world cases, our method successfully detects all five original-precision-repairable errors and fixes three, whereas ACESO only repairs one. Notably, these results are based on verified data and do not fully capture the potential of OFP-Repair. To further validate our method, we deploy it on a decade-old open bug report from GNU Scientific Library (GSL), successfully repairing five out of 15 bugs. The developers have expressed interest in our method and are considering integrating our tool into their development workflow. We are currently working on applying our patches to GSL. The results are highly encouraging, demonstrating the practical applicability of our technique.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches to optimization rely on manual tuning and compiler heuristics, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse codebases. Recent methods using LLMs introduce automation, but they do not scale effectively to the complexity and size of real-world software systems, leaving a gap in practical applicability. We present SysLLMatic, a system that integrates LLMs with performance diagnostics feedback and a curated catalog of 43 optimization patterns to automatically optimize software code. Our approach builds on recent advances in LLM-based code optimization and specifically targets the limitations of existing systems in handling real-world software applications. We evaluate it on three benchmark suites: HumanEval_CPP (competitive programming in C++), SciMark2 (scientific kernels in Java), and DaCapoBench (large-scale software systems in Java). Results show that SysLLMatic can improve software system performance, including latency, throughput, energy efficiency, memory usage, and CPU utilization. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM baselines on microbenchmarks. On large-scale application codes, to which prior LLM approaches have not scaled, it surpasses compiler optimizations, achieving average relative improvements of 1.5x in latency (vs. 1.01x for the compiler) and 1.76x in throughput (vs. 1.02x for the compiler). Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, guided by principled system thinking through the optimization pattern catalog and appropriate performance diagnostics, can serve as viable software system optimizers. We further identify limitations of our approach and the challenges involved in handling complex applications. This work provides a foundation for generating optimized code across various languages, benchmarks, and program sizes in a principled manner.</p></details> |  |

Monitoring these large-scale systems, which relies on efficient state estimation, represents a challenging computational task and requires efficient simulation tools for power system steady-state analyses. Motivated by this observation, we propose JuliaGrid, an open-source framework written in the Julia programming language, designed for high performance execution across multiple platforms. The framework implements observability analysis, weighted least-squares and least-absolute value estimators, bad data analysis, and various algorithms related to phasor measurements. To complete power system analysis, the framework includes power flow and optimal power flow, enabling measurement generation for the state estimation routines. Leveraging computationally efficient algorithms, JuliaGrid solves large-scale systems across all methods, offering competitive performance compared to other open-source tools. It is specifically designed for quasi-steady-state analysis, with automatic detection and reuse of computed data to boost performance. These capabilities are validated on systems with 10000, 20000 and 70000 buses.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20854v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Numerous synthesizers have been developed to tackle program synthesis, manifesting different ideas to approach the exponentially growing program space. While numerous smart program synthesis tools exist, reusing and remixing previously developed methods is tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in the Julia programming language, to address these issues. Since current methods rely on similar building blocks, we aim to modularize the underlying synthesis algorithm into communicating and fully extendable sub-compartments, allowing for straightforward reapplication of these modules. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show three common use cases: 1. how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it, 2. how to implement a previously developed synthesizer with just a few lines of code, and 3. how to run a synthesizer against a benchmark.</p></details> |  |

This paper reports on the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated, concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs (which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX, our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC compiler.</p></details> | <details><summary>examp...</summary><p>examples at https://lair.masot.net/trex .

Despite this transformation, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering, bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting 50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria. Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered software engineering systems.</p></details> | 21 pages |

However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoC2Rust: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.</p></details> |  |

These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone, as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces (API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration. Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2504.13272</p></details> |

Yet, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to be false alarms. To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software verifiers to catch real-world bugs.</p></details> | under submission |
| **[On the Robustness Evaluation of 3D Obstacle Detection Against Specifications in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13653v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) rely on real-time sensor data, such as cameras and LiDARs, for time-critical decisions using deep neural networks. The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

Prior literature focused on how data protection regulations are discussed for software in operation, or how this topic is discussed in various channels outside of the software development process. Yet, what is missing, is a perspective on the impact of such regulations on the software development process. In our work, we address this gap, and explore how discussions during the development of software are impacted by regulations, who reports and discusses issues related to personal data and data protection, and how developers react to those issues. To that end, we used inductive coding to analyze 652 issues from Open Source GitHub projects and used the codes to quantitatively analyze the relation between the roles, resolutions, and data protection issues to understand correlations and predict resolutions of issues. Most notably we observed a significant increase in reporting when GDPR came into effect. The most common issue types were feature requests for privacy enhancement, which were mainly reported and discussed by frequent reporters and frequent committers. But especially issues regarding privacy enhancement were also frequently reported by one-time reporters. Most of the requests were solved without opposing votes. All in all, our findings indicate that data protection regulations effectively start discussions about privacy within the software development community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |

Despite growing interest, the literature lacks a cohesive synthesis of runtime composition in dynamic SoSs. Objective: This study synthesizes research on runtime composition in dynamic SoSs and identifies core challenges, solution strategies, supporting tools, and evaluation methods. Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and selecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges fall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system orchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs. Solutions span seven areas: co-simulation and digital twins, semantic ontologies, integration frameworks, adaptive architectures, middleware, formal methods, and AI-driven resilience. Service-oriented frameworks for composition and integration dominate tooling, while simulation platforms support evaluation. Interoperability across tools, limited cross-toolchain workflows, and the absence of standardized benchmarks remain key gaps. Evaluation approaches include simulation-based, implementation-driven, and human-centered studies, which have been applied in domains such as smart cities, healthcare, defense, and industrial automation. Conclusions: The synthesis reveals tensions, including autonomy versus coordination, the modeling-reality gap, and socio-technical integration. It calls for standardized evaluation metrics, scalable decentralized architectures, and cross-domain frameworks. The analysis aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing dynamically composable SoSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can ChatGPT support software verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |
| **[Cottontail: Large Language Model-Driven Concolic Execution for Highly Structured Test Input Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17542v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we perform concolic execution to generate highly structured test inputs for systematically testing parsing programs? Existing concolic execution engines are significantly restricted by (1) input structure-agnostic path constraint selection, leading to the waste of testing effort or missing coverage; (2) limited constraint-solving capability, yielding many syntactically invalid test inputs; (3) reliance on manual acquisition of highly structured seed inputs, resulting in non-continuous testing. This paper proposes Cottontail, a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven concolic execution engine, to mitigate the above limitations. A more complete program path representation, named Expressive Structural Coverage Tree (ESCT), is first constructed to select structure-aware path constraints. Later, an LLM-driven constraint solver based on a Solve-Complete paradigm is designed to solve the path constraints smartly to get test inputs that are not only satisfiable to the constraints but also valid to the input syntax. Finally, a history-guided seed acquisition is employed to obtain new highly structured test inputs either before testing starts or after testing is saturated. We implemented Cottontail on top of SymCC and evaluated eight extensively tested open-source libraries across four different formats (XML, SQL, JavaScript, and JSON). Cottontail significantly outperforms baseline approaches by 30.73% and 41.32% on average in terms of line and branch coverage. Besides, Cottontail found six previously unknown vulnerabilities (six CVEs assigned). We have reported these issues to developers, and four out of them have been fixed so far.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the 2026 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (22 pages, with detailed Appendix)</p></details> |

Although these models are widely adopted, their accuracy and precision remain underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study evaluating how well such models reflect actual energy consumption during realistic user interactions with common website categories. Energy use was measured across shopping, booking, navigation, and news services using predefined user flows executed on four laptop platforms. The results show that the commonly applied constant-power approximation (P * t) can diverge substantially from measured energy, depending on website category, device type, and task characteristics. The findings demonstrate that model deviations are systematic rather than random and highlight the need for category-aware and device-reflective power parameters in reproducible sustainability reporting frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The EmpathiSEr: Development and Validation of Software Engineering Oriented Empathy Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12546v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empathy plays a critical role in software engineering (SE), influencing collaboration, communication, and user-centred design. Although SE research has increasingly recognised empathy as a key human aspect, there remains no validated instrument specifically designed to measure it within the unique socio-technical contexts of SE. Existing generic empathy scales, while well-established in psychology and healthcare, often rely on language, scenarios, and assumptions that are not meaningful or interpretable for software practitioners. These scales fail to account for the diverse, role-specific, and domain-bound expressions of empathy in SE, such as understanding a non-technical user's frustrations or another practitioner's technical constraints, which differ substantially from empathy in clinical or everyday contexts. To address this gap, we developed and validated two domain-specific empathy scales: EmpathiSEr-P, assessing empathy among practitioners, and EmpathiSEr-U, capturing practitioner empathy towards users. Grounded in a practitioner-informed conceptual framework, the scales encompass three dimensions of empathy: cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and empathic responses. We followed a rigorous, multi-phase methodology, including expert evaluation, cognitive interviews, and two practitioner surveys. The resulting instruments represent the first psychometrically validated empathy scales tailored to SE, offering researchers and practitioners a tool for assessing empathy and designing empathy-enhancing interventions in software teams and user interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MooseAgent: A LLM Based Multi-agent Framework for Automating Moose Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08621v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific computing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing stages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 Figs |
| **[A Cooperative Approach for Knowledge-based Business Process Design in a Public Authority](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19842v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprises are currently undergoing profound transformations due to the unpostponable digital transformation. Then, to remain competitive, enterprises must adapt digital solutions, transforming their organisational structures and operations. This organisational shift is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises. A key innovation frontier is the adoption of process-oriented production models. This paper presents a knowledge-based method to support business experts in designing business processes. The method requires no prior expertise in Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations. The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders and actors who participate in the BP design.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code $+$ diff $\rightarrow$ new code), anti-apply (new code $-$ diff $\rightarrow$ old code), and diff generation (new code $-$ old code $\rightarrow$ diff). Instances in the benchmark are triples $\langle \textit{old code}, \textit{new code}, \textit{diff} \rangle$ drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For example, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models in the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and smaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/diff-xyz.</p></details> |  |

This feature promises to facilitate the creation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and interfacing with existing system descriptions and technical designs. In this paper, we review these features and evaluate SysMLv2's capabilities using concrete use cases. We develop DarTwin DSL, a DSL that formalizes the existing DarTwin notation for Digital Twin (DT) evolution, through SysMLv2, thereby supposedly enabling the wide application of DarTwin's evolution templates using any SysMLv2 tool. We demonstrate DarTwin DSL, but also point out limitations in the currently available tooling of SysMLv2 in terms of graphical notation capabilities. This work contributes to the growing field of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) for DTs and combines it with the release of SysMLv2, thus integrating a systematic approach with DT evolution management in systems engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, their results are often treated with caution, as the presumed high variability of performance in the cloud raises concerns about reproducibility and credibility. In a recent study, we empirically quantified the impact of this variability on benchmarking results by repeatedly executing a stream processing application benchmark at different times of the day over several months. Our analysis confirms that performance variability is indeed observable at the application level, although it is less pronounced than often assumed. The larger scale of our study compared to related work allowed us to identify subtle daily and weekly performance patterns. We now extend this investigation by examining whether a major global event, such as Black Friday, affects the outcomes of performance benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 16th Symposium on Software Performance 2025</p></details> |

While encoders can be configured to produce bitstreams that are decoder-friendly, estimating the decoding complexity and energy overhead for a given video is non-trivial. In this study, we systematically analyse the impact of disabling various coding tools and adjusting coding parameters in two AV1 encoders, libaom-av1 and SVT-AV1. Using system-level energy measurement tools like RAPL (Running Average Power Limit), Intel SoC Watch (integrated with VTune profiler), we quantify the resulting trade-offs between decoding complexity, energy consumption, and compression efficiency for decoding a bitstream. Our results demonstrate that specific encoder configurations can substantially reduce decoding complexity with minimal perceptual quality degradation. For libaom-av1, disabling CDEF, an in-loop filter gives us a mean reduction in decoding cycles by 10%. For SVT-AV1, using the in-built, fast-decode=2 preset achieves a more substantial 24% reduction in decoding cycles. These findings provide strategies for content providers to lower the energy footprint of AV1 video streaming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Camera-Ready paper for PCS 2025, 5 Pages</p></details> |

In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions: creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting, contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop Submission at the sixth decennial Aarhus conference in Workshop "The End of Programming (as we know it) - Envisioning Radical Re-Conceptualizations of Co-Coding with AI"</p></details> |

Identifying the technical, organizational and social factors that lead to differences in engagement is required to remove barriers and utilize enablers for testing. While much research emphasizes the usefulness of testing strategies and technical solutions, less is known about why developers do (not) test. This study investigates the lived experience of software developers to illuminate how their opinions about testing change. Learning about personal evolutions of practice, we explore when and why testing is used. Employing socio-technical grounded theory (STGT), we construct a theory by systematically analyzing data from 19 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with software developers. Allowing interviewees to reflect on how and why they approach software testing, we explore perspectives that are rooted in their contextual experiences. We develop eleven categories of circumstances that act as conditions for the application and adaptation of testing practices and introduce three concepts that we then use to present our theory of emerging testing strategies (ETS) that explains why developers do (not) use testing practices. This study reveals a new perspective on the connection between testing artifacts and collective reflection of practitioners, and it embraces testing as an experience in which human- and social aspects are entangled with organizational and technical circumstances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print, submitted to EMSE Journal (Springer), First Revision</p></details> |

A Scoping Review on Verbalization in Software Engineering with LLM-Assisted Screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12294v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how software developers think, make decisions, and behave remains a key challenge in software engineering (SE). Verbalization techniques (methods that capture spoken or written thought processes) offer a lightweight and accessible way to study these cognitive aspects. This paper presents a scoping review of research at the intersection of SE and psychology (PSY), focusing on the use of verbal data. To make large-scale interdisciplinary reviews feasible, we employed a large language model (LLM)-assisted screening pipeline using GPT to assess the relevance of over 9,000 papers based solely on titles. We addressed two questions: what themes emerge from verbalization-related work in SE, and how effective are LLMs in supporting interdisciplinary review processes? We validated GPT's outputs against human reviewers and found high consistency, with a 13\% disagreement rate. Prominent themes mainly were tied to the craft of SE, while more human-centered topics were underrepresented. The data also suggests that SE frequently draws on PSY methods, whereas the reverse is rare.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint of a paper under publication in Quality of Information and Communications Technology 2025</p></details> |

By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of Abmax.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Formal Analysis of Metastable Failures in Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03551v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale software systems demonstrate metastable failures. In this class of failures, a stressor such as a temporary spike in workload causes the system performance to drop and, subsequently, the system performance continues to remain low even when the stressor is removed. These failures have been reported by many large corporations and considered to be a rare but catastrophic source of availability outages in cloud systems. In this paper, we provide the mathematical foundations of metastability in request-response server systems. We model such systems using a domain-specific language. We show how to construct continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) that approximate the semantics of the programs through modeling and data-driven calibration. We use the structure of the CTMC models to provide a visualization of the qualitative behavior of the model. The visualization is a surprisingly effective way to identify system parameterizations that cause a system to show metastable behaviors. We complement the qualitative analysis with quantitative predictions. We provide a formal notion of metastable behaviors based on escape probabilities, and show that metastable behaviors are related to the eigenvalue structure of the CTMC. Our characterization leads to algorithmic tools to predict recovery times in metastable models of server systems. We have implemented our technique in a tool for the modeling and analysis of server systems. Through models inspired by failures in real request-response systems, we show that our qualitative visual analysis captures and predicts many instances of metastability that were observed in the field in a matter of milliseconds. Our algorithms confirm that recovery times surge as the system parameters approach metastable modes in the dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[iCodeReviewer: Improving Secure Code Review with Mixture of Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12186v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is an essential process to ensure the quality of software that identifies potential software issues at an early stage of software development. Among all software issues, security issues are the most important to identify, as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions. Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the manual efforts required in the secure code review process. Despite the progress, current automated approaches on secure code review, including static analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automated secure code review approach based on large language models (LLMs). iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-prompts architecture that incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage of security issues. Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a specific security issue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of iCodeReviewer in security issue identification and localization with an F1 of 63.98%. The review comments generated by iCodeReviewer also achieve a high acceptance rate up to 84% when it is deployed in production environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Engineering Multi-Agent LLMs: A Protocol-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12120v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for software development has driven interest in automating software engineering (SE) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with verification, and is implemented atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6% reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Neural Code Representation with Additional Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12082v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program comprehension underpins many software engineering tasks, from code summarisation to clone detection. Recent deep learning models achieve strong results but typically rely on source code alone, overlooking contextual information such as version history or structural relationships. This limits their ability to capture how code evolves and operates. We conduct an empirical study on how enriching code representations with such contextual signals affects neural model performance on key comprehension tasks. Two downstream tasks, code clone detection and code summarisation, are evaluated using SeSaMe (1,679 Java methods) and CodeSearchNet (63,259 methods). Five representative models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, ASTNN) are fine-tuned under code-only and context-augmented settings. Results show that context generally improves performance: version history consistently boosts clone detection (e.g., CodeT5 +15.92% F1) and summarisation (e.g., GraphCodeBERT +5.56% METEOR), while call-graph effects vary by model and task. Combining multiple contexts yields further gains (up to +21.48% macro-F1). Human evaluation on 100 Java snippets confirms that context-augmented summaries are significantly preferred for Accuracy and Content Adequacy (p <= 0.026; |delta| up to 0.55). These findings highlight the potential of contextual signals to enhance code comprehension and open new directions for optimising contextual encoding in neural SE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative AI for Requirements Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06741v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introduction: Requirements engineering faces challenges due to the handling of increasingly complex software systems. These challenges can be addressed using generative AI. Given that GenAI based RE has not been systematically analyzed in detail, this review examines related research, focusing on trends, methodologies, challenges, and future directions. Methods: A systematic methodology for paper selection, data extraction, and feature analysis is used to comprehensively review 238 articles published from 2019 to 2025 and available from major academic databases. Results: Generative pretrained transformer models dominate current applications (67.3%), but research remains unevenly distributed across RE phases, with analysis (30.0%) and elicitation (22.1%) receiving the most attention, and management (6.8%) underexplored. Three core challenges: reproducibility (66.8%), hallucinations (63.4%), and interpretability (57.1%) form a tightly interlinked triad affecting trust and consistency. Strong correlations (35% cooccurrence) indicate these challenges must be addressed holistically. Industrial adoption remains nascent, with over 90% of studies corresponding to early stage development and only 1.3% reaching production level integration. Conclusions: Evaluation practices show maturity gaps, limited tool and dataset availability, and fragmented benchmarking approaches. Despite the transformative potential of GenAI based RE, several barriers hinder practical adoption. The strong correlations among core challenges demand specialized architectures targeting interdependencies rather than isolated solutions. The limited deployment reflects systemic bottlenecks in generalizability, data quality, and scalable evaluation methods. Successful adoption requires coordinated development across technical robustness, methodological maturity, and governance integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+, primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold: First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, these simulations typically require high-performance computing resources with numerous CPU cores, which are often inaccessible to many research groups and clinicians. To address this, we present TorchCor, a high-performance Python library for CEP simulations using the finite element method on general-purpose GPUs. Built on PyTorch, TorchCor significantly accelerates CEP simulations, particularly for large 3D meshes. The accuracy of the solver is verified against manufactured analytical solutions and the $N$-version benchmark problem.

| **[Phaedrus: Predicting Dynamic Application Behavior with Lightweight Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06994v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application profiling is an indispensable technique for many software development tasks, such as code and memory layout optimizations, where optimization decisions are tailored to specific program profiles. Unfortunately, modern application codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.19\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 6.08\% (upto 20\%) performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization, without any execution.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |

Existing agent-based methods have two key limitations. First, they lack of procedural knowledge (i.e., how an issue is fixed step-by-step and rationales behind it) to learn and leverage for issue resolution. Second, they rely on massive computational power to blindly explore the solution space. % To address those limitations, we propose Lingxi, an issue resolution framework that leverages procedural knowledge extracted from historical issue-fixing data to guide agents in solving repository-level issues. \ourTool first constructs this knowledge offline through a hierarchical abstraction mechanism, enabling agents to learn the how and why behind a fix, not just the final solution. During online application, it employs a knowledge-driven scaling method that leverages the procedural knowledge of similar issues to intelligently analyze the target issue from multiple perspectives, in sharp contrast to undirected, brute-force exploration. % Lingxi successfully resolves 74.6\% of bugs on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark in Past@1 setting, outperforming five state-of-the-art techniques by a significant margin (5.4\% to 14.9\%). Our comprehensive ablation study confirmed that the success of Lingxi comes directly from its use of procedural knowledge. Without it, the performance gains from scaling alone is negligible. Our qualitative study further shows that the ``design patterns $\&$ coding practices'' is the most critical knowledge aspect, and that the roles of different knowledge aspects switch across different stages (i.e., analysis, planning, and fixing).</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Aware Reduction for Scalable LLM-Database Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11813v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable LLM--data integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, the mere completion of a programming task does not guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model, and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913 projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to their overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CompEd 2025</p></details> |

We present \textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts, enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user workflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API, and a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of deployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \textit{CodeWatcher} enables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich behavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development. This infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI, developer productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs.

While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis reveals \textbf{a striking Matthew effect: the more popular a programming language or framework, the higher the success rate of LLM-generated code}. The phenomenon suggests that AI systems may reinforce existing popularity hierarchies, accelerating convergence around dominant tools while hindering diversity and innovation. We provide a quantitative characterization of this effect and discuss its implications for the future evolution of programming ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

By adding the upload of the measurements to the Nyrki\"o change detection service, we made it possible to detect performance changes.

An Empirical Study of Developer Challenges and Resolution Times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11138v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs), such as OpenAI's GPT, are fundamentally transforming the practice of software engineering by enabling the development of \emph{FMware} -- applications and infrastructures built around these models. FMware systems now support tasks such as code generation, natural-language interaction, knowledge integration, and multi-modal content creation, underscoring their disruptive impact on current software engineering workflows. However, the design, implementation, and evolution of FMware present significant new challenges, particularly across cloud-based and on-premise platforms where goals, processes, and tools often diverge from those of traditional software development. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of FMware development across both cloud-based platforms and open-source repositories. We empirically investigate the FMware ecosystem through three focus areas: (1) the most common application domains of FMware, (2) the key challenges developers encounter, and (3) the types of issues that demand the greatest effort to resolve. Our analysis draws on data from GitHub repositories and from leading FMware platforms, including HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, and Poe. Our findings reveal a strong focus on education, content creation, and business strategy, alongside persistent technical challenges in memory management, dependency handling, and tokenizer configuration. On GitHub, bug reports and core functionality issues are the most frequently reported problems, while code review, similarity search, and prompt template design are the most time-consuming to resolve. By uncovering developer practices and pain points, this study points to opportunities to improve FMware tools, workflows, and community support, and provides actionable insights to help guide the future of FMware development.</p></details> |  |
| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

To solve this, we propose a resource-optimized retrieval augmentation method, SaraCoder. It maximizes information diversity and representativeness in a limited context window, significantly boosting the accuracy and reliability of repository-level code completion. Its core Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis. Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks demonstrate that SaraCoder outperforms existing baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and resource-optimized repository-level code completion systems.</p></details> |  |

While substantial progress has been made in Java-based APR, largely facilitated by benchmarks like Defects4J, there remains a significant gap in research on C/C++ program repair, despite the widespread use of C/C++ and the prevalence of associated vulnerabilities. This gap is primarily due to the lack of high-quality, open-source benchmarks tailored for C/C++. To address this issue, we introduce Defects4C, a comprehensive and executable benchmark specifically designed for C/C++ program repair. Our dataset is constructed from real-world C/C++ repositories and includes a large collection of bug-relevant commits (9M in total), 248 high-quality buggy functions, and 102 vulnerable functions, all paired with test cases for reproduction. These resources enable rigorous evaluation of repair techniques and support the retraining of learning-based approaches for enhanced performance. Using Defects4C, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of 24 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in repairing C/C++ faults.

Existing repository summarization techniques primarily focus on summarizing code according to the directory tree, which is insufficient for tracing high-level features to the methods that collaboratively implement them. To address these limitations, we propose RepoSummary, a feature-oriented code repository summarization approach that simultaneously generates repository documentation automatically. Furthermore, it establishes more accurate traceability links from functional features to the corresponding code elements, enabling developers to rapidly locate relevant methods and files during code comprehension and maintenance. Comprehensive experiments against the state-of-the-art baseline (HGEN) demonstrate that RepoSummary achieves higher feature coverage and more accurate traceability. On average, it increases the rate of completely covered features in manual documentation from 61.2% to 71.1%, improves file-level traceability recall from 29.9% to 53.0%, and generates documentation that is more conceptually consistent, easier to understand, and better formatted than that produced by existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Developer Instructions and Code Completion Through Instruction-Aware Fill-in-the-Middle Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24637v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code completion, yet they often fail when the developer's intent is underspecified in the code context. To address this, developers usually add natural language instructions (e.g., comments) into the code context to clarify their intent. However, existing code LLMs applied for code completion systems merely undergo a fill-in-the-middle (FIM) pre-training, which struggles to leverage this information effectively due to the lack of instruction-like training data. Existing instruction-tuning techniques, improving instruction-following in general code generation, paradoxically degrades FIM performance, forcing a trade-off between instruction-following and infilling capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce Instruction-aware Fill-in-the-Middle (IFIM), an instruction-tuning method specifically designed to enhance FIM code completion models. IFIM extends the conventional FIM training objective by incorporating an explicit instruction section into the input, enabling the model to learn from (prefix, instruction, suffix) triplets. This approach allows the model to effectively leverage developer-provided directives while preserving its core completion abilities when no instructions are present. To facilitate this, we constructed a large-scale dataset by using GPT-4o to generate concise, intent-focused instructions for code infilling examples. We evaluated IFIM by applying it to two popular base models, Deepseek-Coder and Qwen2.5-Coder, on the benchmarks derived from HumanEval-infilling and RepoMasterEval. The results demonstrate that IFIM significantly improves instruction-following capabilities, boosting the Pass@1 score from 84.6% to 93.6%. Moreover, this enhancement does not compromise the models' original performance on FIM code completion tasks with no instructions provided.</p></details> |  |

Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that remains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer Rust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written idiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle with project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project into smaller units (\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them bottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up, unit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a global perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with two types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record global behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to higher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership, mutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \kg{} with LLMs, we further propose \ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust translation technique. In \ourtool{}, the \kg{} provides LLMs with comprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs towards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our experiments show that \ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by 99.9\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based rewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\% higher functional correctness than those fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.</p></details> |  |

To understand the state of affairs, we performed a grey literature review using 47 publicly available practitioner sources including blogs, articles, and industry reports. We found that software project managers primarily perceive GenAI as an "assistant", "copilot", or "friend" rather than as a "PM replacement", with support of GenAI in automating routine tasks, predictive analytics, communication and collaboration, and in agile practices leading to project success. Practitioners emphasize responsible GenAI usage given concerns such as hallucinations, ethics and privacy, and lack of emotional intelligence and human judgment. We present upskilling requirements for software project managers in the GenAI era mapped to the Project Management Institute's talent triangle. We share key recommendations for both practitioners and researchers.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies instruct LLMs to perform code translation and evaluate their performance by either running the generated outputs through test suites or comparing them to reference outputs (ground truth). These outputs, however, may contain not only executable source code but also additional non-code elements, such as natural language explanations or formatting tokens. We refer to the combination of source code and non-code elements as the output format. It is crucial to understand and address variations in output format, as non-code elements can interfere with evaluation metrics, resulting in biased assessments of model performance and comparisons. We conduct an empirical analysis of the outputs from eleven instruct-tuned open-source LLMs, across five PLs: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. The results show that between 26.4% and 73.7% of outputs produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing. To mitigate output format bias, we propose a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expressions that effectively extracts source code from mixed-format outputs, enabling the eleven open-source models to achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%. Our empirical study confirms that output format bias affects widely used execution-based metrics, i.e., Computational Accuracy (CA), and text-based metrics, i.e., BLEU, CodeBLEU and CrystalBLEU. Additionally, we test five closed-source LLMs and observe that they also generate varying distributions of output formats, which could lead to output format biases. Our results highlight the need to mitigate the output format bias to enable reliable evaluations in LLMs for code translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version (v2) is a journal extension of our previous conference submission that was accepted into the 2024 IEEE/ACM First International Conference on AI Foundation Models and Software Engineering (Forge 2024), which includes new experiments and results</p></details> |

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Existing ML models struggle with noisy data types, imbalances, pattern recognition, feature extraction, and generalization. To address these challenges, we develop a new model, Adaptive Differential Evolution (ADE) based Quantum Variational Autoencoder-Transformer (QVAET) Model (ADE-QVAET). ADE combines with QVAET to obtain high-dimensional latent features and maintain sequential dependencies, resulting in enhanced defect prediction accuracy. ADE optimization enhances model convergence and predictive performance. ADE-QVAET integrates AI-ML techniques such as tuning hyperparameters for scalable and accurate software defect prediction, representing an AI-ML-driven technology for quality engineering. During training with a 90% training percentage, ADE-QVAET achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.08%, 92.45%, 94.67%, and 98.12%, respectively, when compared to the Differential Evolution (DE) ML model.</p></details> |  |

| **[LineBreaker: Finding Token-Inconsistency Bugs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01668v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token-inconsistency bugs (TIBs) involve the misuse of syntactically valid yet incorrect code tokens, such as misused variables and erroneous function invocations, which can often lead to software bugs. Unlike simple syntactic bugs, TIBs occur at the semantic level and are subtle - sometimes they remain undetected for years. Traditional detection methods, such as static analysis and dynamic testing, often struggle with TIBs due to their versatile and context-dependent nature. However, advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 present new opportunities for automating TIB detection by leveraging these models' semantic understanding capabilities. This paper reports the first systematic measurement of LLMs' capabilities in detecting TIBs, revealing that while GPT-4 shows promise, it exhibits limitations in precision and scalability. Specifically, its detection capability is undermined by the model's tendency to focus on the code snippets that do not contain TIBs; its scalability concern arises from GPT-4's high cost and the massive amount of code requiring inspection. To address these challenges, we introduce \name, a novel and cascaded TIB detection system. \name leverages smaller, code-specific, and highly efficient language models to filter out large numbers of code snippets unlikely to contain TIBs, thereby significantly enhancing the system's performance in terms of precision, recall, and scalability. We evaluated \name on 154 Python and C GitHub repositories, each with over 1,000 stars, uncovering 123 new flaws, 45\% of which could be exploited to disrupt program functionalities. Out of our 69 submitted fixes, 41 have already been confirmed or merged.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 Accepted, with Appendix added</p></details> |

| **[An Empirical Study of Python Library Migration Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13272v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Library migration is the process of replacing one library with another library that provides similar functionality. Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone, as it requires developers to understand the APIs of both libraries, map them, and perform the necessary code transformations. Large Language Models (LLMs) are shown to be effective at generating and transforming code as well as finding similar code, which are necessary upstream tasks for library migration. Such capabilities suggest that LLMs may be suitable for library migration. Accordingly, this paper investigates the effectiveness of LLMs for migration between Python libraries. We evaluate three LLMs, Llama 3.1, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4o on PyMigBench, where we migrate 321 real-world library migrations that include 2,989 migration-related code changes. To measure correctness, we (1) compare the LLM's migrated code with the developers' migrated code in the benchmark and (2) run the unit tests available in the client repositories. We find that LLama 3.1, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4o correctly migrate 89%, 89%, and 94% of the migration-related code changes, respectively. We also find that 36%, 52% and 64% of the LLama 3.1, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4o migrations pass the same tests that passed in the developer's migration. To ensure the LLMs are not reciting the migrations, we also evaluate them on 10 new repositories where the migration never happened. Overall, our results suggest that LLMs can be effective in migrating code between libraries, but we also identify some open challenges.</p></details> |  |

| **[Large Language Models are overconfident and amplify human bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02151v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing every aspect of society. They are increasingly used in problem-solving tasks to substitute human assessment and reasoning. LLMs are trained on what humans write and are thus exposed to human bias. We evaluate whether LLMs inherit one of the most widespread human biases: overconfidence. We algorithmically construct reasoning problems with known ground truths. We prompt LLMs to answer these problems and assess the confidence in their answers, closely following similar protocols in human experiments. We find that all five LLMs we study are overconfident: they overestimate the probability that their answer is correct between 20% and 60%. Humans have accuracy similar to the more advanced LLMs, but far lower overconfidence. Although humans and LLMs are similarly biased in questions which they are certain they answered correctly, a key difference emerges between them: LLM bias increases sharply relative to humans if they become less sure that their answers are correct. We also show that LLM input has ambiguous effects on human decision making: LLM input leads to an increase in the accuracy, but it more than doubles the extent of overconfidence in the answers.</p></details> |  |

However, these AI-assisted workflows can also significantly alter the developer's role, raising concerns about control, output quality, and learning, particularly for novice developers. This study investigates how novice software developers with foundational knowledge in software testing interact with generative AI for engineering unit tests. Our goal is to examine the strategies they use, how heavily they rely on generative AI, and the benefits and challenges they perceive when using generative AI-assisted approaches for test engineering. We conducted an observational study involving 12 undergraduate students who worked with generative AI for unit testing tasks. We identified four interaction strategies, defined by whether the test idea or the test implementation originated from generative AI or the participant. Additionally, we singled out prompting styles that focused on one-shot or iterative test generation, which often aligned with the broader interaction strategy. Students reported benefits including time-saving, reduced cognitive load, and support for test ideation, but also noted drawbacks such as diminished trust, test quality concerns, and lack of ownership. While strategy and prompting styles influenced workflow dynamics, they did not significantly affect test effectiveness or test code quality as measured by mutation score or test smells.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, journal submission</p></details> |

| **[ECO: Enhanced Code Optimization via Performance-Aware Prompting for Code-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10517v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code runtime optimization-the task of rewriting a given code to a faster one-remains challenging, as it requires reasoning about performance trade-offs involving algorithmic and structural choices. Recent approaches employ code-LLMs with slow-fast code pairs provided as optimization guidance, but such pair-based methods obscure the causal factors of performance gains and often lead to superficial pattern imitation rather than genuine performance reasoning. We introduce ECO, a performance-aware prompting framework for code optimization. ECO first distills runtime optimization instructions (ROIs) from reference slow-fast code pairs; Each ROI describes root causes of inefficiency and the rationales that drive performance improvements. For a given input code, ECO in parallel employs (i) a symbolic advisor to produce a bottleneck diagnosis tailored to the code, and (ii) an ROI retriever to return related ROIs. These two outputs are then composed into a performance-aware prompt, providing actionable guidance for code-LLMs. ECO's prompts are model-agnostic, require no fine-tuning, and can be easily prepended to any code-LLM prompt. Our empirical studies highlight that ECO prompting significantly improves code-LLMs' ability to generate efficient code, achieving speedups of up to 7.81x while minimizing correctness loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-Incorporating Code Structural Knowledge into Pretrained Models via ICL for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22776v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation migrates codebases across programming languages. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in software mining. However, handling the syntactic structure of source code remains a challenge. Classic syntax-aware methods depend on intricate model architectures and loss functions, rendering their integration into LLM training resource-intensive. This paper employs in-context learning (ICL), which directly integrates task exemplars into the input context, to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into pre-trained LLMs. We revisit exemplar selection in ICL from an information-theoretic perspective, proposing that list-wise selection based on information coverage is more precise and general objective than traditional methods based on combining similarity and diversity. To address the challenges of quantifying information coverage, we introduce a surrogate measure, Coverage of Abstract Syntax Tree (CAST). Furthermore, we formulate the NP-hard CAST maximization for exemplar selection and prove that it is a standard submodular maximization problem. Therefore, we propose a greedy algorithm for CAST submodular maximization, which theoretically guarantees a (1-1/e)-approximate solution in polynomial time complexity. Our method is the first training-free and model-agnostic approach to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into existing LLMs at test time. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves LLMs performance and reveals two meaningful insights: 1) Code structural knowledge can be effectively post-incorporated into pre-trained LLMs during inference, despite being overlooked during training; 2) Scaling up model size or training data does not lead to the emergence of code structural knowledge, underscoring the necessity of explicitly considering code syntactic structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Testing and Enhancing Multi-Agent Systems for Robust Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10460v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks by decomposing complex coding tasks across specialized agents with different roles. Despite their prosperous development and adoption, their robustness remains pressingly under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world deployment. This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the robustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing approach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness flaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they initially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving mutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet largely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between planning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding agents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a multi-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a repairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new monitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for developing more reliable MASs for code generation.</p></details> | 19pages, 5 figures |

Recent work addresses these limitations by exploring DFA decomposition identification problems (DFA-DIPs), which model system behavior as intersections of multiple DFAs, offering modularity for complex tasks. However, existing DFA-DIP approaches depend on SAT encodings derived from Augmented Prefix Tree Acceptors (APTAs), incurring scalability limitations due to their inherent redundancy. In this work, we advance DFA-DIP research through studying two variants: the traditional Pareto-optimal DIP and the novel states-optimal DIP, which prioritizes a minimal number of states. We propose a novel framework that bridges DFA decomposition with recent advancements in automata representation. One of our key innovations replaces APTA with 3-valued DFA (3DFA) derived directly from labeled examples. This compact representation eliminates redundancies of APTA, thus drastically reducing variables in the improved SAT encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3DFA-based approach achieves significant efficiency gains for the Pareto-optimal DIP while enabling a scalable solution for the states-optimal DIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper accepted by SETTA 2025</p></details> |

This challenge is amplified in Large Language Models (LLMs) by two interconnected failures: they operate as unauditable "black boxes" lacking a transparent reasoning process, and consequently, generate code riddled with critical security vulnerabilities. To address both issues, we propose SmartCoder-R1 (based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B), a novel framework for secure and explainable smart contract generation. It begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) to specialize the model. We then apply Long Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (L-CoT SFT) on 7,998 expert-validated reasoning-and-code samples to train the model to emulate human security analysis. Finally, to directly mitigate vulnerabilities, we employ Security-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a reinforcement learning phase that refines the generation policy by optimizing a weighted reward signal for compilation success, security compliance, and format correctness. Evaluated against 17 baselines on a benchmark of 756 real-world functions, SmartCoder-R1 establishes a new state of the art, achieving top performance across five key metrics: a ComPass of 87.70%, a VulRate of 8.60%, a SafeAval of 80.16%, a FuncRate of 53.84%, and a FullRate of 50.53%. This FullRate marks a 45.79% relative improvement over the strongest baseline, DeepSeek-R1. Crucially, its generated reasoning also excels in human evaluations, achieving high-quality ratings for Functionality (82.7%), Security (85.3%), and Clarity (90.7%).</p></details> |  |

Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages, and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.</p></details> | 8 pages, two columns |

In many software teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented by only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these experts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct cybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support cybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats during the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of leveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain while complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit external data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts in interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project. The results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by generating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing redundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight to ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing to utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely relying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that encourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of cyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Autonomous Agents in Software Engineering (AgenticSE) Workshop, co-located with ASE 2025</p></details> |

Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines these graph representations with light-weight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over Graph Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable, explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights, facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, 14 equations, accepted at the 14th International Conference on Complex Networks and Their Applications (COMPLEX NETWORKS 2025) and the conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Studies in Computational Intelligence series</p></details> |

An important step in capacity management is predicting future resource needs often relies on data-driven analytics and machine learning (ML) forecasting models, which require frequent retraining to stay relevant as data evolves. Continuously retraining the forecasting models can be expensive and difficult to scale, posing a challenge for engineering teams tasked with balancing accuracy and efficiency. Retraining only when the data changes appears to be a more computationally efficient alternative, but its impact on accuracy requires further investigation. In this work, we investigate the effects of retraining capacity forecasting models for time series based on detected changes in the data compared to periodic retraining. Our results show that drift-based retraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in most cases, making it a cost-effective strategy. However, in cases where data is changing rapidly, periodic retraining is still preferred to maximize the forecasting accuracy. These findings offer actionable insights for software teams to enhance forecasting systems, reducing retraining overhead while maintaining robust performance.</p></details> |  |

While many methods detect test smells, few support automated removal, and most rely on static analysis or machine learning. This study evaluates models with relatively small parameter counts - Llama-3.2-3B, Gemma-2-9B, DeepSeek-R1-14B, and Phi-4-14B - for their ability to detect and refactor test smells using agent-based workflows. We assess workflows with one, two, and four agents over 150 instances of 5 common smells from real-world Java projects. Our approach generalizes to Python, Golang, and JavaScript. All models detected nearly all instances, with Phi-4-14B achieving the best refactoring accuracy (pass@5 of 75.3%). Phi-4-14B with four-agents performed within 5% of proprietary LLMs (single-agent). Multi-agent setups outperformed single-agent ones in three of five smell types, though for Assertion Roulette, one agent sufficed. We submitted pull requests with Phi-4-14B-generated code to open-source projects and six were merged.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Software</p></details> |

Academic research, industrial projects (e.g., Amazon Braket, IBM Qiskit), and consortiums like 'Quantum Flagship' are striving to develop practically capable and commercially viable quantum computing (QC) systems and technologies. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is viewed as a solution attuned to the philosophy of service-orientation that can offer QC resources and platforms, as utility computing, to individuals and organisations who do not own quantum computers. This research investigates a process-centric and architecture-driven approach to offer a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS - a.k.a quantum service-orientation. We employed a two-phase research method comprising (a) a systematic mapping study and (b) an architecture-based development, first to identify the phases of the quantum service development life cycle and subsequently to integrate these phases into a reference architecture that supports QCaaS. The SMS process retrieved a collection of potentially relevant research literature and based on a multi-step selection and qualitative assessment, we selected 41 peer-reviewed studies to answer three RQs. The RQs investigate (i) demographic details in terms of frequency, types, and trends of research, (ii) phases of quantum service development lifecycle to derive a reference architecture for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of services, and (iii) The results identify a 4-phased development lifecycle along with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations, catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can be integrated in a layered reference architecture to engineer QCaaS.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 images, 5 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

We present a production system for grounded, PR-native review that pairs static-analysis findings with AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack (quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise explanations and remediation guidance. Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++ standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50 build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and limitations, emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader standards and assisted patching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MLSys 2026</p></details> |

However, LLM-generated code still suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from 0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in pass@k while using less preference data.

| **[Learning to Guarantee Type Correctness in Code Generation through Type-Guided Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10216v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation; nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs are All You Need? Improving Fuzz Testing for MOJO with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10179v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing, which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity. Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches. Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-aligned AI Model Cards with Weighted Hierarchy Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06989v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a burgeoning ecosystem of specialized, domain-specific models. While this rapid growth accelerates innovation, it has simultaneously created significant challenges in model discovery and adoption. Users struggle to navigate this landscape due to inconsistent, incomplete, and imbalanced documentation across platforms. Existing documentation frameworks, such as Model Cards and FactSheets, attempt to standardize reporting but are often static, predominantly qualitative, and lack the quantitative mechanisms needed for rigorous cross-model comparison. This gap exacerbates model underutilization and hinders responsible adoption. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Comprehensive Responsible AI Model Card Framework (CRAI-MCF), a novel approach that transitions from static disclosures to actionable, human-aligned documentation. Grounded in Value Sensitive Design (VSD), CRAI-MCF is built upon an empirical analysis of 240 open-source projects, distilling 217 parameters into an eight-module, value-aligned architecture. Our framework introduces a quantitative sufficiency criterion to operationalize evaluation and enables rigorous cross-model comparison under a unified scheme. By balancing technical, ethical, and operational dimensions, CRAI-MCF empowers practitioners to efficiently assess, select, and adopt LLMs with greater confidence and operational integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

Among many downstream tasks, generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits plays a central role in vulnerability reproduction, comprehension, and mitigation. While previous research has focused primarily on zero-day exploitation, the growing availability of rich public information accompanying disclosed CVEs leads to a natural question: can LLMs effectively use this information to automatically generate valid PoCs? In this paper, we present the first empirical study of LLM-based PoC generation for web application vulnerabilities, focusing on the practical feasibility of leveraging publicly disclosed information. We evaluate GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real-world and reproducible CVEs across three stages of vulnerability disclosure: (1) newly disclosed vulnerabilities with only descriptions, (2) 1-day vulnerabilities with patches, and (3) N-day vulnerabilities with full contextual code. Our results show that LLMs can automatically generate working PoCs in 8%-34% of cases using only public data, with DeepSeek-R1 consistently outperforming GPT-4o. Further analysis shows that supplementing code context improves success rates by 17%-20%, with function-level providing 9%-13% improvement than file-level ones. Further integrating adaptive reasoning strategies to prompt refinement significantly improves success rates to 68%-72%. Our findings suggest that LLMs could reshape vulnerability exploitation dynamics. To date, 23 newly generated PoCs have been accepted by NVD and Exploit DB.</p></details> |  |

The ultimate goal is to discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log. Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce CodeCrash, a stress-testing framework with 1,279 questions from CruxEval and LiveCodeBench, designed to evaluate reasoning reliability under structural perturbations and misleading natural language (NL) contexts. Through a systematic evaluation of 17 LLMs, we find that models often shortcut reasoning by over-relying on NL cues, leading to an average performance degradation of 23.2% in output prediction tasks. Even with Chain-of-Thought reasoning, models on average still have a 13.8% drop due to distractibility and rationalization, revealing a lack of critical reasoning capability to distinguish the actual code behaviors. While Large Reasoning Models with internal reasoning mechanisms improve robustness by fostering critical thinking, plausible yet incorrect hints can trigger pathological self-reflection, causing 2-3 times token consumption and even catastrophic cognitive dissonance in extreme cases for QwQ-32B. We refer to this phenomenon as Reasoning Collapse. CodeCrash provides a rigorous benchmark for evaluating robustness in code reasoning, guiding future research and development toward more reliable and resilient models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 10 pages of main text; 25 pages of appendices.

Many mainstream libraries implement a large number of vectorized algorithms on Arm or x86 SIMD intrinsic functions. With the rapid expansion of the RISC-V hardware-software ecosystem, there is a growing demand for support of the RISC-V Vector (RVV) extension. Translating existing vectorized intrinsic code onto RVV intrinsics is a practical and effective approach. However, current cross-architecture translation largely relies on manual rewriting, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Furthermore, while some rule-based methods can reduce the need for manual intervention, their translation success rate is limited by incomplete rule coverage and syntactic constraints, and the performance suffers from inadequate utilization of RVV-specific features. We present IntrinTrans, a LLM-based multi-agent approach that utilizes compile-and-test feedback to translate intrinsic code across architectures automatically, and further optimizes the generated RVV intrinsics using register-usage information derived from liveness analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we collected 34 vectorized algorithm cases from open-source libraries. Each case includes an Arm Neon intrinsics implementation and a RVV intrinsics implementation contributed by the open-source community, together with correctness and performance tests. Our experiments show that advanced LLMs produce semantically correct RISC-V Vector intrinsics in most cases within a limited number of iterations, and in some cases achieve up to 5.93x the performance of the native implementation from the open-source community.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[A Mathematics-Guided Approach to Floating-Point Error Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10081v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Floating-point program errors can lead to severe consequences, particularly in critical domains such as military applications. Only a small subset of inputs may induce substantial floating-point errors, prompting researchers to develop methods for identifying these error-inducing inputs. Although existing approaches have achieved some success, they still suffer from two major limitations: (1) High computational cost: The evaluation of error magnitude for candidate inputs relies on high-precision programs, which are prohibitively time-consuming. (2) Limited long-range convergence capability: Current methods exhibit inefficiency in search, making the process akin to finding a needle in a haystack. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel method, named MGDE, to detect error-inducing inputs based on mathematical guidance. By employing the Newton-Raphson method, which exhibits quadratic convergence properties, we achieve highly effective and efficient results. Since the goal of identifying error-inducing inputs is to uncover the underlying bugs, we use the number of bugs detected in floating-point programs as the primary evaluation metric in our experiments. As FPCC represents the most effective state-of-the-art approach to date, we use it as the baseline for comparison. The dataset of FPCC consists of 88 single-input floating-point programs. FPCC is able to detect 48 bugs across 29 programs, whereas our method successfully identifies 89 bugs across 44 programs. Moreover, FPCC takes 6.4096 times as long as our proposed method. We also deploy our method to multi-input programs, identifying a total of nine bugs with an average detection time of 0.6443 seconds per program. In contrast, FPCC fails to detect any bugs while requiring an average computation time of 100 seconds per program.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Labyrinth: Path-Sensitive Unit Test Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23812v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for software quality assurance, yet writing and maintaining tests remains time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various techniques for automating unit test generation, including traditional heuristic-based methods and more recent approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs). However, these existing approaches are inherently path-insensitive because they rely on fixed heuristics or limited contextual information and fail to reason about deep control-flow structures. As a result, they often struggle to achieve adequate coverage, particularly for deep or complex execution paths. In this work, we present a path-sensitive framework, JUnitGenie, to fill this gap by combining code knowledge with the semantic capabilities of LLMs in guiding context-aware unit test generation. After extracting code knowledge from Java projects, JUnitGenie distills this knowledge into structured prompts to guide the generation of high-coverage unit tests. We evaluate JUnitGenie on 2,258 complex focal methods from ten real-world Java projects. The results show that JUnitGenie generates valid tests and improves branch and line coverage by 29.60% and 31.00% on average over both heuristic and LLM-based baselines. We further demonstrate that the generated test cases can uncover real-world bugs, which were later confirmed and fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluations typically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of whether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect transformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and erode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this gap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript obfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to generate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language constructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable programs and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides LLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic extraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more focused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain knowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown correctness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE, Fuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary focus on obfuscation induced misbehavior. An ablation shows that all components except our generic MRs contribute to at least one bug class; the negative MR result suggests the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations. Our results also seed discussion on how to balance obfuscation presets and performance cost. We envision OBsmith as an important step towards automated testing and quality assurance of obfuscators and other semantic-preserving toolchains.</p></details> |  |

Unlike functionality issues, performance issues are more difficult to diagnose and resolve due to their complex root causes, which often emerge only under specific conditions or payloads. Although many efforts haven attempt to mitigate the impact of performance issues by developing methods to automatically identify and resolve them, it remains unclear if this objective has been fulfilled, and the existing approaches indeed targeted on the most critical performance issues encountered in real-world settings. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of Android performance issues in real-world applications and literature. Specifically, we started by investigating real-world performance issues, their underlying root causes (i.e., contributing factors), and common code patterns. We then took an additional step to empirically summarize existing approaches and datasets through a literature review, assessing how well academic research reflects the real-world challenges faced by developers and users. Our comparison results show a substantial divergence exists in the primary performance concerns of researchers, developers, and users. Among all the identified factors, 57.14% have not been examined in academic research, while a substantial 76.39% remain unaddressed by existing tools, and 66.67% lack corresponding datasets. This stark contrast underscores a substantial gap in our understanding and management of performance issues. Consequently, it is crucial for our community to intensify efforts to bridge these gaps and achieve comprehensive detection and resolution of performance issues.</p></details> |  |

Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69 AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95% CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90% relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1 inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus 28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%) occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points; arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven, provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis with end-to-end auditability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, link to code repo</p></details> |

In response, the concept of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility, versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development. However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied, MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational settings.</p></details> |  |

In practice, some errors can be fixed using original-precision arithmetic, while others require high-precision computation. Developers often avoid addressing the latter due to excessive computational resources required. However, they sometimes struggle to distinguish between these two types of errors, and existing repair tools fail to assist in this differentiation. Most current repair tools rely on high-precision implementations, which are time-consuming to develop and demand specialized expertise. Although a few tools do not require high-precision programs, they can only fix a limited subset of errors or produce suboptimal results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named OFP-Repair.On ACESO's dataset, our patches achieve improvements of three, seven, three, and eight orders of magnitude across four accuracy metrics. In real-world cases, our method successfully detects all five original-precision-repairable errors and fixes three, whereas ACESO only repairs one. Notably, these results are based on verified data and do not fully capture the potential of OFP-Repair. To further validate our method, we deploy it on a decade-old open bug report from GNU Scientific Library (GSL), successfully repairing five out of 15 bugs. The developers have expressed interest in our method and are considering integrating our tool into their development workflow. We are currently working on applying our patches to GSL. The results are highly encouraging, demonstrating the practical applicability of our technique.</p></details> |  |

The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

Despite growing interest, the literature lacks a cohesive synthesis of runtime composition in dynamic SoSs. Objective: This study synthesizes research on runtime composition in dynamic SoSs and identifies core challenges, solution strategies, supporting tools, and evaluation methods. Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and selecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges fall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system orchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs. Solutions span seven areas: co-simulation and digital twins, semantic ontologies, integration frameworks, adaptive architectures, middleware, formal methods, and AI-driven resilience. Service-oriented frameworks for composition and integration dominate tooling, while simulation platforms support evaluation. Interoperability across tools, limited cross-toolchain workflows, and the absence of standardized benchmarks remain key gaps. Evaluation approaches include simulation-based, implementation-driven, and human-centered studies, which have been applied in domains such as smart cities, healthcare, defense, and industrial automation. Conclusions: The synthesis reveals tensions, including autonomy versus coordination, the modeling-reality gap, and socio-technical integration. It calls for standardized evaluation metrics, scalable decentralized architectures, and cross-domain frameworks. The analysis aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing dynamically composable SoSs.</p></details> |  |

Existing concolic execution engines are significantly restricted by (1) input structure-agnostic path constraint selection, leading to the waste of testing effort or missing coverage; (2) limited constraint-solving capability, yielding many syntactically invalid test inputs; (3) reliance on manual acquisition of highly structured seed inputs, resulting in non-continuous testing. This paper proposes Cottontail, a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven concolic execution engine, to mitigate the above limitations. A more complete program path representation, named Expressive Structural Coverage Tree (ESCT), is first constructed to select structure-aware path constraints. Later, an LLM-driven constraint solver based on a Solve-Complete paradigm is designed to solve the path constraints smartly to get test inputs that are not only satisfiable to the constraints but also valid to the input syntax. Finally, a history-guided seed acquisition is employed to obtain new highly structured test inputs either before testing starts or after testing is saturated. We implemented Cottontail on top of SymCC and evaluated eight extensively tested open-source libraries across four different formats (XML, SQL, JavaScript, and JSON). Cottontail significantly outperforms baseline approaches by 30.73% and 41.32% on average in terms of line and branch coverage. Besides, Cottontail found six previously unknown vulnerabilities (six CVEs assigned). We have reported these issues to developers, and four out of them have been fixed so far.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the 2026 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (22 pages, with detailed Appendix)</p></details> |
| **[MooseAgent: A LLM Based Multi-agent Framework for Automating Moose Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08621v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific computing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing stages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 Figs |

Identifying the technical, organizational and social factors that lead to differences in engagement is required to remove barriers and utilize enablers for testing. While much research emphasizes the usefulness of testing strategies and technical solutions, less is known about why developers do (not) test. This study investigates the lived experience of software developers to illuminate how their opinions about testing change. Learning about personal evolutions of practice, we explore when and why testing is used. Employing socio-technical grounded theory (STGT), we construct a theory by systematically analyzing data from 19 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with software developers. Allowing interviewees to reflect on how and why they approach software testing, we explore perspectives that are rooted in their contextual experiences. We develop eleven categories of circumstances that act as conditions for the application and adaptation of testing practices and introduce three concepts that we then use to present our theory of emerging testing strategies (ETS) that explains why developers do (not) use testing practices. This study reveals a new perspective on the connection between testing artifacts and collective reflection of practitioners, and it embraces testing as an experience in which human- and social aspects are entangled with organizational and technical circumstances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print, submitted to EMSE Journal (Springer), First Revision</p></details> |

Among all software issues, security issues are the most important to identify, as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions. Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the manual efforts required in the secure code review process. Despite the progress, current automated approaches on secure code review, including static analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automated secure code review approach based on large language models (LLMs). iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-prompts architecture that incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage of security issues. Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a specific security issue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of iCodeReviewer in security issue identification and localization with an F1 of 63.98%. The review comments generated by iCodeReviewer also achieve a high acceptance rate up to 84% when it is deployed in production environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Engineering Multi-Agent LLMs: A Protocol-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12120v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for software development has driven interest in automating software engineering (SE) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with verification, and is implemented atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6% reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Neural Code Representation with Additional Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12082v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program comprehension underpins many software engineering tasks, from code summarisation to clone detection. Recent deep learning models achieve strong results but typically rely on source code alone, overlooking contextual information such as version history or structural relationships. This limits their ability to capture how code evolves and operates. We conduct an empirical study on how enriching code representations with such contextual signals affects neural model performance on key comprehension tasks. Two downstream tasks, code clone detection and code summarisation, are evaluated using SeSaMe (1,679 Java methods) and CodeSearchNet (63,259 methods). Five representative models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, ASTNN) are fine-tuned under code-only and context-augmented settings. Results show that context generally improves performance: version history consistently boosts clone detection (e.g., CodeT5 +15.92% F1) and summarisation (e.g., GraphCodeBERT +5.56% METEOR), while call-graph effects vary by model and task. Combining multiple contexts yields further gains (up to +21.48% macro-F1). Human evaluation on 100 Java snippets confirms that context-augmented summaries are significantly preferred for Accuracy and Content Adequacy (p <= 0.026; |delta| up to 0.55). These findings highlight the potential of contextual signals to enhance code comprehension and open new directions for optimising contextual encoding in neural SE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+, primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold: First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to be false alarms. To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software verifiers to catch real-world bugs.</p></details> | under submission |

We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code $+$ diff $\rightarrow$ new code), anti-apply (new code $-$ diff $\rightarrow$ old code), and diff generation (new code $-$ old code $\rightarrow$ diff). Instances in the benchmark are triples $\langle \textit{old code}, \textit{new code}, \textit{diff} \rangle$ drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For example, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models in the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and smaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/diff-xyz.</p></details> |  |

Verbalization techniques (methods that capture spoken or written thought processes) offer a lightweight and accessible way to study these cognitive aspects. This paper presents a scoping review of research at the intersection of SE and psychology (PSY), focusing on the use of verbal data. To make large-scale interdisciplinary reviews feasible, we employed a large language model (LLM)-assisted screening pipeline using GPT to assess the relevance of over 9,000 papers based solely on titles. We addressed two questions: what themes emerge from verbalization-related work in SE, and how effective are LLMs in supporting interdisciplinary review processes? We validated GPT's outputs against human reviewers and found high consistency, with a 13\% disagreement rate. Prominent themes mainly were tied to the craft of SE, while more human-centered topics were underrepresented. The data also suggests that SE frequently draws on PSY methods, whereas the reverse is rare.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint of a paper under publication in Quality of Information and Communications Technology 2025</p></details> |

The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

Despite growing interest, the literature lacks a cohesive synthesis of runtime composition in dynamic SoSs. Objective: This study synthesizes research on runtime composition in dynamic SoSs and identifies core challenges, solution strategies, supporting tools, and evaluation methods. Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and selecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges fall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system orchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs. Solutions span seven areas: co-simulation and digital twins, semantic ontologies, integration frameworks, adaptive architectures, middleware, formal methods, and AI-driven resilience. Service-oriented frameworks for composition and integration dominate tooling, while simulation platforms support evaluation. Interoperability across tools, limited cross-toolchain workflows, and the absence of standardized benchmarks remain key gaps. Evaluation approaches include simulation-based, implementation-driven, and human-centered studies, which have been applied in domains such as smart cities, healthcare, defense, and industrial automation. Conclusions: The synthesis reveals tensions, including autonomy versus coordination, the modeling-reality gap, and socio-technical integration. It calls for standardized evaluation metrics, scalable decentralized architectures, and cross-domain frameworks. The analysis aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing dynamically composable SoSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can ChatGPT support software verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |

Later, an LLM-driven constraint solver based on a Solve-Complete paradigm is designed to solve the path constraints smartly to get test inputs that are not only satisfiable to the constraints but also valid to the input syntax. Finally, a history-guided seed acquisition is employed to obtain new highly structured test inputs either before testing starts or after testing is saturated. We implemented Cottontail on top of SymCC and evaluated eight extensively tested open-source libraries across four different formats (XML, SQL, JavaScript, and JSON). Cottontail significantly outperforms baseline approaches by 30.73% and 41.32% on average in terms of line and branch coverage. Besides, Cottontail found six previously unknown vulnerabilities (six CVEs assigned). We have reported these issues to developers, and four out of them have been fixed so far.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the 2026 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (22 pages, with detailed Appendix)</p></details> |

Although these models are widely adopted, their accuracy and precision remain underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study evaluating how well such models reflect actual energy consumption during realistic user interactions with common website categories. Energy use was measured across shopping, booking, navigation, and news services using predefined user flows executed on four laptop platforms. The results show that the commonly applied constant-power approximation (P * t) can diverge substantially from measured energy, depending on website category, device type, and task characteristics. The findings demonstrate that model deviations are systematic rather than random and highlight the need for category-aware and device-reflective power parameters in reproducible sustainability reporting frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The EmpathiSEr: Development and Validation of Software Engineering Oriented Empathy Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12546v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empathy plays a critical role in software engineering (SE), influencing collaboration, communication, and user-centred design. Although SE research has increasingly recognised empathy as a key human aspect, there remains no validated instrument specifically designed to measure it within the unique socio-technical contexts of SE. Existing generic empathy scales, while well-established in psychology and healthcare, often rely on language, scenarios, and assumptions that are not meaningful or interpretable for software practitioners. These scales fail to account for the diverse, role-specific, and domain-bound expressions of empathy in SE, such as understanding a non-technical user's frustrations or another practitioner's technical constraints, which differ substantially from empathy in clinical or everyday contexts. To address this gap, we developed and validated two domain-specific empathy scales: EmpathiSEr-P, assessing empathy among practitioners, and EmpathiSEr-U, capturing practitioner empathy towards users. Grounded in a practitioner-informed conceptual framework, the scales encompass three dimensions of empathy: cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and empathic responses. We followed a rigorous, multi-phase methodology, including expert evaluation, cognitive interviews, and two practitioner surveys. The resulting instruments represent the first psychometrically validated empathy scales tailored to SE, offering researchers and practitioners a tool for assessing empathy and designing empathy-enhancing interventions in software teams and user interactions.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics simulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand user-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task decomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to automatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model hallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing annotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted experimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer, mechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that MooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent, especially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively simple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its potential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the user barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite element simulation software. The code for the MooseAgent framework proposed in this paper has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/taozhan18/MooseAgent</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 Figs |

Yet, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to be false alarms. To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software verifiers to catch real-world bugs.</p></details> | under submission |
| **[On the Robustness Evaluation of 3D Obstacle Detection Against Specifications in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13653v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) rely on real-time sensor data, such as cameras and LiDARs, for time-critical decisions using deep neural networks. The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

Prior literature focused on how data protection regulations are discussed for software in operation, or how this topic is discussed in various channels outside of the software development process. Yet, what is missing, is a perspective on the impact of such regulations on the software development process. In our work, we address this gap, and explore how discussions during the development of software are impacted by regulations, who reports and discusses issues related to personal data and data protection, and how developers react to those issues. To that end, we used inductive coding to analyze 652 issues from Open Source GitHub projects and used the codes to quantitatively analyze the relation between the roles, resolutions, and data protection issues to understand correlations and predict resolutions of issues. Most notably we observed a significant increase in reporting when GDPR came into effect. The most common issue types were feature requests for privacy enhancement, which were mainly reported and discussed by frequent reporters and frequent committers. But especially issues regarding privacy enhancement were also frequently reported by one-time reporters. Most of the requests were solved without opposing votes. All in all, our findings indicate that data protection regulations effectively start discussions about privacy within the software development community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |

Despite growing interest, the literature lacks a cohesive synthesis of runtime composition in dynamic SoSs. Objective: This study synthesizes research on runtime composition in dynamic SoSs and identifies core challenges, solution strategies, supporting tools, and evaluation methods. Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and selecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges fall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system orchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs. Solutions span seven areas: co-simulation and digital twins, semantic ontologies, integration frameworks, adaptive architectures, middleware, formal methods, and AI-driven resilience. Service-oriented frameworks for composition and integration dominate tooling, while simulation platforms support evaluation. Interoperability across tools, limited cross-toolchain workflows, and the absence of standardized benchmarks remain key gaps. Evaluation approaches include simulation-based, implementation-driven, and human-centered studies, which have been applied in domains such as smart cities, healthcare, defense, and industrial automation. Conclusions: The synthesis reveals tensions, including autonomy versus coordination, the modeling-reality gap, and socio-technical integration. It calls for standardized evaluation metrics, scalable decentralized architectures, and cross-domain frameworks. The analysis aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing dynamically composable SoSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can ChatGPT support software verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |

Existing concolic execution engines are significantly restricted by (1) input structure-agnostic path constraint selection, leading to the waste of testing effort or missing coverage; (2) limited constraint-solving capability, yielding many syntactically invalid test inputs; (3) reliance on manual acquisition of highly structured seed inputs, resulting in non-continuous testing. This paper proposes Cottontail, a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven concolic execution engine, to mitigate the above limitations. A more complete program path representation, named Expressive Structural Coverage Tree (ESCT), is first constructed to select structure-aware path constraints.

| **[A Cooperative Approach for Knowledge-based Business Process Design in a Public Authority](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19842v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprises are currently undergoing profound transformations due to the unpostponable digital transformation. Then, to remain competitive, enterprises must adapt digital solutions, transforming their organisational structures and operations. This organisational shift is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises. A key innovation frontier is the adoption of process-oriented production models. This paper presents a knowledge-based method to support business experts in designing business processes. The method requires no prior expertise in Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations. The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders and actors who participate in the BP design.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code $+$ diff $\rightarrow$ new code), anti-apply (new code $-$ diff $\rightarrow$ old code), and diff generation (new code $-$ old code $\rightarrow$ diff). Instances in the benchmark are triples $\langle \textit{old code}, \textit{new code}, \textit{diff} \rangle$ drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For example, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models in the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and smaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/diff-xyz.</p></details> |  |

This feature promises to facilitate the creation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and interfacing with existing system descriptions and technical designs. In this paper, we review these features and evaluate SysMLv2's capabilities using concrete use cases. We develop DarTwin DSL, a DSL that formalizes the existing DarTwin notation for Digital Twin (DT) evolution, through SysMLv2, thereby supposedly enabling the wide application of DarTwin's evolution templates using any SysMLv2 tool. We demonstrate DarTwin DSL, but also point out limitations in the currently available tooling of SysMLv2 in terms of graphical notation capabilities. This work contributes to the growing field of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) for DTs and combines it with the release of SysMLv2, thus integrating a systematic approach with DT evolution management in systems engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, their results are often treated with caution, as the presumed high variability of performance in the cloud raises concerns about reproducibility and credibility. In a recent study, we empirically quantified the impact of this variability on benchmarking results by repeatedly executing a stream processing application benchmark at different times of the day over several months. Our analysis confirms that performance variability is indeed observable at the application level, although it is less pronounced than often assumed. The larger scale of our study compared to related work allowed us to identify subtle daily and weekly performance patterns. We now extend this investigation by examining whether a major global event, such as Black Friday, affects the outcomes of performance benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 16th Symposium on Software Performance 2025</p></details> |

While encoders can be configured to produce bitstreams that are decoder-friendly, estimating the decoding complexity and energy overhead for a given video is non-trivial. In this study, we systematically analyse the impact of disabling various coding tools and adjusting coding parameters in two AV1 encoders, libaom-av1 and SVT-AV1. Using system-level energy measurement tools like RAPL (Running Average Power Limit), Intel SoC Watch (integrated with VTune profiler), we quantify the resulting trade-offs between decoding complexity, energy consumption, and compression efficiency for decoding a bitstream. Our results demonstrate that specific encoder configurations can substantially reduce decoding complexity with minimal perceptual quality degradation. For libaom-av1, disabling CDEF, an in-loop filter gives us a mean reduction in decoding cycles by 10%. For SVT-AV1, using the in-built, fast-decode=2 preset achieves a more substantial 24% reduction in decoding cycles. These findings provide strategies for content providers to lower the energy footprint of AV1 video streaming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Camera-Ready paper for PCS 2025, 5 Pages</p></details> |

In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions: creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting, contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop Submission at the sixth decennial Aarhus conference in Workshop "The End of Programming (as we know it) - Envisioning Radical Re-Conceptualizations of Co-Coding with AI"</p></details> |

Identifying the technical, organizational and social factors that lead to differences in engagement is required to remove barriers and utilize enablers for testing. While much research emphasizes the usefulness of testing strategies and technical solutions, less is known about why developers do (not) test. This study investigates the lived experience of software developers to illuminate how their opinions about testing change. Learning about personal evolutions of practice, we explore when and why testing is used. Employing socio-technical grounded theory (STGT), we construct a theory by systematically analyzing data from 19 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with software developers. Allowing interviewees to reflect on how and why they approach software testing, we explore perspectives that are rooted in their contextual experiences. We develop eleven categories of circumstances that act as conditions for the application and adaptation of testing practices and introduce three concepts that we then use to present our theory of emerging testing strategies (ETS) that explains why developers do (not) use testing practices. This study reveals a new perspective on the connection between testing artifacts and collective reflection of practitioners, and it embraces testing as an experience in which human- and social aspects are entangled with organizational and technical circumstances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print, submitted to EMSE Journal (Springer), First Revision</p></details> |

A Scoping Review on Verbalization in Software Engineering with LLM-Assisted Screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12294v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how software developers think, make decisions, and behave remains a key challenge in software engineering (SE). Verbalization techniques (methods that capture spoken or written thought processes) offer a lightweight and accessible way to study these cognitive aspects. This paper presents a scoping review of research at the intersection of SE and psychology (PSY), focusing on the use of verbal data. To make large-scale interdisciplinary reviews feasible, we employed a large language model (LLM)-assisted screening pipeline using GPT to assess the relevance of over 9,000 papers based solely on titles. We addressed two questions: what themes emerge from verbalization-related work in SE, and how effective are LLMs in supporting interdisciplinary review processes? We validated GPT's outputs against human reviewers and found high consistency, with a 13\% disagreement rate. Prominent themes mainly were tied to the craft of SE, while more human-centered topics were underrepresented. The data also suggests that SE frequently draws on PSY methods, whereas the reverse is rare.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint of a paper under publication in Quality of Information and Communications Technology 2025</p></details> |

By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of Abmax.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

In this class of failures, a stressor such as a temporary spike in workload causes the system performance to drop and, subsequently, the system performance continues to remain low even when the stressor is removed. These failures have been reported by many large corporations and considered to be a rare but catastrophic source of availability outages in cloud systems. In this paper, we provide the mathematical foundations of metastability in request-response server systems. We model such systems using a domain-specific language. We show how to construct continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) that approximate the semantics of the programs through modeling and data-driven calibration. We use the structure of the CTMC models to provide a visualization of the qualitative behavior of the model. The visualization is a surprisingly effective way to identify system parameterizations that cause a system to show metastable behaviors. We complement the qualitative analysis with quantitative predictions. We provide a formal notion of metastable behaviors based on escape probabilities, and show that metastable behaviors are related to the eigenvalue structure of the CTMC. Our characterization leads to algorithmic tools to predict recovery times in metastable models of server systems. We have implemented our technique in a tool for the modeling and analysis of server systems. Through models inspired by failures in real request-response systems, we show that our qualitative visual analysis captures and predicts many instances of metastability that were observed in the field in a matter of milliseconds. Our algorithms confirm that recovery times surge as the system parameters approach metastable modes in the dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[iCodeReviewer: Improving Secure Code Review with Mixture of Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12186v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is an essential process to ensure the quality of software that identifies potential software issues at an early stage of software development. Among all software issues, security issues are the most important to identify, as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions. Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the manual efforts required in the secure code review process. Despite the progress, current automated approaches on secure code review, including static analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automated secure code review approach based on large language models (LLMs). iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-prompts architecture that incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage of security issues. Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a specific security issue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of iCodeReviewer in security issue identification and localization with an F1 of 63.98%. The review comments generated by iCodeReviewer also achieve a high acceptance rate up to 84% when it is deployed in production environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Engineering Multi-Agent LLMs: A Protocol-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12120v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for software development has driven interest in automating software engineering (SE) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with verification, and is implemented atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6% reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Neural Code Representation with Additional Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12082v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program comprehension underpins many software engineering tasks, from code summarisation to clone detection. Recent deep learning models achieve strong results but typically rely on source code alone, overlooking contextual information such as version history or structural relationships. This limits their ability to capture how code evolves and operates. We conduct an empirical study on how enriching code representations with such contextual signals affects neural model performance on key comprehension tasks. Two downstream tasks, code clone detection and code summarisation, are evaluated using SeSaMe (1,679 Java methods) and CodeSearchNet (63,259 methods). Five representative models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, ASTNN) are fine-tuned under code-only and context-augmented settings. Results show that context generally improves performance: version history consistently boosts clone detection (e.g., CodeT5 +15.92% F1) and summarisation (e.g., GraphCodeBERT +5.56% METEOR), while call-graph effects vary by model and task. Combining multiple contexts yields further gains (up to +21.48% macro-F1). Human evaluation on 100 Java snippets confirms that context-augmented summaries are significantly preferred for Accuracy and Content Adequacy (p <= 0.026; |delta| up to 0.55). These findings highlight the potential of contextual signals to enhance code comprehension and open new directions for optimising contextual encoding in neural SE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

These challenges can be addressed using generative AI. Given that GenAI based RE has not been systematically analyzed in detail, this review examines related research, focusing on trends, methodologies, challenges, and future directions. Methods: A systematic methodology for paper selection, data extraction, and feature analysis is used to comprehensively review 238 articles published from 2019 to 2025 and available from major academic databases. Results: Generative pretrained transformer models dominate current applications (67.3%), but research remains unevenly distributed across RE phases, with analysis (30.0%) and elicitation (22.1%) receiving the most attention, and management (6.8%) underexplored. Three core challenges: reproducibility (66.8%), hallucinations (63.4%), and interpretability (57.1%) form a tightly interlinked triad affecting trust and consistency. Strong correlations (35% cooccurrence) indicate these challenges must be addressed holistically. Industrial adoption remains nascent, with over 90% of studies corresponding to early stage development and only 1.3% reaching production level integration. Conclusions: Evaluation practices show maturity gaps, limited tool and dataset availability, and fragmented benchmarking approaches. Despite the transformative potential of GenAI based RE, several barriers hinder practical adoption. The strong correlations among core challenges demand specialized architectures targeting interdependencies rather than isolated solutions. The limited deployment reflects systemic bottlenecks in generalizability, data quality, and scalable evaluation methods. Successful adoption requires coordinated development across technical robustness, methodological maturity, and governance integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+, primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold: First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, these simulations typically require high-performance computing resources with numerous CPU cores, which are often inaccessible to many research groups and clinicians. To address this, we present TorchCor, a high-performance Python library for CEP simulations using the finite element method on general-purpose GPUs. Built on PyTorch, TorchCor significantly accelerates CEP simulations, particularly for large 3D meshes. The accuracy of the solver is verified against manufactured analytical solutions and the $N$-version benchmark problem.

| **[Phaedrus: Predicting Dynamic Application Behavior with Lightweight Generative Models and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06994v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application profiling is an indispensable technique for many software development tasks, such as code and memory layout optimizations, where optimization decisions are tailored to specific program profiles. Unfortunately, modern application codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.19\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 6.08\% (upto 20\%) performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization, without any execution.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |

Existing agent-based methods have two key limitations. First, they lack of procedural knowledge (i.e., how an issue is fixed step-by-step and rationales behind it) to learn and leverage for issue resolution. Second, they rely on massive computational power to blindly explore the solution space. % To address those limitations, we propose Lingxi, an issue resolution framework that leverages procedural knowledge extracted from historical issue-fixing data to guide agents in solving repository-level issues. \ourTool first constructs this knowledge offline through a hierarchical abstraction mechanism, enabling agents to learn the how and why behind a fix, not just the final solution. During online application, it employs a knowledge-driven scaling method that leverages the procedural knowledge of similar issues to intelligently analyze the target issue from multiple perspectives, in sharp contrast to undirected, brute-force exploration. % Lingxi successfully resolves 74.6\% of bugs on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark in Past@1 setting, outperforming five state-of-the-art techniques by a significant margin (5.4\% to 14.9\%). Our comprehensive ablation study confirmed that the success of Lingxi comes directly from its use of procedural knowledge. Without it, the performance gains from scaling alone is negligible. Our qualitative study further shows that the ``design patterns $\&$ coding practices'' is the most critical knowledge aspect, and that the roles of different knowledge aspects switch across different stages (i.e., analysis, planning, and fixing).</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Aware Reduction for Scalable LLM-Database Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11813v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable LLM--data integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, the mere completion of a programming task does not guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model, and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913 projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to their overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CompEd 2025</p></details> |

We present \textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts, enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user workflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API, and a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of deployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \textit{CodeWatcher} enables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich behavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development. This infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI, developer productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs.

While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis reveals \textbf{a striking Matthew effect: the more popular a programming language or framework, the higher the success rate of LLM-generated code}. The phenomenon suggests that AI systems may reinforce existing popularity hierarchies, accelerating convergence around dominant tools while hindering diversity and innovation. We provide a quantitative characterization of this effect and discuss its implications for the future evolution of programming ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

By adding the upload of the measurements to the Nyrki\"o change detection service, we made it possible to detect performance changes.

Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to be false alarms. To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software verifiers to catch real-world bugs.</p></details> | under submission |

Prior literature focused on how data protection regulations are discussed for software in operation, or how this topic is discussed in various channels outside of the software development process. Yet, what is missing, is a perspective on the impact of such regulations on the software development process. In our work, we address this gap, and explore how discussions during the development of software are impacted by regulations, who reports and discusses issues related to personal data and data protection, and how developers react to those issues. To that end, we used inductive coding to analyze 652 issues from Open Source GitHub projects and used the codes to quantitatively analyze the relation between the roles, resolutions, and data protection issues to understand correlations and predict resolutions of issues. Most notably we observed a significant increase in reporting when GDPR came into effect. The most common issue types were feature requests for privacy enhancement, which were mainly reported and discussed by frequent reporters and frequent committers. But especially issues regarding privacy enhancement were also frequently reported by one-time reporters. Most of the requests were solved without opposing votes. All in all, our findings indicate that data protection regulations effectively start discussions about privacy within the software development community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |
| **[Can ChatGPT support software verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |

Existing concolic execution engines are significantly restricted by (1) input structure-agnostic path constraint selection, leading to the waste of testing effort or missing coverage; (2) limited constraint-solving capability, yielding many syntactically invalid test inputs; (3) reliance on manual acquisition of highly structured seed inputs, resulting in non-continuous testing. This paper proposes Cottontail, a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven concolic execution engine, to mitigate the above limitations. A more complete program path representation, named Expressive Structural Coverage Tree (ESCT), is first constructed to select structure-aware path constraints. Later, an LLM-driven constraint solver based on a Solve-Complete paradigm is designed to solve the path constraints smartly to get test inputs that are not only satisfiable to the constraints but also valid to the input syntax. Finally, a history-guided seed acquisition is employed to obtain new highly structured test inputs either before testing starts or after testing is saturated. We implemented Cottontail on top of SymCC and evaluated eight extensively tested open-source libraries across four different formats (XML, SQL, JavaScript, and JSON). Cottontail significantly outperforms baseline approaches by 30.73% and 41.32% on average in terms of line and branch coverage. Besides, Cottontail found six previously unknown vulnerabilities (six CVEs assigned). We have reported these issues to developers, and four out of them have been fixed so far.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on the 2026 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (22 pages, with detailed Appendix)</p></details> |

| **[Beyond Postconditions: Can Large Language Models infer Formal Contracts for Automatic Software Verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12702v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software verifiers have become increasingly effective at the task of checking software against (formal) specifications. Yet, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to be false alarms. To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software verifiers to catch real-world bugs.</p></details> | under submission |
| **[On the Robustness Evaluation of 3D Obstacle Detection Against Specifications in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13653v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) rely on real-time sensor data, such as cameras and LiDARs, for time-critical decisions using deep neural networks. The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

Prior literature focused on how data protection regulations are discussed for software in operation, or how this topic is discussed in various channels outside of the software development process. Yet, what is missing, is a perspective on the impact of such regulations on the software development process. In our work, we address this gap, and explore how discussions during the development of software are impacted by regulations, who reports and discusses issues related to personal data and data protection, and how developers react to those issues. To that end, we used inductive coding to analyze 652 issues from Open Source GitHub projects and used the codes to quantitatively analyze the relation between the roles, resolutions, and data protection issues to understand correlations and predict resolutions of issues. Most notably we observed a significant increase in reporting when GDPR came into effect. The most common issue types were feature requests for privacy enhancement, which were mainly reported and discussed by frequent reporters and frequent committers. But especially issues regarding privacy enhancement were also frequently reported by one-time reporters. Most of the requests were solved without opposing votes. All in all, our findings indicate that data protection regulations effectively start discussions about privacy within the software development community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |

Despite growing interest, the literature lacks a cohesive synthesis of runtime composition in dynamic SoSs. Objective: This study synthesizes research on runtime composition in dynamic SoSs and identifies core challenges, solution strategies, supporting tools, and evaluation methods. Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and selecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges fall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system orchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs. Solutions span seven areas: co-simulation and digital twins, semantic ontologies, integration frameworks, adaptive architectures, middleware, formal methods, and AI-driven resilience. Service-oriented frameworks for composition and integration dominate tooling, while simulation platforms support evaluation. Interoperability across tools, limited cross-toolchain workflows, and the absence of standardized benchmarks remain key gaps. Evaluation approaches include simulation-based, implementation-driven, and human-centered studies, which have been applied in domains such as smart cities, healthcare, defense, and industrial automation. Conclusions: The synthesis reveals tensions, including autonomy versus coordination, the modeling-reality gap, and socio-technical integration. It calls for standardized evaluation metrics, scalable decentralized architectures, and cross-domain frameworks. The analysis aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing dynamically composable SoSs.</p></details> |  |
