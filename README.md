A major problem is that prior accessibility solutions have relied on modifications to the Blockly library, making them difficult to apply in existing BBPEs and thereby limiting adoption. We present an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF) to make BBPEs accessible for BVI students. The framework uses a modular architecture that enables seamless integration with existing Blockly-based BBPEs. We present an innovative three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical navigation model featuring stack labeling and block numbering, mode-based editing to prevent accidental modifications, and WAI-ARIA implementation to ensure compatibility with external screen readers. We evaluated our approach by integrating the EAF framework into two BBPEs (covering 177 test cases) and conducting semi-structured interviews with four participants using VoiceOver, JAWS, and NVDA. Participants reported clearer spatial orientation and easier mental model formation compared to default Blockly keyboard navigation. EAF shows that modular architecture can provide comprehensive accessibility while ensuring compatibility with existing BBPEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st International Workshop on User Interface and Experience for Software Engineering (UISE 2026), co-located with ICSE 2026.

Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>MSR 2...</summary><p>MSR 2026 Technical Track</p></details> |

We evaluated our approach by integrating the EAF framework into two BBPEs (covering 177 test cases) and conducting semi-structured interviews with four participants using VoiceOver, JAWS, and NVDA. Participants reported clearer spatial orientation and easier mental model formation compared to default Blockly keyboard navigation. EAF shows that modular architecture can provide comprehensive accessibility while ensuring compatibility with existing BBPEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st International Workshop on User Interface and Experience for Software Engineering (UISE 2026), co-located with ICSE 2026.

Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>MSR 2...</summary><p>MSR 2026 Technical Track</p></details> |

A major problem is that prior accessibility solutions have relied on modifications to the Blockly library, making them difficult to apply in existing BBPEs and thereby limiting adoption. We present an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF) to make BBPEs accessible for BVI students. The framework uses a modular architecture that enables seamless integration with existing Blockly-based BBPEs. We present an innovative three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical navigation model featuring stack labeling and block numbering, mode-based editing to prevent accidental modifications, and WAI-ARIA implementation to ensure compatibility with external screen readers. We evaluated our approach by integrating the EAF framework into two BBPEs (covering 177 test cases) and conducting semi-structured interviews with four participants using VoiceOver, JAWS, and NVDA. Participants reported clearer spatial orientation and easier mental model formation compared to default Blockly keyboard navigation.
