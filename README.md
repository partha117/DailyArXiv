| **[3D Software Synthesis Guided by Constraint-Expressive Intermediate Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18625v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |

| **[OpenCAMS: An Open-Source Connected and Automated Mobility Co-Simulation Platform for Advancing Next-Generation Intelligent Transportation Systems Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09186v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OpenCAMS (Open-Source Connected and Automated Mobility Co-Simulation Platform), an open-source, synchronized, and extensible co-simulation framework that tightly couples three best-in-class simulation tools: (i) SUMO, (ii) CARLA, and (iii) OMNeT++. OpenCAMS is designed to support advanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by combining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides large-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D perception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables modular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized, bidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation progression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while preserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and render a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control logic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and traffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to both mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside units) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the foundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and future-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this core without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture. The OpenCAMS platform is fully open-source and publicly available through its GitHub repository https://github.com/minhaj6/carla-sumo-omnetpp-cosim, providing the research community with an accessible, flexible, and collaborative environment for advancing next-generation intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are AI-Generated Fixes Secure? Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Structure and Semantics of Identifier Names Containing Closed Syntactic Category Words](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18444v4)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifier names are crucial components of code, serving as primary clues for developers to understand program behavior. This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code Completion: Experience on WeChat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18515v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval. Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths. Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of RAG methods in real-world development environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICSME 25 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[It is Giving Major Satisfaction: Why Fairness Matters for Software Practitioners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02482v5)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software practitioners often encounter workplace unfairness, such as unequal recognition and gender bias. While the link between fairness and job satisfaction has been established in other fields, its relevance to software professionals remains underexplored. This study examines how fairness perceptions relate to job satisfaction among software practitioners, focusing on both general trends and demographic-specific differences. We conducted an online survey of 108 software practitioners, followed by ordinal logistic regression to analyze the relationship between fairness perceptions and job satisfaction in software engineering contexts, with moderation analysis examining how this relationship varies across demographic groups. Our findings indicate that all four fairness dimensions (namely distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational fairness) significantly affect overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with job security. Among these, interpersonal fairness has the biggest impact. The relationship between fairness and job satisfaction is stronger for female, ethnically underrepresented, less experienced practitioners, and those with work limitations. Fairness in authorship emerged as an important factor for job satisfaction collectively, while fairness in policy implementation, high-demand situations, and working hours impacted specific demographic groups. This study highlights the role of fairness among software practitioners, offering strategies for organizations to promote fair practices and targeted approaches for certain demographic groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |
| **[FMI Meets SystemC: A Framework for Cross-Tool Virtual Prototyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18339v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools. The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation environments. This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus, extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available, certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the 16th International Modelica and FMI Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLMShot: Reducing snapshot testing maintenance via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10062v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot testing has emerged as a critical technique for UI validation in modern software development, yet it suffers from substantial maintenance overhead due to frequent UI changes causing test failures that require manual inspection to distinguish between genuine regressions and intentional design changes. This manual triage process becomes increasingly burdensome as applications evolve, creating a need for automated analysis solutions. This paper introduces LLMShot, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically analyze snapshot test failures through semantic classification of UI changes. To evaluate LLMShot's effectiveness, we developed a comprehensive dataset using a feature-rich iOS application with configurable feature flags, creating realistic scenarios that produce authentic snapshot differences representative of real development workflows. Our evaluation using Gemma3 models demonstrates strong classification performance, with the 12B variant achieving over 84% recall in identifying failure root causes while the 4B model offers practical deployment advantages with acceptable performance for continuous integration environments. However, our exploration of selective ignore mechanisms revealed significant limitations in current prompting-based approaches for controllable visual reasoning. LLMShot represents the first automated approach to semantic snapshot test analysis, offering developers structured insights that can substantially reduce manual triage effort and advance toward more intelligent UI testing paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Gotta catch 'em all! Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without any specific selection. In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches. Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases known in the bug localisation community on our dataset. Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally, we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[YATE: The Role of Test Repair in LLM-Based Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18316v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code. YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20% more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Scheduzz: Constraint-based Fuzz Driver Generation with Dual Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18289v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However, they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and generating false positive bug reports. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop, multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or suspension. We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and 1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer, Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition, Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries, 3 of which have been assigned CVEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study on Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robot (EAIR) Software Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18267v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs. To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15 distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards. Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction, detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.</p></details> |  |

| **[CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs) in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding the Challenges of Bug Localization in Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01021v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bugs cost the global economy billions of dollars annually and claim ~50\% of the programming time from software developers. Locating these bugs is crucial for their resolution but challenging. It is even more challenging in deep-learning systems due to their black-box nature. Bugs in these systems are also hidden not only in the code but also in the models and training data, which might make traditional debugging methods less effective. In this article, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the challenges of localizing bugs in deep-learning systems. First, we determine the bug localization performance of four existing techniques using 2,365 bugs from deep-learning systems and 2,913 from traditional software. We found these techniques significantly underperform in localizing deep-learning system bugs. Second, we evaluate how different bug types in deep learning systems impact bug localization. We found that the effectiveness of localization techniques varies with bug type due to their unique challenges. For example, tensor bugs were more accessible to locate due to their structural nature, while all techniques struggled with GPU bugs due to their external dependencies. Third, we investigate the impact of bugs' extrinsic nature on localization in deep-learning systems. We found that deep learning bugs are often extrinsic and thus connected to artifacts other than source code (e.g., GPU, training data), contributing to the poor performance of existing localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Empirical Software Engineering Journal in 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

However, no similar studies have been conducted for computational notebooks in the context of data science. To help bridge this research gap, we make three scientific contributions: we (1) introduce a toolset for collecting code changes in Jupyter notebooks during development time; (2) use it to collect more than 100 hours of work related to a data analysis task and a machine learning task (carried out by 20 developers with different levels of expertise), resulting in a dataset containing 2,655 cells and 9,207 cell executions; and (3) use this dataset to investigate the dynamic nature of the notebook development process and the changes that take place in the notebooks. In our analysis of the collected data, we classified the changes made to the cells between executions and found that a significant number of these changes were relatively small fixes and code iteration modifications. This suggests that notebooks are used not only as a development and exploration tool but also as a debugging tool. We report a number of other insights and propose potential future research directions on the novel data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02274v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Comprehension Benchmark for Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10641v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks. The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability. Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 5 Figures |

We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits. Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code, supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain. Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts, simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models, demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables, IEEE Conference format, Q4 2025 model release, Q1 2026 Kodezi OS deployment</p></details> |

This paper documents the design, implementation, and iterative debugging of a novel, serverless system for real-time stock analysis. The system leverages the Gemini API for qualitative assessment, automates data ingestion and processing via GitHub Actions, and presents the findings through a decoupled, static frontend. We detail the architectural evolution of the system, from initial concepts to a robust, event-driven pipeline, highlighting the practical challenges encountered during deployment. A significant portion of this paper is dedicated to a case study on the debugging process, covering common software errors, platform-specific permission issues, and rare, environment-level platform bugs. The final architecture operates at a near-zero cost, demonstrating a viable model for individuals to build sophisticated AI-powered financial tools.

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool for Supporting Debugging and Understanding of Normative Requirements Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05504v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal verification offers strong assurances of software correctness. However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge graphs, our approach aims to reduce hallucinations and increase the factual accuracy of generated responses. The system provides an interactive experience similar to ChatGPT, tailored specifically for ReservoirPy, enabling users to write, debug, and understand Python code while accessing reliable domain-specific insights. In our evaluation, while proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o and NotebookLM performed slightly better on general knowledge questions, our model outperformed them on coding tasks and showed a significant improvement over its base model, Codestral-22B.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03156v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice.

However, traditional testing approaches involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities, providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Deduplicating Compiler Bugs with Bisection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It allows verifying that the students correctly apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students' misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g., no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to configure. To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CompEd'25, 7 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks, establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |

Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors.

| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |

As quantum computing transitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present in classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited observability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific tools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software developers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews focused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants reported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing (54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31% reported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual methods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies, such as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which respondents noted do not scale well. The most frequently cited sources of bugs were classical in nature-library updates (81%), developer mistakes (68%), and compatibility issues (62%)-often worsened by limited abstraction in existing SDKs. These findings highlight the urgent need for better-aligned testing and debugging tools, integrated more seamlessly into the workflows of quantum developers. We present these results in detail and offer actionable recommendations grounded in the real-world needs of practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[MLDebugging: Towards Benchmarking Code Debugging Across Multi-Library Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13824v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code debugging is a crucial task in software engineering, which attracts increasing attention. While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios. We hope this work can uncover the potential of LLMs in multi-library debugging scenario and offer insights for future research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Hessian-Based Insights Support Fault Diagnosis in Attention-based Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07871v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity, diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis) and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRepair: An Exploratory Study on Merging Task-Specific Adapters in Code LLMs for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09568v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown high capabilities in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, 34% of reported issues are quantum-specific, highlighting the need for specialized debugging tools beyond conventional software engineering approaches. This study provides empirical insights into the software engineering challenges of quantum computing, offering recommendations to improve development workflows, tooling, and documentation. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Identify Flakiness in C++ Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12340v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of regression testing in software testing is crucial as it ensures that any new modifications do not disrupt the existing functionality and behaviour of the software system. The desired outcome is for regression tests to yield identical results without any modifications made to the system being tested. In practice, however, the presence of Flaky Tests introduces non-deterministic behaviour and undermines the reliability of regression testing results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for identifying the root cause of flaky tests in C++ projects at the code level, with the intention of assisting developers in debugging and resolving them more efficiently. We compile a comprehensive collection of C++ project flaky tests sourced from GitHub repositories. We fine-tune Mistral-7b, Llama2-7b and CodeLlama-7b models on the C++ dataset and an existing Java dataset and evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We assess the performance of the models across various datasets and offer recommendations for both research and industry applications. The results indicate that our models exhibit varying performance on the C++ dataset, while their performance is comparable to that of the Java dataset. The Mistral-7b surpasses the other two models regarding all metrics, achieving a score of 1. Our results demonstrate the exceptional capability of LLMs to accurately classify flakiness in C++ and Java projects, providing a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of debugging flaky tests in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM-Based Fault Localization with External Memory and Project Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03585v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 7 figures |

However, existing debuggers are primarily tailored for human interaction, and those designed for programmatic debugging focus on kernel space, resulting in limited functionality in userland. To fill this gap, we introduce libdebug, a Python library for programmatic debugging of userland binary executables. libdebug offers a user-friendly API that enables developers to build custom debugging tools for various applications, including software engineering, reverse engineering, and software security. It is released as an open-source project, along with comprehensive documentation to encourage use and collaboration across the community. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of libdebug through case studies and benchmarks, all of which are publicly available. We find that the median latency of syscall and breakpoint handling in libdebug is 3 to 4 times lower compared to that of GDB.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |

LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

This work introduces JITScope, an interactive visualization framework that illustrates how IR nodes and instructions evolve across compilation phases. The system features a full-stack architecture: a Python-based backend transforms raw JSON-formatted IR data-representing an abstract model of the JIT compiler IR-into a normalized SQLite database; a controller layer serves processed CSV data; and a D3.js-powered frontend renders an interactive, phase-aware graph of IR node transformations. The design emphasizes modularity, traceability, and flexibility. Our roadmap explores intuitive visual representations of phase-level changes in IR node connectivity, values, and access patterns. Ultimately, JITScope lays a foundation for future tooling that enables visual exploration of IR evolution, including phase filtering, value tracking, and function-access mapping-offering a new lens into the behaviors and impacts of compiler optimizations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 8 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

The chapter considers a debugging process in which a program is tested against different test cases. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test case. The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software, GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a unique corresponding event handler.</p></details> |  |

Virtual Platforms (VPs) have become indispensable tools for this purpose as they serve as a platform to execute and debug the unmodified target software at an early design stage. With the increasing complexity of software, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, VPs need to provide high simulation speed to ensure the target software executes within a reasonable time. Hybrid simulation, which combines virtual models with real hardware, can improve the performance of VPs. This paper introduces a novel approach for integrating real Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices into SystemC-TLM-2.0-based VPs. The embedded PCI devices enable high performance, easy integration, and allow introspection for analysis and optimization. To illustrate the practical application of our approach, we present a case study where we integrate Google Coral's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) into an ARM-based VP. The integration allows efficient execution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while eliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating AI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression testing across architectures, and device communication analysis. Our findings demonstrate that embedding PCI devices into SystemC simulations significantly enhances</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the 25th International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation (SAMOS XXV)</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Mutation-based Fault Localization for Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09059v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to execute operations. They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |

Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without any specific selection. In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches. Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases known in the bug localisation community on our dataset. Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally, we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Therefore, many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However, they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and generating false positive bug reports. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop, multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or suspension. We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and 1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer, Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition, Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries, 3 of which have been assigned CVEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Ensuring their program correctness is fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs. To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15 distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards. Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction, detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.</p></details> |  |

Our framework is powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our orchestration engine intelligently selects among three complementary circuit optimizers: A DRL-based circuit rewriter trained to reduce depth and gate count via learned rewrite sequences; a domain-specific optimizer that performs efficient local gate resynthesis and numeric optimization; a parameterized circuit instantiator that improves compilation by optimizing template circuits during gate set translation. These modules are coordinated by a central orchestration engine that learns coordination policies based on circuit structure, hardware constraints, and backend-aware performance features such as gate count, depth, and expected fidelity. The system outputs an optimized circuit for hardware-aware transpilation and execution, leveraging techniques from an existing state-of-the-art approach, called the NISQ Analyzer, to adapt to backend constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025 - Extended Abstract</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding the Challenges of Bug Localization in Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01021v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bugs cost the global economy billions of dollars annually and claim ~50\% of the programming time from software developers. Locating these bugs is crucial for their resolution but challenging. It is even more challenging in deep-learning systems due to their black-box nature. Bugs in these systems are also hidden not only in the code but also in the models and training data, which might make traditional debugging methods less effective. In this article, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the challenges of localizing bugs in deep-learning systems. First, we determine the bug localization performance of four existing techniques using 2,365 bugs from deep-learning systems and 2,913 from traditional software. We found these techniques significantly underperform in localizing deep-learning system bugs. Second, we evaluate how different bug types in deep learning systems impact bug localization. We found that the effectiveness of localization techniques varies with bug type due to their unique challenges. For example, tensor bugs were more accessible to locate due to their structural nature, while all techniques struggled with GPU bugs due to their external dependencies. Third, we investigate the impact of bugs' extrinsic nature on localization in deep-learning systems. We found that deep learning bugs are often extrinsic and thus connected to artifacts other than source code (e.g., GPU, training data), contributing to the poor performance of existing localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Empirical Software Engineering Journal in 2025</p></details> |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[BandFuzz: An ML-powered Collaborative Fuzzing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10845v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative fuzzing combines multiple individual fuzzers and dynamically chooses appropriate combinations for different programs. Unlike individual fuzzers that rely on specific assumptions, collaborative fuzzing relaxes assumptions on target programs, providing robust performance across various programs. However, existing collaborative fuzzing frameworks face challenges including additional computational resource requirements and inefficient resource allocation among fuzzers. To tackle these challenges, we present BANDFUZZ, an ML-powered collaborative fuzzing framework that outperforms individual fuzzers without requiring additional computational resources. The key contribution of BANDFUZZ lies in its novel resource allocation algorithm driven by our proposed multi-armed bandits model. Different from greedy methods in existing frameworks, BANDFUZZ models the long-term impact of individual fuzzers, enabling discovery of globally optimal collaborative strategies. We propose a novel fuzzer evaluation method that assesses not only code coverage but also the fuzzer's capability of solving difficult branches. Finally, we integrate a real-time seed synchronization mechanism and implementation-wise optimizations to improve fuzzing efficiency and stability. Through extensive experiments on Fuzzbench and Fuzzer Test Suite, we show that BANDFUZZ outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative fuzzing framework autofz and widely used individual fuzzers. We verify BANDFUZZ's key designs through comprehensive ablation study. Notably, we demonstrate BANDFUZZ's effectiveness in real-world bug detection by analyzing results of a worldwide fuzzing competition, where BANDFUZZ won first place.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |

| **[Are AI-Generated Fixes Secure? Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</p></details> |

We assess how integrating BP with tools such as Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers, symbolic and probabilistic model checking, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) allow us to scale the abilities of BP to model complex systems. Additionally, we illustrate how developers can leverage multiple tools within a single modeling and development task.

While effective, language models tend to generate many incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code. YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20% more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and qualitative developer studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)</p></details> |

It enables teams to develop, test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services, GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions. Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity, heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regis...</summary><p>Registered Report Accepted at the 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025 (ICSME'25)</p></details> |

Although the literature outlines various methods to identify potential design and coding issues in object-oriented programming through source code analysis, such as code smells and SOLID principles, few studies explore how these code-level issues relate to learning difficulties in Object-Oriented Programming. In this study, we explore the relationship of the code issue indicators with common challenges encountered during the learning of object-oriented programming. Using qualitative analysis, we identified the main categories of learning difficulties and, through a literature review, established connections between these difficulties, code smells, and violations of the SOLID principles. As a result, we developed a conceptual map that links code-related issues to specific learning challenges in Object-Oriented Programming. The model was then evaluated by an expert who applied it in the analysis of the student code to assess its relevance and applicability in educational contexts.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces CASCADE, a novel hybrid approach that integrates the advanced coding capabilities of Gemini with the deterministic transformation capabilities of a compiler Intermediate Representation (IR), specifically JavaScript IR (JSIR). By employing Gemini to identify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the most prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code transformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original strings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method overcomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques, eliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving reliability and flexibility. CASCADE is already deployed in Google's production environment, demonstrating substantial improvements in JavaScript deobfuscation efficiency and reducing reverse engineering efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to Model Context Protocol Servers for Tool-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16044v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate. This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling. We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success. Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.</p></details> |  |

It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Neural Network Verification via Order Leading Exploration of Branch-and-Bound Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17453v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial perturbations has necessitated formal verification techniques that can rigorously certify the quality of neural networks. As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is a "divide-and-conquer" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these sub-problems in a naive "first-come-first-serve" manner, thereby suffering from an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB, concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples. Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including $Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5 models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up to 80X in CIFAR10.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the ECOOP 2025 paper, with a comparison with DATE 2025 (Figure 7 of RQ1 in Section 5.2), as well as an in-depth discussion of OOPSLA 2025 in the related work (Section 6)</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Training Data Detection in AI Coders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17389v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in code large language models (CodeLLMs) have made them indispensable tools in modern software engineering. However, these models occasionally produce outputs that contain proprietary or sensitive code snippets, raising concerns about potential non-compliant use of training data, and posing risks to privacy and intellectual property. To ensure responsible and compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become a critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural language settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely underexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured syntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven state-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance across eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a function-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three programming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded from CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design targeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three distinct settings. These mutation strategies are grounded in the well-established Type-1 to Type-4 code clone detection taxonomy. Our study provides a systematic assessment of current TDD techniques for code and offers insights to guide the development of more effective and robust detection methods in the future.</p></details> |  |

Code smells, which are recurring anomalies in design or style, have been extensively researched in professional code. However, their significance in block-based projects created by novices is still largely unknown. Block-based environments such as Scratch offer a unique, data-rich setting to examine how emergent design problems intersect with the cultivation of computational-thinking (CT) skills. Objective. This research explores the connection between CT proficiency and design-level code smells--issues that may hinder software maintenance and evolution--in programs created by Scratch developers. We seek to identify which CT dimensions align most strongly with which code smells and whether task context moderates those associations. Method. A random sample of aprox. 2 million public Scratch projects is mined. Using open-source linters, we extract nine CT scores and 40 code smell indicators from these projects. After rigorous pre-processing, we apply descriptive analytics, robust correlation tests, stratified cross-validation, and exploratory machine-learning models; qualitative spot-checks contextualize quantitative patterns. Impact. The study will deliver the first large-scale, fine-grained map linking specific CT competencies to concrete design flaws and antipatterns. Results are poised to (i) inform evidence-based curricula and automated feedback systems, (ii) provide effect-size benchmarks for future educational interventions, and (iii) supply an open, pseudonymized dataset and reproducible analysis pipeline for the research community. By clarifying how programming habits influence early skill acquisition, the work advances both computing-education theory and practical tooling for sustainable software maintenance and evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regis...</summary><p>Registered Report accepted at ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Prompt Programming Tasks and Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17264v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting foundation models (FMs) like large language models (LLMs) have enabled new AI-powered software features (e.g., text summarization) that previously were only possible by fine-tuning FMs. Now, developers are embedding prompts in software, known as prompt programs. The process of prompt programming requires the developer to make many changes to their prompt. Yet, the questions developers ask to update their prompt is unknown, despite the answers to these questions affecting how developers plan their changes. With the growing number of research and commercial prompt programming tools, it is unclear whether prompt programmers' needs are being adequately addressed. We address these challenges by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks prompt programmers do and 51 questions they ask, measuring the importance of each task and question. We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make prompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48 research and commercial tools. We find that prompt programming is not well-supported: all tasks are done manually, and 16 of the 51 questions -- including a majority of the most important ones -- remain unanswered. Based on this, we outline important opportunities for prompt programming tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Reliability of Statistical Maximum Coverage Estimators in Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17093v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Fuzzers are often guided by coverage, making the estimation of maximum achievable coverage a key concern in fuzzing. However, achieving 100% coverage is infeasible for most real-world software systems, regardless of effort. While static reachability analysis can provide an upper bound, it is often highly inaccurate. Recently, statistical estimation methods based on species richness estimators from biostatistics have been proposed as a potential solution. Yet, the lack of reliable benchmarks with labeled ground truth has limited rigorous evaluation of their accuracy. Objective: This work examines the reliability of reachability estimators from two axes: addressing the lack of labeled ground truth and evaluating their reliability on real-world programs. Methods: (1) To address the challenge of labeled ground truth, we propose an evaluation framework that synthetically generates large programs with complex control flows, ensuring well-defined reachability and providing ground truth for evaluation. (2) To address the criticism from use of synthetic benchmarks, we adapt a reliability check for reachability estimators on real-world benchmarks without labeled ground truth -- by varying the size of sampling units, which, in theory, should not affect the estimate. Results: These two studies together will help answer the question of whether current reachability estimators are reliable, and defines a protocol to evaluate future improvements in reachability estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICSME...</summary><p>ICSME'25 Registered Report</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding the Challenges of Bug Localization in Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01021v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bugs cost the global economy billions of dollars annually and claim ~50\% of the programming time from software developers. Locating these bugs is crucial for their resolution but challenging. It is even more challenging in deep-learning systems due to their black-box nature. Bugs in these systems are also hidden not only in the code but also in the models and training data, which might make traditional debugging methods less effective. In this article, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the challenges of localizing bugs in deep-learning systems. First, we determine the bug localization performance of four existing techniques using 2,365 bugs from deep-learning systems and 2,913 from traditional software. We found these techniques significantly underperform in localizing deep-learning system bugs. Second, we evaluate how different bug types in deep learning systems impact bug localization. We found that the effectiveness of localization techniques varies with bug type due to their unique challenges. For example, tensor bugs were more accessible to locate due to their structural nature, while all techniques struggled with GPU bugs due to their external dependencies. Third, we investigate the impact of bugs' extrinsic nature on localization in deep-learning systems. We found that deep learning bugs are often extrinsic and thus connected to artifacts other than source code (e.g., GPU, training data), contributing to the poor performance of existing localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Empirical Software Engineering Journal in 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents a new database system supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is intended to improve the management of data using natural language processing (NLP) - based intuitive interfaces, and automatic creation of structured queries and semi-structured data formats like yet another markup language (YAML), java script object notation (JSON), and application program interface (API) documentation. The system is intended to strengthen the potential of databases through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is purposed to allow the automation of fundamental tasks such as data modeling, schema creation, query comprehension, and performance optimization. We present in this paper a system that aims to alleviate the main problems with current database technologies. It is meant to reduce the need for technical skills, manual tuning for better performance, and the potential for human error. The AI database employs generative schema inference and format selection to build its schema models and execution formats.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, appears in EDULEARN25 Conference Proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Explainable Vulnerability Detection in C/C++ Using Edge-Aware Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16540v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting security vulnerabilities in source code remains challenging, particularly due to class imbalance in real-world datasets where vulnerable functions are under-represented. Existing learning-based methods often optimise for recall, leading to high false positive rates and reduced usability in development workflows. Furthermore, many approaches lack explainability, limiting their integration into security workflows. This paper presents ExplainVulD, a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code. The method constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information. These are processed by an edge-aware attention mechanism that incorporates edge-type embeddings to distinguish among program relations. To address class imbalance, the model is trained using class-weighted cross-entropy loss. ExplainVulD achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23 percent across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset. These results represent relative improvements of 4.6 percent in accuracy and 16.9 percent in F1 score compared to the ReVeal model, a prior learning-based method. The framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0 to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by identifying the most influential code regions within each function, supporting transparency and trust in security triage.</p></details> |  |

| **[ACT: Bridging the Gap in Code Translation through Synthetic Data Generation & Adaptive Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16478v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models, narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity. ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in developer acceleration.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has examined the impact of identifier names on program comprehension in traditional programming environments, limited work has explored this area in scientific software, especially regarding the quality of method names in the code. The recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for automating code analysis tasks, such as identifier name appraisals and recommendations. Our study evaluates four popular LLMs on their ability to analyze grammatical patterns and suggest improvements for 496 method names extracted from Python-based Jupyter Notebooks. Our findings show that the LLMs are somewhat effective in analyzing these method names and generally follow good naming practices, like starting method names with verbs. However, their inconsistent handling of domain-specific terminology and only moderate agreement with human annotations indicate that automated suggestions require human evaluation. This work provides foundational insights for improving the quality of scientific code through AI automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement - Emerging Results and Vision Track</p></details> |

However, developers frequently produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based, have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG), enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks.</p></details> |  |

While existing code evolution benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To address this, we introduce GitChameleon 2.0, a novel, meticulously curated dataset comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon 2.0 rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51% range, underscoring the intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon 2.0 enables a clearer understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and evaluation code publicly available at https://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2 of the dataset from: arXiv:2411.05830</p></details> |
| **[RightTyper: Effective and Efficient Type Annotation for Python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16051v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Python type annotations bring the benefits of static type checking to the language. However, manually writing annotations can be time-consuming and tedious. The result is that most real-world Python code remains largely untyped. Past approaches to annotating types in Python code fall short in a number of ways. Static approaches struggle with dynamic features and infer overly broad types. AI-based methods are inherently unsound and can miss rare or user-defined types. Dynamic methods can impose extreme runtime overheads, degrading performance by up to 270x, abort execution as they exhaust resources, and even infer incorrect types that lead to runtime errors. Crucially, all prior work assumes implicitly that the code to be annotated is already correct. This assumption is generally unwarranted, especially for large codebases that have been untyped. This paper presents RightTyper, a novel approach for Python that overcomes these disadvantages. RightTyper not only generates precise type annotations based on actual program behavior, improving recall in type checking relative to prior approaches. It also turns type checking into anomaly detection, allowing the type checker to identify corner cases that the programmer can audit for unintended behavior. RightTyper is also fast and space-efficient, imposing just 30% performance overhead on average. RightTyper achieves these characteristics by a principled yet pervasive use of sampling--guided by self-profiling--along with statistical filtering and careful resolution and aggregation of type information.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Pilot Study on LLM-Based Agentic Translation from Android to iOS: Pitfalls and Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16037v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of mobile applications has led to a significant demand for cross-platform compatibility, particularly between the Android and iOS platforms. Traditional approaches to mobile application translation often rely on manual intervention or rule-based systems, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. While recent advancements in machine learning have introduced automated methods, they often lack contextual understanding and adaptability, resulting in suboptimal translations. Large Language Models (LLMs) were recently leveraged to enhance code translation at different granularities, including the method, class, and repository levels. Researchers have investigated common errors, limitations, and potential strategies to improve these tasks. However, LLM-based application translation across different platforms, such as migrating mobile applications between Android and iOS or adapting software across diverse frameworks, remains underexplored. Understanding the performance, strengths, and limitations of LLMs in cross-platform application translation is critical for advancing software engineering automation. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating LLM-based agentic approaches for mobile application translation, identifying key failure points, and proposing guidelines to improve translation performance. We developed a chain of agents that account for dependencies, specifications, program structure, and program control flow when translating applications from Android to iOS. To evaluate the performance, we manually examined the translated code for syntactic correctness, semantic accuracy, and functional completeness. For translation failures, we further conducted a detailed root cause analysis to understand the underlying limitations of the agentic translation process and identify opportunities for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[BandFuzz: An ML-powered Collaborative Fuzzing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10845v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative fuzzing combines multiple individual fuzzers and dynamically chooses appropriate combinations for different programs. Unlike individual fuzzers that rely on specific assumptions, collaborative fuzzing relaxes assumptions on target programs, providing robust performance across various programs. However, existing collaborative fuzzing frameworks face challenges including additional computational resource requirements and inefficient resource allocation among fuzzers. To tackle these challenges, we present BANDFUZZ, an ML-powered collaborative fuzzing framework that outperforms individual fuzzers without requiring additional computational resources. The key contribution of BANDFUZZ lies in its novel resource allocation algorithm driven by our proposed multi-armed bandits model. Different from greedy methods in existing frameworks, BANDFUZZ models the long-term impact of individual fuzzers, enabling discovery of globally optimal collaborative strategies. We propose a novel fuzzer evaluation method that assesses not only code coverage but also the fuzzer's capability of solving difficult branches. Finally, we integrate a real-time seed synchronization mechanism and implementation-wise optimizations to improve fuzzing efficiency and stability. Through extensive experiments on Fuzzbench and Fuzzer Test Suite, we show that BANDFUZZ outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative fuzzing framework autofz and widely used individual fuzzers. We verify BANDFUZZ's key designs through comprehensive ablation study. Notably, we demonstrate BANDFUZZ's effectiveness in real-world bug detection by analyzing results of a worldwide fuzzing competition, where BANDFUZZ won first place.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[BugScope: Learn to Find Bugs Like Human](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15671v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting software bugs remains a fundamental challenge due to the extensive diversity of real-world defects. Traditional static analysis tools often rely on symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to customized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue to struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited analysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug patterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code auditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy behaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant detection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection prompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score. Further testing on large-scale open-source systems, including the Linux kernel, uncovered 141 previously unknown bugs, of which 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed by developers, highlighting BugScope's substantial practical impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |

Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of LLMs' Preferences for Libraries and Programming Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17181v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, influencing users' choices of libraries and programming languages in critical real-world projects. However, little is known about their systematic biases or preferences toward certain libraries and programming languages, which can significantly impact software development practices. To fill this gap, we perform the first empirical study of LLMs' preferences for libraries and programming languages when generating code, covering eight diverse LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to overuse widely adopted libraries such as NumPy; in up to 48% of cases, this usage is unnecessary and deviates from the ground-truth solutions. LLMs also exhibit a significant preference toward Python as their default language. For high-performance project initialisation tasks where Python is not the optimal language, it remains the dominant choice in 58% of cases, and Rust is not used a single time. These results indicate that LLMs may prioritise familiarity and popularity over suitability and task-specific optimality. This will introduce security vulnerabilities and technical debt, and limit exposure to newly developed, better-suited tools and languages. Understanding and addressing these biases is essential for the responsible integration of LLMs into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures.

| **[Input Reduction Enhanced LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15251v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program Repair (APR). Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of failures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR. Unfortunately, LLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts. When the test inputs are extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, compromising repair performance. To address this, we propose ReduceFix, an LLM-based APR approach with a built-in component that automatically reduces test inputs while retaining their failure-inducing behavior. ReduceFix prompts an LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs without human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to guide patch generation. For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB. On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair increases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes. Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACFIX: Guiding LLMs with Mined Common RBAC Practices for Context-Aware Repair of Access Control Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06838v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical. While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined. Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check. To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them. This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Nanyang Technological University</p></details> |
| **[FaultLine: Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation Using LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15241v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the critical threat posed by software security vulnerabilities, reports are often incomplete, lacking the proof-of-vulnerability (PoV) tests needed to validate fixes and prevent regressions. These tests are crucial not only for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging problem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply nested levels of a program. We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully designed reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic program analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software project with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow of an input from an externally accessible API ("source") to the "sink" corresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an input must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along the flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a feedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or dynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming languages. To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100 known vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects. On this dataset, FaultLine is able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct 2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework. Thus, FaultLine represents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art. Our findings suggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents on PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging. We make our code and dataset publicly available in the hope that it will spur further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Clone Detection via an AlphaFold-Inspired Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15226v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection, which aims to identify functionally equivalent code fragments, plays a critical role in software maintenance and vulnerability analysis. Substantial methods have been proposed to detect code clones, but they fall short in capturing code semantics or relying on language-specific analyzers. Inspired by the remarkable success of AlphaFold in predicting three-dimensional protein structures from protein sequences, in this paper, we leverage AlphaFold for code clone detection based on the insight that protein sequences and token sequences share a common linear sequential structure. In particular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token sequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's sequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline of AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code fragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA from lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified attention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and across token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure prediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences through a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to determine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three language-diverse datasets demonstrate AlphaCC's applicability across multiple programming languages. On two semantic clone detection datasets, it consistently outperforms all baselines, showing strong semantic understanding. Moreover, AlphaCC maintains competitive efficiency, enabling practical usage in large-scale clone detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between coding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of mainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive capabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the challenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. However, existing code-generation benchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in generating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose SimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic code generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five representative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86 Advanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM Scalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a systematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18 representative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful findings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal decrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to scalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions for the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic code generation. SimdBench is fully open source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. STAR supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR exhibits superior effectiveness (10.5%-19.9% improvements) and efficiency (2.4-7.0 times speedup). In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figure, 8 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |

Existing tools detect such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under an open license to support reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[LibLMFuzz: LLM-Augmented Fuzz Target Generation for Black-box Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15058v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental problem in cybersecurity and computer science is determining whether a program is free of bugs and vulnerabilities. Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 2 listings</p></details> |
| **[StaAgent: An Agentic Framework for Testing Static Analyzers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15892v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analyzers play a critical role in identifying bugs early in the software development lifecycle, but their rule implementations are often under-tested and prone to inconsistencies. To address this, we propose StaAgent, an agentic framework that harnesses the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically evaluate static analyzer rules. StaAgent comprises four specialized agents: a Seed Generation Agent that translates bug detection rules into concrete, bug-inducing seed programs; a Code Validation Agent that ensures the correctness of these seeds; a Mutation Generation Agent that produces semantically equivalent mutants; and an Analyzer Evaluation Agent that performs metamorphic testing by comparing the static analyzer's behavior on seeds and their corresponding mutants. By revealing inconsistent behaviors, StaAgent helps uncover flaws in rule implementations. This LLM-driven, multi-agent framework offers a scalable and adaptable solution to improve the reliability of static analyzers. We evaluated StaAgent with five state-of-the-art LLMs (CodeL-lama, DeepSeek, Codestral, Qwen, and GPT-4o) across five widely used static analyzers (SpotBugs, SonarQube, ErrorProne, Infer, and PMD). The experimental results show that our approach can help reveal 64 problematic rules in the latest versions of these five static analyzers (i.e., 28 in SpotBugs, 18 in SonarQube, 6 in ErrorProne, 4 in Infer, and 8 in PMD). In addition, 53 out of the 64 bugs cannot be detected by the SOTA baseline. We have reported all the bugs to developers, with two of them already fixed. Three more have been confirmed by developers, while the rest are awaiting response. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the promise of agentic, LLM-driven data synthesis to advance software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dr. Boot: Bootstrapping Program Synthesis Language Models to Perform Repairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15889v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models for program synthesis are usually trained and evaluated on programming competition datasets (MBPP, APPS). However, these datasets are limited in size and quality, while these language models are extremely data hungry. Additionally, the language models have a misaligned program synthesis process compared to humans. While humans iteratively develop code with the help of a compiler, most program synthesis models currently produce code in one go. To solve these issues, we introduce a bootstrapping algorithm for program synthesis, that supports teaching models how to repair. We show that bootstrapping consistently outperforms regular fine-tuning. Compared to other work, our bootstrapped model performs on par with fine-tuned models that are 68\% larger. Notably, bootstrapping with repairing also improves non-repairing performance compared to regular bootstrapping during inference. However, on our models, repairing during inference is likely inferior to simply sampling the same number of solutions. Furthermore, we find that there are issues with the example test cases in the training portion of the APPS dataset that are valuable to the community, as many repairing and reinforcement learning methods rely on them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis, University of Amsterdam, 2023 (https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=record_54126).

| **[Toward Inclusive AI-Driven Development: Exploring Gender Differences in Code Generation Tool Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14770v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The increasing reliance on Code Generation Tools (CGTs), such as Windsurf and GitHub Copilot, are revamping programming workflows and raising critical questions about fairness and inclusivity. While CGTs offer potential productivity enhancements, their effectiveness across diverse user groups have not been sufficiently investigated. Objectives: We hypothesize that developers' interactions with CGTs vary based on gender, influencing task outcomes and cognitive load, as prior research suggests that gender differences can affect technology use and cognitive processing. Methods: The study will employ a mixed-subjects design with 54 participants, evenly divided by gender for a counterbalanced design. Participants will complete two programming tasks (medium to hard difficulty) with only CGT assistance and then with only internet access. Task orders and conditions will be counterbalanced to mitigate order effects. Data collection will include cognitive load surveys, screen recordings, and task performance metrics such as completion time, code correctness, and CGT interaction behaviors. Statistical analyses will be conducted to identify statistically significant differences in CGT usage. Expected Contributions: Our work can uncover gender differences in CGT interaction and performance among developers. Our findings can inform future CGT designs and help address usability and potential disparities in interaction patterns across diverse user groups. Conclusion: While results are not yet available, our proposal lays the groundwork for advancing fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE) in CGT design. The outcomes are anticipated to contribute to inclusive AI practices and equitable tool development for all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>ESEM ...</summary><p>ESEM 2025 Registered Reports</p></details> |

We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 155 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing LLMs for Document-Guided Fuzzing of OpenCV Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14558v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of computer vision and artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming a broad spectrum of industries by enabling machines to interpret and act upon visual data with high levels of accuracy. As the biggest and by far the most popular open-source computer vision library, OpenCV library provides an extensive suite of programming functions supporting real-time computer vision. Bugs in the OpenCV library can affect the downstream computer vision applications, and it is critical to ensure the reliability of the OpenCV library. This paper introduces VISTAFUZZ, a novel technique for harnessing large language models (LLMs) for document-guided fuzzing of the OpenCV library. VISTAFUZZ utilizes LLMs to parse API documentation and obtain standardized API information. Based on this standardized information, VISTAFUZZ extracts constraints on individual input parameters and dependencies between these. Using these constraints and dependencies, VISTAFUZZ then generates new input values to systematically test each target API. We evaluate the effectiveness of VISTAFUZZ in testing 330 APIs in the OpenCV library, and the results show that VISTAFUZZ detected 17 new bugs, where 10 bugs have been confirmed, and 5 of these have been fixed.</p></details> |  |

Although widely acknowledged, current literature shows fragmented definitions, metrics, and remediation strategies. Our study aims to unify understanding of architectural degradation by identifying its definitions, causes, metrics, tools, and remediation approaches across academic and gray literature. We conducted a multivocal literature review of 108 studies extracting definitions, causes, metrics, measurement approaches, tools, and remediation strategies. We developed a taxonomy encompassing architectural, code, and process debt to explore definition evolution, methodological trends, and research gaps. Architectural degradation has shifted from a low-level issue to a socio-technical concern. Definitions now address code violations, design drift, and structural decay. Causes fall under architectural (e.g., poor documentation), code (e.g., hasty fixes), and process debt (e.g., knowledge loss). We identified 54 metrics and 31 measurement techniques, focused on smells, cohesion/coupling, and evolution. Yet, most tools detect issues but rarely support ongoing or preventive remediation. Degradation is both technical and organizational. While detection is well-studied, continuous remediation remains lacking. Our study reveals missed integration between metrics, tools, and repair logic, urging holistic, proactive strategies for sustainable architecture.</p></details> |  |

We propose an ensemble approach for LLMs in code generation. Instead of relying on the output of a single model, we generate multiple candidate programs from different LLMs and apply a structured voting mechanism to select the most reliable solution. For voting, we compute syntactic and semantic similarity using CodeBLEU and behavioral equivalence using CrossHair's differential behavior analysis. By aggregating these similarity scores, we select the program that best aligns with the consensus among the candidates. We show through experiments that our ensemble approach consistently outperforms standalone LLMs on the well-known HumanEval and the more challenging LiveCodeBench datasets, achieving an accuracy of 90.2% and 50.2%, respectively, on the two datasets. In comparison, the best-performing LLM (GPT-4o) has an accuracy of 83.5% and 43.4%, respectively. Furthermore, even when restricted to free open-source models, our method achieves an accuracy of 80.5% and 41.6%, respectively, demonstrating the viability of our approach in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |

OpenCAMS is designed to support advanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by combining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides large-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D perception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables modular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized, bidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation progression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while preserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and render a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control logic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and traffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to both mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside units) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the foundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and future-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this core without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture. The OpenCAMS platform is fully open-source and publicly available through its GitHub repository https://github.com/minhaj6/carla-sumo-omnetpp-cosim, providing the research community with an accessible, flexible, and collaborative environment for advancing next-generation intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are AI-Generated Fixes Secure? Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Structure and Semantics of Identifier Names Containing Closed Syntactic Category Words](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18444v4)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifier names are crucial components of code, serving as primary clues for developers to understand program behavior. This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code Completion: Experience on WeChat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18515v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval. Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths. Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of RAG methods in real-world development environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICSME 25 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |

Our goal is to demonstrate that BP can serve as an abstraction that integrates various techniques, enabling a multifaceted analysis and a rich development process. Specifically, the paper examines how the BPpy framework, a Python-based implementation of BP, is enhanced by and enhances various FM and AI tools. We assess how integrating BP with tools such as Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers, symbolic and probabilistic model checking, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) allow us to scale the abilities of BP to model complex systems. Additionally, we illustrate how developers can leverage multiple tools within a single modeling and development task. The paper provides quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting the feasibility of our vision to create a comprehensive toolbox for harnessing AI and FM methods in a unified development framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 20th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering (ENASE 2025)</p></details> |

While the link between fairness and job satisfaction has been established in other fields, its relevance to software professionals remains underexplored. This study examines how fairness perceptions relate to job satisfaction among software practitioners, focusing on both general trends and demographic-specific differences. We conducted an online survey of 108 software practitioners, followed by ordinal logistic regression to analyze the relationship between fairness perceptions and job satisfaction in software engineering contexts, with moderation analysis examining how this relationship varies across demographic groups. Our findings indicate that all four fairness dimensions (namely distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational fairness) significantly affect overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with job security. Among these, interpersonal fairness has the biggest impact. The relationship between fairness and job satisfaction is stronger for female, ethnically underrepresented, less experienced practitioners, and those with work limitations. Fairness in authorship emerged as an important factor for job satisfaction collectively, while fairness in policy implementation, high-demand situations, and working hours impacted specific demographic groups. This study highlights the role of fairness among software practitioners, offering strategies for organizations to promote fair practices and targeted approaches for certain demographic groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools. The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation environments. This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus, extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available, certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the 16th International Modelica and FMI Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLMShot: Reducing snapshot testing maintenance via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10062v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot testing has emerged as a critical technique for UI validation in modern software development, yet it suffers from substantial maintenance overhead due to frequent UI changes causing test failures that require manual inspection to distinguish between genuine regressions and intentional design changes. This manual triage process becomes increasingly burdensome as applications evolve, creating a need for automated analysis solutions. This paper introduces LLMShot, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically analyze snapshot test failures through semantic classification of UI changes. To evaluate LLMShot's effectiveness, we developed a comprehensive dataset using a feature-rich iOS application with configurable feature flags, creating realistic scenarios that produce authentic snapshot differences representative of real development workflows. Our evaluation using Gemma3 models demonstrates strong classification performance, with the 12B variant achieving over 84% recall in identifying failure root causes while the 4B model offers practical deployment advantages with acceptable performance for continuous integration environments. However, our exploration of selective ignore mechanisms revealed significant limitations in current prompting-based approaches for controllable visual reasoning. LLMShot represents the first automated approach to semantic snapshot test analysis, offering developers structured insights that can substantially reduce manual triage effort and advance toward more intelligent UI testing paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |

Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without any specific selection. In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches. Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases known in the bug localisation community on our dataset. Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally, we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[YATE: The Role of Test Repair in LLM-Based Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18316v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code. YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20% more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Scheduzz: Constraint-based Fuzz Driver Generation with Dual Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18289v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However, they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and generating false positive bug reports. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop, multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or suspension. We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and 1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer, Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition, Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries, 3 of which have been assigned CVEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study on Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robot (EAIR) Software Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18267v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs. To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15 distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards. Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction, detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.</p></details> |  |

The process starts with requirements as input, while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel, XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation, simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++). Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, creating high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and qualitative developer studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |

Our framework is powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our orchestration engine intelligently selects among three complementary circuit optimizers: A DRL-based circuit rewriter trained to reduce depth and gate count via learned rewrite sequences; a domain-specific optimizer that performs efficient local gate resynthesis and numeric optimization; a parameterized circuit instantiator that improves compilation by optimizing template circuits during gate set translation. These modules are coordinated by a central orchestration engine that learns coordination policies based on circuit structure, hardware constraints, and backend-aware performance features such as gate count, depth, and expected fidelity. The system outputs an optimized circuit for hardware-aware transpilation and execution, leveraging techniques from an existing state-of-the-art approach, called the NISQ Analyzer, to adapt to backend constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025 - Extended Abstract</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Supply Chain and Risks of Large Language Model Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18105v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate, understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities. While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research. To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859 real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from public vulnerability databases. Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks. Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled systems.</p></details> | 26 pages |

In this exploratory study, we present our preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and expansion of the taxonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement - Emerging Results and Vision Track</p></details> |

It enables teams to develop, test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services, GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions. Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity, heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regis...</summary><p>Registered Report Accepted at the 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025 (ICSME'25)</p></details> |

Existing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools struggle to effectively detect vulnerable API usage from these libraries due to limitations in understanding API usage semantics and computational challenges in analyzing complex codebases, leading to inaccurate vulnerability alerts that burden development teams and delay critical security fixes. To address these challenges, we proposed SAVANT by leveraging two insights: proof-of-vulnerability test cases demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be triggered in specific contexts, and Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand code semantics. SAVANT combines semantic preprocessing with LLM-powered context analysis for accurate vulnerability detection. SAVANT first segments source code into meaningful blocks while preserving semantic relationships, then leverages LLM-based reflection to analyze API usage context and determine actual vulnerability impacts. Our evaluation on 55 real-world applications shows that SAVANT achieves 83.8% precision, 73.8% recall, 69.0% accuracy, and 78.5% F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art SCA tools.</p></details> |  |

Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach, PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits, faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities, designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs, along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued, its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to experiment with and scale PjBL practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Frontiers in Education (FIE) 2025.

While prior research has explored traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed, adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns, and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues, labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.</p></details> |  |

A Comparison of Software Tools Intended to Check Rigor and Transparency of Published Work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17991v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues, there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools.

| **[How Software Engineers Engage with AI: A Pragmatic Process Model and Decision Framework Grounded in Industry Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17930v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design, inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured, lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.</p></details> |  |

Although the literature outlines various methods to identify potential design and coding issues in object-oriented programming through source code analysis, such as code smells and SOLID principles, few studies explore how these code-level issues relate to learning difficulties in Object-Oriented Programming. In this study, we explore the relationship of the code issue indicators with common challenges encountered during the learning of object-oriented programming. Using qualitative analysis, we identified the main categories of learning difficulties and, through a literature review, established connections between these difficulties, code smells, and violations of the SOLID principles. As a result, we developed a conceptual map that links code-related issues to specific learning challenges in Object-Oriented Programming. The model was then evaluated by an expert who applied it in the analysis of the student code to assess its relevance and applicability in educational contexts.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces CASCADE, a novel hybrid approach that integrates the advanced coding capabilities of Gemini with the deterministic transformation capabilities of a compiler Intermediate Representation (IR), specifically JavaScript IR (JSIR). By employing Gemini to identify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the most prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code transformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original strings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method overcomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques, eliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving reliability and flexibility. CASCADE is already deployed in Google's production environment, demonstrating substantial improvements in JavaScript deobfuscation efficiency and reducing reverse engineering efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Code Retrieval for Commit Message Generation: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17690v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A commit message describes the main code changes in a commit and plays a crucial role in software maintenance. Existing commit message generation (CMG) approaches typically frame it as a direct mapping which inputs a code diff and produces a brief descriptive sentence as output. However, we argue that relying solely on the code diff is insufficient, as raw code diff fails to capture the full context needed for generating high-quality and informative commit messages. In this paper, we propose a contextual code retrieval-based method called C3Gen to enhance CMG by retrieving commit-relevant code snippets from the repository and incorporating them into the model input to provide richer contextual information at the repository scope. In the experiments, we evaluated the effectiveness of C3Gen across various models using four objective and three subjective metrics. Meanwhile, we design and conduct a human evaluation to investigate how C3Gen-generated commit messages are perceived by human developers. The results show that by incorporating contextual code into the input, C3Gen enables models to effectively leverage additional information to generate more comprehensive and informative commit messages with greater practical value in real-world development scenarios. Further analysis underscores concerns about the reliability of similaritybased metrics and provides empirical insights for CMG.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)</p></details> |

To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate. This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling. We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success. Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.</p></details> |  |

Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), traditionally seen as the gold standard for securing encryption keys and digital trust, are increasingly challenged by cloud-native threats. Real-world breaches have exposed weaknesses in cloud deployments, including misconfigurations, API abuse, and privilege escalations, allowing attackers to access sensitive key material and bypass protections. These incidents reveal that while the hardware remains secure, the surrounding cloud ecosystem introduces systemic vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes notable security failures involving HSMs and TPMs, identifies common attack vectors, and questions longstanding assumptions about their effectiveness in distributed environments. We explore alternative approaches such as confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management. Our findings highlight that while HSMs and TPMs still play a role, modern cloud security requires more adaptive, layered architectures. By evaluating both current weaknesses and emerging models, this research equips cloud architects and security engineers with strategies to reinforce cryptographic trust in the evolving threat landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 Flowcharts, 2 Tables</p></details> |

However, to further reduce the risk of similar attacks occurring, software organizations benefit from knowing what tasks mitigate attack techniques the attackers are currently using to address specific threats, prioritize tasks, and close mitigation gaps. The goal of this study is to aid software organizations in reducing the risk of software supply chain attacks by systematically synthesizing how framework tasks mitigate the attack techniques used in the SolarWinds, Log4j, and XZ Utils attacks. We qualitatively analyzed 106 Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports of the 3 attacks to gather the attack techniques. We then systematically constructed a mapping between attack techniques and the 73 tasks enumerated in 10 software supply chain frameworks. Afterward, we established and ranked priority tasks that mitigate attack techniques. The three mitigation tasks with the highest scores are role-based access control, system monitoring, and boundary protection. Additionally, three mitigation tasks were missing from all ten frameworks, including sustainable open-source software and environmental scanning tools. Thus, software products would still be vulnerable to software supply chain attacks even if organizations adopted all recommended tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs) in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Cyber Security Education through Digital Twins and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17518v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining prominence in cybersecurity for their ability to replicate complex IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology), and IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructures, allowing for real time monitoring, threat analysis, and system simulation. This study investigates how integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations. Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to meet evolving industry demands.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Neural Network Verification via Order Leading Exploration of Branch-and-Bound Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17453v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial perturbations has necessitated formal verification techniques that can rigorously certify the quality of neural networks. As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is a "divide-and-conquer" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these sub-problems in a naive "first-come-first-serve" manner, thereby suffering from an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB, concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples. Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including $Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5 models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up to 80X in CIFAR10.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the ECOOP 2025 paper, with a comparison with DATE 2025 (Figure 7 of RQ1 in Section 5.2), as well as an in-depth discussion of OOPSLA 2025 in the related work (Section 6)</p></details> |
| **[Explicit Vulnerability Generation with LLMs: An Investigation Beyond Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10054v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet their behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities, this study examines a more direct threat: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code samples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, Gemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of generated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate the requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences. Gemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic Prompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most balanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas (e.g., "DevOps Engineer") consistently elicit higher success rates than student personas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is inverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction accuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a moderate range. Our findings expose how LLMs' reliance on pattern recall over semantic reasoning creates significant blind spots in their safety alignments, particularly for requests framed as plausible professional tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Training Data Detection in AI Coders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17389v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in code large language models (CodeLLMs) have made them indispensable tools in modern software engineering. However, these models occasionally produce outputs that contain proprietary or sensitive code snippets, raising concerns about potential non-compliant use of training data, and posing risks to privacy and intellectual property. To ensure responsible and compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become a critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural language settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely underexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured syntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven state-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance across eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a function-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three programming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded from CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design targeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three distinct settings. These mutation strategies are grounded in the well-established Type-1 to Type-4 code clone detection taxonomy. Our study provides a systematic assessment of current TDD techniques for code and offers insights to guide the development of more effective and robust detection methods in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Roseau: Fast, Accurate, Source-based API Breaking Change Analysis in Java](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17369v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding API evolution and the introduction of breaking changes (BCs) in software libraries is essential for library maintainers to manage backward compatibility and for researchers to conduct empirical studies on software library evolution. In Java, tools such as JApiCmp and Revapi are commonly used to detect BCs between library releases, but their reliance on binary JARs limits their applicability. This restriction hinders large-scale longitudinal studies of API evolution and fine-grained analyses such as commit-level BC detection. In this paper, we introduce Roseau, a novel static analysis tool that constructs technology-agnostic API models from library code equipped with rich semantic analyses. API models can be analyzed to study API evolution and compared to identify BCs between any two versions of a library (releases, commits, branches, etc.). Unlike traditional approaches, Roseau can build API models from source code or bytecode, and is optimized for large-scale longitudinal analyses of library histories. We assess the accuracy, performance, and suitability of Roseau for longitudinal studies of API evolution, using JApiCmp and Revapi as baselines. We extend and refine an established benchmark of BCs and show that Roseau achieves higher accuracy (F1 = 0.99) than JApiCmp (F1 = 0.86) and Revapi (F1 = 0.91). We analyze 60 popular libraries from Maven Central and find that Roseau delivers excellent performance, detecting BCs between versions in under two seconds, including in libraries with hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We further illustrate the limitations of JApiCmp and Revapi for longitudinal studies and the novel analysis capabilities offered by Roseau by tracking the evolution of Google's Guava API and the introduction of BCs over 14 years and 6,839 commits, reducing analysis times from a few days to a few minutes.</p></details> |  |

Code smells, which are recurring anomalies in design or style, have been extensively researched in professional code. However, their significance in block-based projects created by novices is still largely unknown. Block-based environments such as Scratch offer a unique, data-rich setting to examine how emergent design problems intersect with the cultivation of computational-thinking (CT) skills. Objective. This research explores the connection between CT proficiency and design-level code smells--issues that may hinder software maintenance and evolution--in programs created by Scratch developers. We seek to identify which CT dimensions align most strongly with which code smells and whether task context moderates those associations. Method. A random sample of aprox. 2 million public Scratch projects is mined. Using open-source linters, we extract nine CT scores and 40 code smell indicators from these projects. After rigorous pre-processing, we apply descriptive analytics, robust correlation tests, stratified cross-validation, and exploratory machine-learning models; qualitative spot-checks contextualize quantitative patterns. Impact. The study will deliver the first large-scale, fine-grained map linking specific CT competencies to concrete design flaws and antipatterns. Results are poised to (i) inform evidence-based curricula and automated feedback systems, (ii) provide effect-size benchmarks for future educational interventions, and (iii) supply an open, pseudonymized dataset and reproducible analysis pipeline for the research community. By clarifying how programming habits influence early skill acquisition, the work advances both computing-education theory and practical tooling for sustainable software maintenance and evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regis...</summary><p>Registered Report accepted at ICSME 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a data virtualization service, focusing on its service architecture and service operations. The infrastructure currently supports six ML applications, each with more than one ML workflow.

| **[Seed&Steer: Guiding Large Language Models with Compilable Prefix and Branch Signals for Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17271v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests play a vital role in the software development lifecycle. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have significantly improved automated test generation, garnering attention from both academia and industry. We revisit LLM-based unit test generation from a novel perspective by decoupling prefix generation and assertion generation. To characterize their respective challenges, we define Initialization Complexity and adopt Cyclomatic Complexity to measure the difficulty of prefix and assertion generation, revealing that the former primarily affects compilation success, while the latter influences test coverage. To address these challenges, we propose Seed&Steer, a two-step approach that combines traditional unit testing techniques with the capabilities of large language models. Seed&Steer leverages conventional unit testing tools (e.g., EvoSuite) to generate method invocations with high compilation success rates, which serve as seeds to guide LLMs in constructing effective test contexts. It then introduces branching cues to help LLMs explore diverse execution paths (e.g., normal, boundary, and exception cases) and generate assertions with high coverage. We evaluate Seed&Steer on five real-world Java projects against state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that Seed&Steer improves the compilation pass rate by approximately 7%, successfully compiling 792 and 887 previously failing cases on two LLMs. It also achieves up to ~73% branch and line coverage across focal methods of varying complexity, with coverage improvements ranging from 1.09* to 1.26*. Our code, dataset, and experimental scripts will be publicly released to support future research and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

The project faced critical setbacks due to a big-bang integration approach, where all components developed by multiple geographically dispersed partners were merged at the final stage. The integration effort resulted in only six minutes of system functionality, far below the expected 40 minutes. Through root cause analysis, the study identifies technical and organisational barriers, including poor communication, lack of early integration testing, and resistance to topdown planning. It also considers psychological factors such as a bias toward fully developed components over mockups. The paper advocates for early mock based deployment, robust communication infrastructures, and the adoption of topdown thinking to manage complexity and reduce risk in reactive, distributed projects. These findings underscore the limitations of traditional Agile methods in such contexts and propose simulation-driven engineering and structured integration cycles as key enablers for future success.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted @ XP2025 Poster session</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Prompt Programming Tasks and Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17264v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting foundation models (FMs) like large language models (LLMs) have enabled new AI-powered software features (e.g., text summarization) that previously were only possible by fine-tuning FMs. Now, developers are embedding prompts in software, known as prompt programs. The process of prompt programming requires the developer to make many changes to their prompt. Yet, the questions developers ask to update their prompt is unknown, despite the answers to these questions affecting how developers plan their changes. With the growing number of research and commercial prompt programming tools, it is unclear whether prompt programmers' needs are being adequately addressed. We address these challenges by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks prompt programmers do and 51 questions they ask, measuring the importance of each task and question. We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make prompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48 research and commercial tools. We find that prompt programming is not well-supported: all tasks are done manually, and 16 of the 51 questions -- including a majority of the most important ones -- remain unanswered. Based on this, we outline important opportunities for prompt programming tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Quantum Unit Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17235v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of quantum software presents significant challenges for software verification and validation, particularly in the context of unit testing. This work presents a comprehensive study on quantum-centric unit tests, comparing traditional statistical approaches with tests specifically designed for quantum circuits. These include tests that run only on a classical computer, such as the Statevector test, as well as those executable on quantum hardware, such as the Swap test and the novel Inverse test. Through an empirical study and detailed analysis on 1,796,880 mutated quantum circuits, we investigate (a) each test's ability to detect subtle discrepancies between the expected and actual states of a quantum circuit, and (b) the number of measurements required to achieve high reliability. The results demonstrate that quantum-centric tests, particularly the Statevector test and the Inverse test, provide clear advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to statistical tests. This work contributes to the development of more robust and scalable strategies for testing quantum software, supporting the future adoption of fault-tolerant quantum computers and promoting more reliable practices in quantum software engineering.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Automatic Generation of GitHub Actions Configurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17165v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Integration (CI) services, such as GitHub Actions, require developers to write YAML-based configurations, which can be tedious and error-prone. Despite the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate software engineering tasks, their ability to generate CI configurations remains underexplored. This paper presents a preliminary study evaluating six LLMs for generating GitHub Actions configurations from natural language descriptions. We assess three general-purpose foundation models (GPT-4o, Llama, and Gemma) and three code-pretrained models (GPT-4.1, Code Llama, and CodeGemma). We also introduce the first labeled dataset of its kind, constructed from GitHub Actions documentation, pairing descriptions with corresponding best-practice YAML configurations. Zero-shot prompting achieves up to 69% similarity with the ground truth, with only 3% perfect matches. Code-pretrained models slightly underperform compared to general-purpose ones in YAML-based CI tasks, revealing LLM limitations for CI configuration generation. Analyzing GPT-4o outputs reveals issues like missing or renamed steps, misinterpreted descriptions, and unnecessary additions that may affect structural and contextual correctness, indicating a gap between generation quality and the precision required for executable CI configurations. Our research offers insights for improving LLM alignment with configuration languages and guiding future efforts on CI automation and tooling support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025 (ICSME'25)</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Reliability of Statistical Maximum Coverage Estimators in Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17093v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Fuzzers are often guided by coverage, making the estimation of maximum achievable coverage a key concern in fuzzing. However, achieving 100% coverage is infeasible for most real-world software systems, regardless of effort. While static reachability analysis can provide an upper bound, it is often highly inaccurate. Recently, statistical estimation methods based on species richness estimators from biostatistics have been proposed as a potential solution. Yet, the lack of reliable benchmarks with labeled ground truth has limited rigorous evaluation of their accuracy. Objective: This work examines the reliability of reachability estimators from two axes: addressing the lack of labeled ground truth and evaluating their reliability on real-world programs. Methods: (1) To address the challenge of labeled ground truth, we propose an evaluation framework that synthetically generates large programs with complex control flows, ensuring well-defined reachability and providing ground truth for evaluation. (2) To address the criticism from use of synthetic benchmarks, we adapt a reliability check for reachability estimators on real-world benchmarks without labeled ground truth -- by varying the size of sampling units, which, in theory, should not affect the estimate. Results: These two studies together will help answer the question of whether current reachability estimators are reliable, and defines a protocol to evaluate future improvements in reachability estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICSME...</summary><p>ICSME'25 Registered Report</p></details> |

The public currently lacks adequate information about train-test overlap: most models have no public train-test overlap statistics, and third parties cannot directly measure train-test overlap since they do not have access to the training data. To make this clear, we document the practices of 30 model developers, finding that just 9 developers report train-test overlap: 4 developers release training data under open-source licenses, enabling the community to directly measure train-test overlap, and 5 developers publish their train-test overlap methodology and statistics. By engaging with language model developers, we provide novel information about train-test overlap for three additional developers. Overall, we take the position that language model developers should publish train-test overlap statistics and/or training data whenever they report evaluation results on public test sets. We hope our work increases transparency into train-test overlap to increase the community-wide trust in model evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Spotlight; 23 pages</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Uncertainty and Quality of Visual Language Action-enabled Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17049v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Language Action (VLA) models are a multi-modal class of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and action planning to enable agents to interpret their environment, comprehend instructions, and perform embodied tasks autonomously. Recently, significant progress has been made to advance this field. These kinds of models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to capture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its decisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality metrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We assess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908 successful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four representative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually labeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our proposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics show moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their utility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found that some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and low-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when test oracles are not available. Our findings challenge the adequacy of current evaluation practices that rely solely on binary success rates and pave the way for improved real-time monitoring and adaptive enhancement of VLA-enabled robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Algorithm for Generating Minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC Test cases for Singular Boolean Expressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14687v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) is a mandatory structural coverage criterion for ensuring the reliability and safety of critical systems. While its strictest form, Unique-Cause MC/DC, offers the highest assurance, research on its efficient test generation has been lacking. This gap is particularly significant, as an analysis of large-scale avionics systems shows that 99.7% of all conditional decisions are, in fact, Singular Boolean Expressions (SBEs) the ideal structure for applying Unique-Cause MC/DC. This paper proposes 'Robin's Rule', a deterministic algorithm that directly constructs a minimal test set of N + 1 cases to guarantee 100% Unique-Cause MC/DC for SBEs with N conditions, without generating a full truth table. To validate our approach, we constructed a benchmark by reformulating the TCAS-II specifications into SBEs and verified the results using an industry-standard, certified commercial tool. The results confirm that our method consistently achieves 100% coverage with the theoretical minimum number of tests and is more efficient than the commercial tool. This work provides a practical and provably optimal solution for verifying safety-critical systems, ensuring both rigor and efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[LLM as a code generator in Agile Model Driven Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18489v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT4 in the auto generation of code represents a significant advancement, yet it is not without its challenges. The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts. This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the high risk threshold for complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Pre-trained Language Models for Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16887v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated promising results for various code-related tasks. However, their effectiveness in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. % for the security community. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for vulnerability detection (VD), their inadequate consideration in data preparation, evaluation setups, and experimental settings undermines the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper introduces RevisitVD, an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction, and semantic-preserving transformations. Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios, such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies, handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a non-negligible amount of labeling errors. This study underscores the importance of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for realistic VD applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking LLM-Based RTL Code Optimization Via Timing Logic Metamorphosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16808v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Register Transfer Level(RTL) code optimization is crucial for achieving high performance and low power consumption in digital circuit design. However, traditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs can generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions, potentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization methods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex timing logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL optimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a specific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on metamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more complex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings. (1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic operations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods on RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow optimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the challenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these findings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL code optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages with 9 pictures and 2 tables</p></details> |

Locating these bugs is crucial for their resolution but challenging. It is even more challenging in deep-learning systems due to their black-box nature. Bugs in these systems are also hidden not only in the code but also in the models and training data, which might make traditional debugging methods less effective. In this article, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the challenges of localizing bugs in deep-learning systems. First, we determine the bug localization performance of four existing techniques using 2,365 bugs from deep-learning systems and 2,913 from traditional software. We found these techniques significantly underperform in localizing deep-learning system bugs. Second, we evaluate how different bug types in deep learning systems impact bug localization. We found that the effectiveness of localization techniques varies with bug type due to their unique challenges. For example, tensor bugs were more accessible to locate due to their structural nature, while all techniques struggled with GPU bugs due to their external dependencies. Third, we investigate the impact of bugs' extrinsic nature on localization in deep-learning systems. We found that deep learning bugs are often extrinsic and thus connected to artifacts other than source code (e.g., GPU, training data), contributing to the poor performance of existing localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Empirical Software Engineering Journal in 2025</p></details> |

To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However, designing effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design choices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java and Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore various RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their effectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically, we (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants to answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new questions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the similarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding partially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find that implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding (HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering similarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG pipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot performance. Our findings show that RAG with our optimal RAG pipeline consistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across models, achieving higher scores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail with LLM-as-a-judge. These findings demonstrate that our optimal RAG pipelines robustly enhance answer quality for a wide range of developer queries including both previously seen and novel questions across different LLMs</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a new database system supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is intended to improve the management of data using natural language processing (NLP) - based intuitive interfaces, and automatic creation of structured queries and semi-structured data formats like yet another markup language (YAML), java script object notation (JSON), and application program interface (API) documentation. The system is intended to strengthen the potential of databases through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is purposed to allow the automation of fundamental tasks such as data modeling, schema creation, query comprehension, and performance optimization. We present in this paper a system that aims to alleviate the main problems with current database technologies. It is meant to reduce the need for technical skills, manual tuning for better performance, and the potential for human error. The AI database employs generative schema inference and format selection to build its schema models and execution formats.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, appears in EDULEARN25 Conference Proceedings</p></details> |

Typically, those models are trained on a vast amount of data scrapped from forums, websites, social media and other internet sources, which may instill harmful and discriminating behavior into the model. To address this issue, we present LangBiTe, a testing platform to systematically assess the presence of biases within an LLM. LangBiTe enables development teams to tailor their test scenarios, and automatically generate and execute the test cases according to a set of user-defined ethical requirements. Each test consists of a prompt fed into the LLM and a corresponding test oracle that scrutinizes the LLM's response for the identification of biases. LangBite provides users with the bias evaluation of LLMs, and end-to-end traceability between the initial ethical requirements and the insights obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Realistic Evaluations of Just-In-Time Vulnerability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10729v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems are increasingly complex, presenting significant challenges in quality assurance. Just-in-time vulnerability prediction (JIT-VP) is a proactive approach to identifying vulnerable commits and providing early warnings about potential security risks. However, we observe that current JIT-VP evaluations rely on an idealized setting, where the evaluation datasets are artificially balanced, consisting exclusively of vulnerability-introducing and vulnerability-fixing commits. To address this limitation, this study assesses the effectiveness of JIT-VP techniques under a more realistic setting that includes both vulnerability-related and vulnerability-neutral commits. To enable a reliable evaluation, we introduce a large-scale public dataset comprising over one million commits from FFmpeg and the Linux kernel. Our empirical analysis of eight state-of-the-art JIT-VP techniques reveals a significant decline in predictive performance when applied to real-world conditions; for example, the average PR-AUC on Linux drops 98% from 0.805 to 0.016. This discrepancy is mainly attributed to the severe class imbalance in real-world datasets, where vulnerability-introducing commits constitute only a small fraction of all commits. To mitigate this issue, we explore the effectiveness of widely adopted techniques for handling dataset imbalance, including customized loss functions, oversampling, and undersampling. Surprisingly, our experimental results indicate that these techniques are ineffective in addressing the imbalance problem in JIT-VP. These findings underscore the importance of realistic evaluations of JIT-VP and the need for domain-specific techniques to address data imbalance in such scenarios.</p></details> |  |

VulGuard automatically mines commit histories, extracts fine-grained code changes, commit messages, and software engineering metrics, and formats them for downstream analysis. In addition, it integrates several state-of-the-art vulnerability prediction models, allowing researchers to train, evaluate, and compare models with minimal setup. By supporting both repository-scale mining and model-level experimentation within a unified framework, VulGuard addresses key challenges in reproducibility and scalability in software security research. VulGuard can also be easily integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool in two influential open-source projects, FFmpeg and the Linux kernel, highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world JIT-VP research and promote standardized benchmarking.

| **[VulCoCo: A Simple Yet Effective Method for Detecting Vulnerable Code Clones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16661v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reuse is common in modern software development, but it can also spread vulnerabilities when developers unknowingly copy risky code. The code fragments that preserve the logic of known vulnerabilities are known as vulnerable code clones (VCCs). Detecting those VCCs is a critical but challenging task. Existing VCC detection tools often rely on syntactic similarity or produce coarse vulnerability predictions without clear explanations, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose VulCoCo, a lightweight and scalable approach that combines embedding-based retrieval with large language model (LLM) validation. Starting from a set of known vulnerable functions, we retrieve syntactically or semantically similar candidate functions from a large corpus and use an LLM to assess whether the candidates retain the vulnerability. Given that there is a lack of reproducible vulnerable code clone benchmarks, we first construct a synthetic benchmark that spans various clone types. Our experiments on the benchmark show that VulCoCo outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in terms of Precision@k and mean average precision (MAP). In addition, we also demonstrate VulCoCo's effectiveness in real-world projects by submitting 400 pull requests (PRs) to 284 open-source projects. Among them, 75 PRs were merged, and 15 resulted in newly published CVEs. We also provide insights to inspire future work to further improve the precision of vulnerable code clone detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge for Code Generation and Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16587v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have been recently exploited as judges for complex natural language processing tasks, such as Q&A. The basic idea is to delegate to an LLM the assessment of the "quality" of the output provided by an automated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only tell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be too expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can also unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a solution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what is the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of LLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code summarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First, quantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code summarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as BLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second, even state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances of these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced solutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check whether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and 1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. For code summarization, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by nine humans for ~1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions. Our findings show that GPT-4-turbo is the best LLM in terms of judging capabilities for both tasks, with "smaller" LLMs featuring tens of billions parameters not being able to cope with judging tasks. However, even the best-performing LLM frequently misjudges the correctness of the code and summary quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TSE.

A Multivocal Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16586v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) enables simulation experts to optimize complex models, but faces challenges in user experience (UX) that limit efficiency and accessibility. While artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated potential to enhance CAE processes, research integrating these fields with a focus on UX remains fragmented. This paper presents a multivocal literature review (MLR) examining how AI enhances UX in CAE software across both academic research and industry implementations. Our analysis reveals significant gaps between academic explorations and industry applications, with companies actively implementing LLMs, adaptive UIs, and recommender systems while academic research focuses primarily on technical capabilities without UX validation. Key findings demonstrate opportunities in AI-powered guidance, adaptive interfaces, and workflow automation that remain underexplored in current research. By mapping the intersection of these domains, this study provides a foundation for future work to address the identified research gaps and advance the integration of AI to improve CAE user experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Explainable Vulnerability Detection in C/C++ Using Edge-Aware Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16540v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting security vulnerabilities in source code remains challenging, particularly due to class imbalance in real-world datasets where vulnerable functions are under-represented. Existing learning-based methods often optimise for recall, leading to high false positive rates and reduced usability in development workflows. Furthermore, many approaches lack explainability, limiting their integration into security workflows. This paper presents ExplainVulD, a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code. The method constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information. These are processed by an edge-aware attention mechanism that incorporates edge-type embeddings to distinguish among program relations. To address class imbalance, the model is trained using class-weighted cross-entropy loss. ExplainVulD achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23 percent across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset. These results represent relative improvements of 4.6 percent in accuracy and 16.9 percent in F1 score compared to the ReVeal model, a prior learning-based method. The framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0 to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by identifying the most influential code regions within each function, supporting transparency and trust in security triage.</p></details> |  |

Traditional automated translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models, narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity. ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in developer acceleration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Large Language Models for Analyzing and Improving Method Names in Scientific Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16439v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research scientists increasingly rely on implementing software to support their research. While previous research has examined the impact of identifier names on program comprehension in traditional programming environments, limited work has explored this area in scientific software, especially regarding the quality of method names in the code. The recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for automating code analysis tasks, such as identifier name appraisals and recommendations. Our study evaluates four popular LLMs on their ability to analyze grammatical patterns and suggest improvements for 496 method names extracted from Python-based Jupyter Notebooks. Our findings show that the LLMs are somewhat effective in analyzing these method names and generally follow good naming practices, like starting method names with verbs. However, their inconsistent handling of domain-specific terminology and only moderate agreement with human annotations indicate that automated suggestions require human evaluation. This work provides foundational insights for improving the quality of scientific code through AI automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement - Emerging Results and Vision Track</p></details> |
| **[Improving Code LLM Robustness to Prompt Perturbations via Layer-Aware Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16407v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation, where the natural language prompt plays a crucial role in conveying user intent to the model. However, prior studies have shown that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt perturbations. Minor modifications in wording, syntax, or formatting can significantly reduce the functional correctness of generated code. As perturbations frequently occur in real-world scenarios, improving the robustness of LLMs to prompt perturbations is essential for ensuring reliable performance in practical code generation. In this paper, we introduce CREME (Code Robustness Enhancement via Model Editing), a novel approach that enhances LLM robustness through targeted parameter updates. CREME first identifies robustness-sensitive layers by comparing hidden states between an original prompt and its perturbed variant. Then, it performs lightweight parameter editing at the identified layer to reduce performance degradation. We evaluate CREME on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP) along with their perturbed counterparts. Experimental results show that CREME improves Pass@1 accuracy by 63% on perturbed prompts while maintaining stable performance on clean inputs, with accuracy deviations within 1%. Further analysis reveals that robustness-sensitive layers are primarily concentrated in the middle and deeper layers of the network, and their locations vary across different model architectures. These insights provide a valuable foundation for developing future robustness-oriented editing strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven Collaborative Model for Untangling Commits via Explicit and Implicit Dependency Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16395v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atomic commits, each of which addresses a single development concern, are a best practice in software development. However, developers frequently produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based, have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG), enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks.</p></details> |  |

During the design of such AVs, it is crucial to understand and identify the settings that should trigger adaptations, enabling validation of their implementation. To this end, we focus on the navigation software of AVs, which must adapt their behavior during operation through adaptations. AVs often rely on predefined waypoints to guide them along designated routes, ensuring safe navigation. We propose a multiobjective search-based approach, called WPgen, to generate minor modifications to the predefined set of waypoints, keeping them as close as possible to the original waypoints, while causing the AV to navigate inappropriately when navigating with the generated waypoints. WPgen uses NSGA-II as the multi-objective search algorithm with three seeding strategies for its initial population, resulting in three variations of WPgen. We evaluated these variations on three AVs (one overwater tanker and two underwater). We compared the three variations of WPgen with Random Search as the baseline and with each other. Experimental results showed that the effectiveness of these variations varied depending on the AV. Based on the results, we present the research and practical implications of WPgen.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures.

This paper explores the role of large language model (LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\% expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\% preferring it over traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact. By addressing current limitations and aligning AI development with ethical and regulatory frameworks, voice-based AI agents can serve as a critical entry point for equitable, sustainable digital healthcare solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Digital Health (ICDH) 2025</p></details> |
| **[LOCOFY Large Design Models -- Design to code conversion solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16208v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in Large Language Models and Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous challenges related to interpretability, scalability, resource requirements and repeatability remain, related to their application in the design-to-code space. To address this, we introduce the Large Design Models (LDMs) paradigm specifically trained on designs and webpages to enable seamless conversion from design-to-code. We have developed a training and inference pipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture modification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design Optimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses sub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and fine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI elements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable components to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while enhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but key issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline processes real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions for code generation and ensures reliability. Additionally, our models illustrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a novel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments indicated superior performance of LDMs against LLMs on accuracy of node positioning, responsiveness and reproducibility. Moreover, our custom-trained tagging and feature detection model demonstrated high precision and consistency in identifying UI elements across a wide sample of test designs. Thus, our proposed LDMs are a reliable and superior solution to understanding designs that subsequently enable the generation of efficient and reliable production-ready code.</p></details> |  |

While existing code evolution benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To address this, we introduce GitChameleon 2.0, a novel, meticulously curated dataset comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon 2.0 rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51% range, underscoring the intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon 2.0 enables a clearer understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and evaluation code publicly available at https://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2 of the dataset from: arXiv:2411.05830</p></details> |

| **[3D Software Synthesis Guided by Constraint-Expressive Intermediate Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18625v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |

OpenCAMS is designed to support advanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by combining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides large-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D perception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables modular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized, bidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation progression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while preserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and render a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control logic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and traffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to both mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside units) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the foundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and future-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this core without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture. The OpenCAMS platform is fully open-source and publicly available through its GitHub repository https://github.com/minhaj6/carla-sumo-omnetpp-cosim, providing the research community with an accessible, flexible, and collaborative environment for advancing next-generation intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are AI-Generated Fixes Secure? Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools. The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation environments. This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus, extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available, certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the 16th International Modelica and FMI Conference 2025</p></details> |

This manual triage process becomes increasingly burdensome as applications evolve, creating a need for automated analysis solutions. This paper introduces LLMShot, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically analyze snapshot test failures through semantic classification of UI changes. To evaluate LLMShot's effectiveness, we developed a comprehensive dataset using a feature-rich iOS application with configurable feature flags, creating realistic scenarios that produce authentic snapshot differences representative of real development workflows. Our evaluation using Gemma3 models demonstrates strong classification performance, with the 12B variant achieving over 84% recall in identifying failure root causes while the 4B model offers practical deployment advantages with acceptable performance for continuous integration environments. However, our exploration of selective ignore mechanisms revealed significant limitations in current prompting-based approaches for controllable visual reasoning. LLMShot represents the first automated approach to semantic snapshot test analysis, offering developers structured insights that can substantially reduce manual triage effort and advance toward more intelligent UI testing paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |

While effective, language models tend to generate many incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code. YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20% more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Scheduzz: Constraint-based Fuzz Driver Generation with Dual Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18289v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However, they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and generating false positive bug reports. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop, multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or suspension. We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and 1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer, Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition, Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries, 3 of which have been assigned CVEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The process starts with requirements as input, while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel, XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation, simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++). Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Retriever Meets Generator: A Joint Model for Code Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12558v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating concise, informative comments for source code can lighten documentation effort and accelerate program comprehension. Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and qualitative developer studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |

It enables teams to develop, test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services, GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions. Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity, heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regis...</summary><p>Registered Report Accepted at the 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025 (ICSME'25)</p></details> |

Existing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools struggle to effectively detect vulnerable API usage from these libraries due to limitations in understanding API usage semantics and computational challenges in analyzing complex codebases, leading to inaccurate vulnerability alerts that burden development teams and delay critical security fixes. To address these challenges, we proposed SAVANT by leveraging two insights: proof-of-vulnerability test cases demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be triggered in specific contexts, and Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand code semantics. SAVANT combines semantic preprocessing with LLM-powered context analysis for accurate vulnerability detection. SAVANT first segments source code into meaningful blocks while preserving semantic relationships, then leverages LLM-based reflection to analyze API usage context and determine actual vulnerability impacts. Our evaluation on 55 real-world applications shows that SAVANT achieves 83.8% precision, 73.8% recall, 69.0% accuracy, and 78.5% F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art SCA tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Use as Directed? A Comparison of Software Tools Intended to Check Rigor and Transparency of Published Work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17991v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues, there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data for the study is available at https://github.com/PeterEckmann1/tool-comparison.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces CASCADE, a novel hybrid approach that integrates the advanced coding capabilities of Gemini with the deterministic transformation capabilities of a compiler Intermediate Representation (IR), specifically JavaScript IR (JSIR). By employing Gemini to identify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the most prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code transformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original strings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method overcomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques, eliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving reliability and flexibility. CASCADE is already deployed in Google's production environment, demonstrating substantial improvements in JavaScript deobfuscation efficiency and reducing reverse engineering efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to Model Context Protocol Servers for Tool-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16044v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate. This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling. We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success. Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates how integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations. Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to meet evolving industry demands.</p></details> |  |

| **[Are AI-Generated Fixes Secure? Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code Completion: Experience on WeChat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18515v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval. Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths. Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of RAG methods in real-world development environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICSME 25 Industry Track</p></details> |

However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMShot: Reducing snapshot testing maintenance via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10062v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot testing has emerged as a critical technique for UI validation in modern software development, yet it suffers from substantial maintenance overhead due to frequent UI changes causing test failures that require manual inspection to distinguish between genuine regressions and intentional design changes. This manual triage process becomes increasingly burdensome as applications evolve, creating a need for automated analysis solutions. This paper introduces LLMShot, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically analyze snapshot test failures through semantic classification of UI changes. To evaluate LLMShot's effectiveness, we developed a comprehensive dataset using a feature-rich iOS application with configurable feature flags, creating realistic scenarios that produce authentic snapshot differences representative of real development workflows. Our evaluation using Gemma3 models demonstrates strong classification performance, with the 12B variant achieving over 84% recall in identifying failure root causes while the 4B model offers practical deployment advantages with acceptable performance for continuous integration environments. However, our exploration of selective ignore mechanisms revealed significant limitations in current prompting-based approaches for controllable visual reasoning. LLMShot represents the first automated approach to semantic snapshot test analysis, offering developers structured insights that can substantially reduce manual triage effort and advance toward more intelligent UI testing paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |

While effective, language models tend to generate many incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code. YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20% more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Scheduzz: Constraint-based Fuzz Driver Generation with Dual Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18289v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However, they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and generating false positive bug reports. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop, multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or suspension. We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and 1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer, Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition, Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries, 3 of which have been assigned CVEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The process starts with requirements as input, while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel, XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation, simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++). Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoCode-bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Natural Language-Driven Feature Addition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18130v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code, promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Supply Chain and Risks of Large Language Model Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18105v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate, understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities. While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research. To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859 real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from public vulnerability databases. Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks. Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled systems.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[SAVANT: Vulnerability Detection in Application Dependencies through Semantic-Guided Reachability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17798v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of open-source third-party library dependencies in Java development introduces significant security risks when these libraries contain known vulnerabilities. Existing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools struggle to effectively detect vulnerable API usage from these libraries due to limitations in understanding API usage semantics and computational challenges in analyzing complex codebases, leading to inaccurate vulnerability alerts that burden development teams and delay critical security fixes. To address these challenges, we proposed SAVANT by leveraging two insights: proof-of-vulnerability test cases demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be triggered in specific contexts, and Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand code semantics. SAVANT combines semantic preprocessing with LLM-powered context analysis for accurate vulnerability detection. SAVANT first segments source code into meaningful blocks while preserving semantic relationships, then leverages LLM-based reflection to analyze API usage context and determine actual vulnerability impacts. Our evaluation on 55 real-world applications shows that SAVANT achieves 83.8% precision, 73.8% recall, 69.0% accuracy, and 78.5% F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art SCA tools.</p></details> |  |

While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |

OpenCAMS is designed to support advanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by combining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides large-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D perception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables modular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized, bidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation progression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while preserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and render a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control logic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and traffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to both mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside units) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the foundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and future-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this core without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture. The OpenCAMS platform is fully open-source and publicly available through its GitHub repository https://github.com/minhaj6/carla-sumo-omnetpp-cosim, providing the research community with an accessible, flexible, and collaborative environment for advancing next-generation intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</p></details> |

We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Structure and Semantics of Identifier Names Containing Closed Syntactic Category Words](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18444v4)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifier names are crucial components of code, serving as primary clues for developers to understand program behavior. This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code Completion: Experience on WeChat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18515v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval. Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths. Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of RAG methods in real-world development environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICSME 25 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |

Our goal is to demonstrate that BP can serve as an abstraction that integrates various techniques, enabling a multifaceted analysis and a rich development process. Specifically, the paper examines how the BPpy framework, a Python-based implementation of BP, is enhanced by and enhances various FM and AI tools. We assess how integrating BP with tools such as Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers, symbolic and probabilistic model checking, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) allow us to scale the abilities of BP to model complex systems. Additionally, we illustrate how developers can leverage multiple tools within a single modeling and development task. The paper provides quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting the feasibility of our vision to create a comprehensive toolbox for harnessing AI and FM methods in a unified development framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 20th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering (ENASE 2025)</p></details> |

While the link between fairness and job satisfaction has been established in other fields, its relevance to software professionals remains underexplored. This study examines how fairness perceptions relate to job satisfaction among software practitioners, focusing on both general trends and demographic-specific differences. We conducted an online survey of 108 software practitioners, followed by ordinal logistic regression to analyze the relationship between fairness perceptions and job satisfaction in software engineering contexts, with moderation analysis examining how this relationship varies across demographic groups. Our findings indicate that all four fairness dimensions (namely distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational fairness) significantly affect overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with job security. Among these, interpersonal fairness has the biggest impact. The relationship between fairness and job satisfaction is stronger for female, ethnically underrepresented, less experienced practitioners, and those with work limitations. Fairness in authorship emerged as an important factor for job satisfaction collectively, while fairness in policy implementation, high-demand situations, and working hours impacted specific demographic groups. This study highlights the role of fairness among software practitioners, offering strategies for organizations to promote fair practices and targeted approaches for certain demographic groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools. The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation environments. This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus, extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available, certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the 16th International Modelica and FMI Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLMShot: Reducing snapshot testing maintenance via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10062v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot testing has emerged as a critical technique for UI validation in modern software development, yet it suffers from substantial maintenance overhead due to frequent UI changes causing test failures that require manual inspection to distinguish between genuine regressions and intentional design changes. This manual triage process becomes increasingly burdensome as applications evolve, creating a need for automated analysis solutions. This paper introduces LLMShot, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically analyze snapshot test failures through semantic classification of UI changes. To evaluate LLMShot's effectiveness, we developed a comprehensive dataset using a feature-rich iOS application with configurable feature flags, creating realistic scenarios that produce authentic snapshot differences representative of real development workflows. Our evaluation using Gemma3 models demonstrates strong classification performance, with the 12B variant achieving over 84% recall in identifying failure root causes while the 4B model offers practical deployment advantages with acceptable performance for continuous integration environments. However, our exploration of selective ignore mechanisms revealed significant limitations in current prompting-based approaches for controllable visual reasoning. LLMShot represents the first automated approach to semantic snapshot test analysis, offering developers structured insights that can substantially reduce manual triage effort and advance toward more intelligent UI testing paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |

Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without any specific selection. In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches. Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases known in the bug localisation community on our dataset. Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally, we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[YATE: The Role of Test Repair in LLM-Based Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18316v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code. YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20% more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Scheduzz: Constraint-based Fuzz Driver Generation with Dual Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18289v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However, they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and generating false positive bug reports. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop, multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or suspension. We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and 1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer, Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition, Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries, 3 of which have been assigned CVEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study on Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robot (EAIR) Software Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18267v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs. To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15 distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards. Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction, detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.</p></details> |  |

The process starts with requirements as input, while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel, XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation, simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++). Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, creating high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and qualitative developer studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |

Our framework is powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our orchestration engine intelligently selects among three complementary circuit optimizers: A DRL-based circuit rewriter trained to reduce depth and gate count via learned rewrite sequences; a domain-specific optimizer that performs efficient local gate resynthesis and numeric optimization; a parameterized circuit instantiator that improves compilation by optimizing template circuits during gate set translation. These modules are coordinated by a central orchestration engine that learns coordination policies based on circuit structure, hardware constraints, and backend-aware performance features such as gate count, depth, and expected fidelity. The system outputs an optimized circuit for hardware-aware transpilation and execution, leveraging techniques from an existing state-of-the-art approach, called the NISQ Analyzer, to adapt to backend constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025 - Extended Abstract</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Supply Chain and Risks of Large Language Model Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18105v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate, understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities. While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research. To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859 real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from public vulnerability databases. Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks. Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled systems.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, research has shown that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and expansion of the taxonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement - Emerging Results and Vision Track</p></details> |

It enables teams to develop, test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services, GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions. Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity, heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regis...</summary><p>Registered Report Accepted at the 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025 (ICSME'25)</p></details> |

Existing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools struggle to effectively detect vulnerable API usage from these libraries due to limitations in understanding API usage semantics and computational challenges in analyzing complex codebases, leading to inaccurate vulnerability alerts that burden development teams and delay critical security fixes. To address these challenges, we proposed SAVANT by leveraging two insights: proof-of-vulnerability test cases demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be triggered in specific contexts, and Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand code semantics. SAVANT combines semantic preprocessing with LLM-powered context analysis for accurate vulnerability detection. SAVANT first segments source code into meaningful blocks while preserving semantic relationships, then leverages LLM-based reflection to analyze API usage context and determine actual vulnerability impacts. Our evaluation on 55 real-world applications shows that SAVANT achieves 83.8% precision, 73.8% recall, 69.0% accuracy, and 78.5% F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art SCA tools.</p></details> |  |

Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach, PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits, faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities, designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs, along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued, its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to experiment with and scale PjBL practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Frontiers in Education (FIE) 2025.

There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed, adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns, and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues, labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.</p></details> |  |

A Comparison of Software Tools Intended to Check Rigor and Transparency of Published Work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17991v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues, there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data for the study is available at https://github.com/PeterEckmann1/tool-comparison.</p></details> |  |

Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design, inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured, lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.</p></details> |  |

Although the literature outlines various methods to identify potential design and coding issues in object-oriented programming through source code analysis, such as code smells and SOLID principles, few studies explore how these code-level issues relate to learning difficulties in Object-Oriented Programming. In this study, we explore the relationship of the code issue indicators with common challenges encountered during the learning of object-oriented programming. Using qualitative analysis, we identified the main categories of learning difficulties and, through a literature review, established connections between these difficulties, code smells, and violations of the SOLID principles. As a result, we developed a conceptual map that links code-related issues to specific learning challenges in Object-Oriented Programming. The model was then evaluated by an expert who applied it in the analysis of the student code to assess its relevance and applicability in educational contexts.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces CASCADE, a novel hybrid approach that integrates the advanced coding capabilities of Gemini with the deterministic transformation capabilities of a compiler Intermediate Representation (IR), specifically JavaScript IR (JSIR). By employing Gemini to identify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the most prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code transformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original strings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method overcomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques, eliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving reliability and flexibility. CASCADE is already deployed in Google's production environment, demonstrating substantial improvements in JavaScript deobfuscation efficiency and reducing reverse engineering efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Code Retrieval for Commit Message Generation: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17690v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A commit message describes the main code changes in a commit and plays a crucial role in software maintenance. Existing commit message generation (CMG) approaches typically frame it as a direct mapping which inputs a code diff and produces a brief descriptive sentence as output. However, we argue that relying solely on the code diff is insufficient, as raw code diff fails to capture the full context needed for generating high-quality and informative commit messages. In this paper, we propose a contextual code retrieval-based method called C3Gen to enhance CMG by retrieving commit-relevant code snippets from the repository and incorporating them into the model input to provide richer contextual information at the repository scope. In the experiments, we evaluated the effectiveness of C3Gen across various models using four objective and three subjective metrics. Meanwhile, we design and conduct a human evaluation to investigate how C3Gen-generated commit messages are perceived by human developers. The results show that by incorporating contextual code into the input, C3Gen enables models to effectively leverage additional information to generate more comprehensive and informative commit messages with greater practical value in real-world development scenarios. Further analysis underscores concerns about the reliability of similaritybased metrics and provides empirical insights for CMG.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)</p></details> |
| **[Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to Model Context Protocol Servers for Tool-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16044v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate. This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling. We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success. Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.</p></details> |  |

Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), traditionally seen as the gold standard for securing encryption keys and digital trust, are increasingly challenged by cloud-native threats. Real-world breaches have exposed weaknesses in cloud deployments, including misconfigurations, API abuse, and privilege escalations, allowing attackers to access sensitive key material and bypass protections. These incidents reveal that while the hardware remains secure, the surrounding cloud ecosystem introduces systemic vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes notable security failures involving HSMs and TPMs, identifies common attack vectors, and questions longstanding assumptions about their effectiveness in distributed environments. We explore alternative approaches such as confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management. Our findings highlight that while HSMs and TPMs still play a role, modern cloud security requires more adaptive, layered architectures. By evaluating both current weaknesses and emerging models, this research equips cloud architects and security engineers with strategies to reinforce cryptographic trust in the evolving threat landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 Flowcharts, 2 Tables</p></details> |

However, to further reduce the risk of similar attacks occurring, software organizations benefit from knowing what tasks mitigate attack techniques the attackers are currently using to address specific threats, prioritize tasks, and close mitigation gaps. The goal of this study is to aid software organizations in reducing the risk of software supply chain attacks by systematically synthesizing how framework tasks mitigate the attack techniques used in the SolarWinds, Log4j, and XZ Utils attacks. We qualitatively analyzed 106 Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports of the 3 attacks to gather the attack techniques. We then systematically constructed a mapping between attack techniques and the 73 tasks enumerated in 10 software supply chain frameworks. Afterward, we established and ranked priority tasks that mitigate attack techniques. The three mitigation tasks with the highest scores are role-based access control, system monitoring, and boundary protection. Additionally, three mitigation tasks were missing from all ten frameworks, including sustainable open-source software and environmental scanning tools. Thus, software products would still be vulnerable to software supply chain attacks even if organizations adopted all recommended tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs) in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Cyber Security Education through Digital Twins and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17518v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining prominence in cybersecurity for their ability to replicate complex IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology), and IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructures, allowing for real time monitoring, threat analysis, and system simulation. This study investigates how integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations. Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to meet evolving industry demands.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Neural Network Verification via Order Leading Exploration of Branch-and-Bound Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17453v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial perturbations has necessitated formal verification techniques that can rigorously certify the quality of neural networks. As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is a "divide-and-conquer" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these sub-problems in a naive "first-come-first-serve" manner, thereby suffering from an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB, concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples. Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including $Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5 models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up to 80X in CIFAR10.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the ECOOP 2025 paper, with a comparison with DATE 2025 (Figure 7 of RQ1 in Section 5.2), as well as an in-depth discussion of OOPSLA 2025 in the related work (Section 6)</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</p></details> |

In recent years, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval. Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths. Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of RAG methods in real-world development environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICSME 25 Industry Track</p></details> |

However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |

While effective, language models tend to generate many incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code. YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20% more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

The process starts with requirements as input, while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel, XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation, simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++). Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Retriever Meets Generator: A Joint Model for Code Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12558v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating concise, informative comments for source code can lighten documentation effort and accelerate program comprehension. Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and qualitative developer studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[NoCode-bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Natural Language-Driven Feature Addition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18130v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code, promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifier Name Similarities: An Exploratory Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18081v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and expansion of the taxonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement - Emerging Results and Vision Track</p></details> |
| **[SAVANT: Vulnerability Detection in Application Dependencies through Semantic-Guided Reachability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17798v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of open-source third-party library dependencies in Java development introduces significant security risks when these libraries contain known vulnerabilities. Existing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools struggle to effectively detect vulnerable API usage from these libraries due to limitations in understanding API usage semantics and computational challenges in analyzing complex codebases, leading to inaccurate vulnerability alerts that burden development teams and delay critical security fixes. To address these challenges, we proposed SAVANT by leveraging two insights: proof-of-vulnerability test cases demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be triggered in specific contexts, and Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand code semantics. SAVANT combines semantic preprocessing with LLM-powered context analysis for accurate vulnerability detection. SAVANT first segments source code into meaningful blocks while preserving semantic relationships, then leverages LLM-based reflection to analyze API usage context and determine actual vulnerability impacts. Our evaluation on 55 real-world applications shows that SAVANT achieves 83.8% precision, 73.8% recall, 69.0% accuracy, and 78.5% F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art SCA tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Use as Directed? A Comparison of Software Tools Intended to Check Rigor and Transparency of Published Work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17991v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues, there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data for the study is available at https://github.com/PeterEckmann1/tool-comparison.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Software Engineers Engage with AI: A Pragmatic Process Model and Decision Framework Grounded in Industry Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17930v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design, inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured, lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Educational Insights from Code: Mapping Learning Challenges in Object-Oriented Programming through Code-Based Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17743v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-Oriented programming is frequently challenging for undergraduate Computer Science students, particularly in understanding abstract concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Although the literature outlines various methods to identify potential design and coding issues in object-oriented programming through source code analysis, such as code smells and SOLID principles, few studies explore how these code-level issues relate to learning difficulties in Object-Oriented Programming. In this study, we explore the relationship of the code issue indicators with common challenges encountered during the learning of object-oriented programming. Using qualitative analysis, we identified the main categories of learning difficulties and, through a literature review, established connections between these difficulties, code smells, and violations of the SOLID principles. As a result, we developed a conceptual map that links code-related issues to specific learning challenges in Object-Oriented Programming. The model was then evaluated by an expert who applied it in the analysis of the student code to assess its relevance and applicability in educational contexts.</p></details> |  |

| **[3D Software Synthesis Guided by Constraint-Expressive Intermediate Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18625v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |

OpenCAMS is designed to support advanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by combining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides large-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D perception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables modular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized, bidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation progression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while preserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and render a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control logic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and traffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to both mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside units) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the foundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and future-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this core without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture. The OpenCAMS platform is fully open-source and publicly available through its GitHub repository https://github.com/minhaj6/carla-sumo-omnetpp-cosim, providing the research community with an accessible, flexible, and collaborative environment for advancing next-generation intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are AI-Generated Fixes Secure? Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Structure and Semantics of Identifier Names Containing Closed Syntactic Category Words](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18444v4)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifier names are crucial components of code, serving as primary clues for developers to understand program behavior. This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code Completion: Experience on WeChat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18515v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval. Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths. Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of RAG methods in real-world development environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICSME 25 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.</p></details> |  |
