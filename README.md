| **[Observing Fine-Grained Changes in Jupyter Notebooks During Development Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15831v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In software engineering, numerous studies have focused on the analysis of fine-grained logs, leading to significant innovations in areas such as refactoring, security, and code completion. However, no similar studies have been conducted for computational notebooks in the context of data science. To help bridge this research gap, we make three scientific contributions: we (1) introduce a toolset for collecting code changes in Jupyter notebooks during development time; (2) use it to collect more than 100 hours of work related to a data analysis task and a machine learning task (carried out by 20 developers with different levels of expertise), resulting in a dataset containing 2,655 cells and 9,207 cell executions; and (3) use this dataset to investigate the dynamic nature of the notebook development process and the changes that take place in the notebooks. In our analysis of the collected data, we classified the changes made to the cells between executions and found that a significant number of these changes were relatively small fixes and code iteration modifications. This suggests that notebooks are used not only as a development and exploration tool but also as a debugging tool. We report a number of other insights and propose potential future research directions on the novel data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

Although practitioners and researchers have deemed Evidence Briefings useful, their production requires manual labor, which may be a significant challenge to their broad adoption. [Goal] The goal of this registered report is to describe an experimental protocol for evaluating LLM-generated evidence briefings for secondary studies in terms of content fidelity, ease of understanding, and usefulness, as perceived by researchers and practitioners, compared to human-made briefings. [Method] We developed an RAG-based LLM tool to generate evidence briefings. We used the tool to automatically generate two evidence briefings that had been manually generated in previous research efforts. We designed a controlled experiment to evaluate how the LLM-generated briefings compare to the human-made ones regarding perceived content fidelity, ease of understanding, and usefulness. [Results] To be reported after the experimental trials. [Conclusion] Depending on the experiment results.</p></details> | <details><summary>ESEM ...</summary><p>ESEM 2025 Registered Report with an IPA (In Principle Acceptance) for the Empirical Software Engineering journal</p></details> |
| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[BugScope: Learn to Find Bugs Like Human](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15671v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting software bugs remains a fundamental challenge due to the extensive diversity of real-world defects. Traditional static analysis tools often rely on symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to customized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue to struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited analysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug patterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code auditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy behaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant detection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection prompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score. Further testing on large-scale open-source systems, including the Linux kernel, uncovered 141 previously unknown bugs, of which 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed by developers, highlighting BugScope's substantial practical impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |
| **[SustainDiffusion: Optimising the Social and Environmental Sustainability of Stable Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15663v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Text-to-image generation models are widely used across numerous domains. Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability. Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models. Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model. Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts. Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.</p></details> |  |

Although recent studies have shown the popularity and advantages of React in web development, the specific challenges users face remain unknown. Thus, this study aims to analyse the React-related questions shared on Stack Overflow. The study utilizes an exploratory data analysis to investigate the most frequently discussed keywords, error classification, and user reputation-based errors, which is the novelty of this work. The results show the top eight most frequently used keywords on React-related questions, namely, code, link, vir, href, connect, azure, windows, and website. The error classification of questions from the sample shows that algorithmic error is the most frequent issue faced by all groups of users, where mid-reputation users contribute the most, accounting for 55.77%. This suggests the need for the community to provide guidance materials in solving algorithm-related problems. We expect that the results of this study will provide valuable insight into future research to support the React community during the early stages of implementation, facilitating their ability to effectively overcome challenges to adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Applying the Chinese Wall Reverse Engineering Technique to Large Language Model Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15599v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code (Code LLM) are increasingly utilized in programming environments. Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of LLMs' Preferences for Libraries and Programming Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17181v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, influencing users' choices of libraries and programming languages in critical real-world projects. However, little is known about their systematic biases or preferences toward certain libraries and programming languages, which can significantly impact software development practices. To fill this gap, we perform the first empirical study of LLMs' preferences for libraries and programming languages when generating code, covering eight diverse LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to overuse widely adopted libraries such as NumPy; in up to 48% of cases, this usage is unnecessary and deviates from the ground-truth solutions. LLMs also exhibit a significant preference toward Python as their default language. For high-performance project initialisation tasks where Python is not the optimal language, it remains the dominant choice in 58% of cases, and Rust is not used a single time. These results indicate that LLMs may prioritise familiarity and popularity over suitability and task-specific optimality. This will introduce security vulnerabilities and technical debt, and limit exposure to newly developed, better-suited tools and languages. Understanding and addressing these biases is essential for the responsible integration of LLMs into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures.

| **[CGP-Tuning: Structure-Aware Soft Prompt Tuning for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04510v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs. However, existing fine-tuning techniques often treat source code as plain text, losing the graph-based structural information inherent in code. Graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning addresses this by translating the structural information into contextual cues that the LLM can understand. However, current methods are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information, they fall short in preserving the rich semantic information (e.g., control/data flow) within code graphs. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while capturing graph-text interactions in their cross-modal alignment module. This paper presents CGP-Tuning, a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection. CGP-Tuning introduces type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with an efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational costs while incorporating graph-text interactions. It is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and three advanced open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeGemma, and Qwen2.5-Coder. Experimental results show that CGP-Tuning delivers model-agnostic improvements and maintains practical inference speed, surpassing the best graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning baseline by an average of four percentage points and outperforming non-tuned zero-shot prompting by 15 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Design Decisions of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19463v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, practitioners face significant challenges when making RAG deployment decisions. While existing research prioritizes algorithmic innovations, a systematic gap persists in understanding fundamental engineering trade-offs that determine RAG success. We present the first comprehensive study of three universal RAG deployment decisions: whether to deploy RAG, how much information to retrieve, and how to integrate retrieved knowledge effectively. Through systematic experiments across three LLMs and six datasets spanning question answering and code generation tasks, we reveal critical insights: (1) RAG deployment must be highly selective, with variable recall thresholds and failure modes affecting up to 12.6\% of samples even with perfect documents. (2) Optimal retrieval volume exhibits task-dependent behavior QA tasks show universal patterns (5-10 documents optimal) while code generation requires scenario-specific optimization. (3) Knowledge integration effectiveness depends on task and model characteristics, with code generation benefiting significantly from prompting methods while question answering shows minimal improvement. These findings demonstrate that universal RAG strategies prove inadequate. Effective RAG systems require context-aware design decisions based on task characteristics and model capabilities. Our analysis provides evidence-based guidance for practitioners and establishes foundational insights for principled RAG deployment.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02274v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Comprehension Benchmark for Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10641v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks. The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability. Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 5 Figures |

We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits. Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code, supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain. Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts, simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models, demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables, IEEE Conference format, Q4 2025 model release, Q1 2026 Kodezi OS deployment</p></details> |

This paper documents the design, implementation, and iterative debugging of a novel, serverless system for real-time stock analysis. The system leverages the Gemini API for qualitative assessment, automates data ingestion and processing via GitHub Actions, and presents the findings through a decoupled, static frontend. We detail the architectural evolution of the system, from initial concepts to a robust, event-driven pipeline, highlighting the practical challenges encountered during deployment. A significant portion of this paper is dedicated to a case study on the debugging process, covering common software errors, platform-specific permission issues, and rare, environment-level platform bugs. The final architecture operates at a near-zero cost, demonstrating a viable model for individuals to build sophisticated AI-powered financial tools.

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool for Supporting Debugging and Understanding of Normative Requirements Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05504v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal verification offers strong assurances of software correctness. However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge graphs, our approach aims to reduce hallucinations and increase the factual accuracy of generated responses. The system provides an interactive experience similar to ChatGPT, tailored specifically for ReservoirPy, enabling users to write, debug, and understand Python code while accessing reliable domain-specific insights. In our evaluation, while proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o and NotebookLM performed slightly better on general knowledge questions, our model outperformed them on coding tasks and showed a significant improvement over its base model, Codestral-22B.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03156v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/15788502.</p></details> | 37 pages |

However, traditional testing approaches involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities, providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Deduplicating Compiler Bugs with Bisection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It allows verifying that the students correctly apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students' misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g., no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to configure. To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CompEd'25, 7 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks, establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |

Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |

However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs.

As quantum computing transitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present in classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited observability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific tools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software developers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews focused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants reported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing (54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31% reported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual methods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies, such as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which respondents noted do not scale well. The most frequently cited sources of bugs were classical in nature-library updates (81%), developer mistakes (68%), and compatibility issues (62%)-often worsened by limited abstraction in existing SDKs. These findings highlight the urgent need for better-aligned testing and debugging tools, integrated more seamlessly into the workflows of quantum developers. We present these results in detail and offer actionable recommendations grounded in the real-world needs of practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[MLDebugging: Towards Benchmarking Code Debugging Across Multi-Library Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13824v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code debugging is a crucial task in software engineering, which attracts increasing attention. While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios. We hope this work can uncover the potential of LLMs in multi-library debugging scenario and offer insights for future research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Hessian-Based Insights Support Fault Diagnosis in Attention-based Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07871v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity, diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis) and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |

However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, 34% of reported issues are quantum-specific, highlighting the need for specialized debugging tools beyond conventional software engineering approaches. This study provides empirical insights into the software engineering challenges of quantum computing, offering recommendations to improve development workflows, tooling, and documentation. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Identify Flakiness in C++ Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12340v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of regression testing in software testing is crucial as it ensures that any new modifications do not disrupt the existing functionality and behaviour of the software system. The desired outcome is for regression tests to yield identical results without any modifications made to the system being tested. In practice, however, the presence of Flaky Tests introduces non-deterministic behaviour and undermines the reliability of regression testing results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for identifying the root cause of flaky tests in C++ projects at the code level, with the intention of assisting developers in debugging and resolving them more efficiently. We compile a comprehensive collection of C++ project flaky tests sourced from GitHub repositories. We fine-tune Mistral-7b, Llama2-7b and CodeLlama-7b models on the C++ dataset and an existing Java dataset and evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We assess the performance of the models across various datasets and offer recommendations for both research and industry applications. The results indicate that our models exhibit varying performance on the C++ dataset, while their performance is comparable to that of the Java dataset. The Mistral-7b surpasses the other two models regarding all metrics, achieving a score of 1. Our results demonstrate the exceptional capability of LLMs to accurately classify flakiness in C++ and Java projects, providing a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of debugging flaky tests in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM-Based Fault Localization with External Memory and Project Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03585v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 7 figures |

However, existing debuggers are primarily tailored for human interaction, and those designed for programmatic debugging focus on kernel space, resulting in limited functionality in userland. To fill this gap, we introduce libdebug, a Python library for programmatic debugging of userland binary executables. libdebug offers a user-friendly API that enables developers to build custom debugging tools for various applications, including software engineering, reverse engineering, and software security. It is released as an open-source project, along with comprehensive documentation to encourage use and collaboration across the community. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of libdebug through case studies and benchmarks, all of which are publicly available. We find that the median latency of syscall and breakpoint handling in libdebug is 3 to 4 times lower compared to that of GDB.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAMBDA: A Large Model Based Data Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17535v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large language models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

This work introduces JITScope, an interactive visualization framework that illustrates how IR nodes and instructions evolve across compilation phases. The system features a full-stack architecture: a Python-based backend transforms raw JSON-formatted IR data-representing an abstract model of the JIT compiler IR-into a normalized SQLite database; a controller layer serves processed CSV data; and a D3.js-powered frontend renders an interactive, phase-aware graph of IR node transformations. The design emphasizes modularity, traceability, and flexibility. Our roadmap explores intuitive visual representations of phase-level changes in IR node connectivity, values, and access patterns. Ultimately, JITScope lays a foundation for future tooling that enables visual exploration of IR evolution, including phase filtering, value tracking, and function-access mapping-offering a new lens into the behaviors and impacts of compiler optimizations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 8 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional software, GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a unique corresponding event handler.</p></details> |  |

Virtual Platforms (VPs) have become indispensable tools for this purpose as they serve as a platform to execute and debug the unmodified target software at an early design stage. With the increasing complexity of software, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, VPs need to provide high simulation speed to ensure the target software executes within a reasonable time. Hybrid simulation, which combines virtual models with real hardware, can improve the performance of VPs. This paper introduces a novel approach for integrating real Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices into SystemC-TLM-2.0-based VPs. The embedded PCI devices enable high performance, easy integration, and allow introspection for analysis and optimization. To illustrate the practical application of our approach, we present a case study where we integrate Google Coral's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) into an ARM-based VP. The integration allows efficient execution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while eliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating AI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression testing across architectures, and device communication analysis. Our findings demonstrate that embedding PCI devices into SystemC simulations significantly enhances</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the 25th International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation (SAMOS XXV)</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Mutation-based Fault Localization for Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09059v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to execute operations. They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Better Understanding of Probabilistic Delta Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04735v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.</p></details> | accepted by ICSE25 |

Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[BugScope: Learn to Find Bugs Like Human](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15671v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting software bugs remains a fundamental challenge due to the extensive diversity of real-world defects. Traditional static analysis tools often rely on symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to customized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue to struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited analysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug patterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code auditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy behaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant detection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection prompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score. Further testing on large-scale open-source systems, including the Linux kernel, uncovered 141 previously unknown bugs, of which 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed by developers, highlighting BugScope's substantial practical impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |
| **[Input Reduction Enhanced LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15251v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program Repair (APR). Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of failures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR. Unfortunately, LLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts. When the test inputs are extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, compromising repair performance. To address this, we propose ReduceFix, an LLM-based APR approach with a built-in component that automatically reduces test inputs while retaining their failure-inducing behavior. ReduceFix prompts an LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs without human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to guide patch generation. For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB. On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair increases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes. Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Heuristic Guidance Based on Multiple Model Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15181v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning frameworks serve as the foundation for developing and deploying deep learning applications. To enhance the quality of deep learning frameworks, researchers have proposed numerous testing methods using deep learning models as test inputs. However, existing methods predominantly measure model bug detection effectiveness as heuristic indicators, presenting three critical limitations: Firstly, existing methods fail to quantitatively measure model's operator combination variety, potentially missing critical operator combinations that could trigger framework bugs. Secondly, existing methods neglect measuring model execution time, resulting in the omission of numerous models potential for detecting more framework bugs within limited testing time. Thirdly, existing methods overlook correlation between different model measurements, relying simply on single-indicator heuristic guidance without considering their trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DLMMM, the first deep learning framework testing method to include multiple model measurements into heuristic guidance and fuse these measurements to achieve their trade-off. DLMMM firstly quantitatively measures model's bug detection performance, operator combination variety, and model execution time. After that, DLMMM fuses the above measurements based on their correlation to achieve their trade-off. To further enhance testing effectiveness, DLMMM designs multi-level heuristic guidance for test input model generation.</p></details> |  |

Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[LibLMFuzz: LLM-Augmented Fuzz Target Generation for Black-box Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15058v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental problem in cybersecurity and computer science is determining whether a program is free of bugs and vulnerabilities. Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 2 listings</p></details> |

ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[LLM-Based Detection of Tangled Code Changes for Higher-Quality Method-Level Bug Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08263v2)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tangled code changes, commits that conflate unrelated modifications such as bug fixes, refactorings, and enhancements, introduce significant noise into bug datasets and adversely affect the performance of bug prediction models. Addressing this issue at a fine-grained, method-level granularity remains underexplored. This is critical to address, as recent bug prediction models, driven by practitioner demand, are increasingly focusing on finer granularity rather than traditional class- or file-level predictions. This study investigates the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting tangled code changes by leveraging both commit messages and method-level code diffs. We formulate the problem as a binary classification task and evaluate multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, using state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash. Our results demonstrate that combining commit messages with code diffs significantly enhances model performance, with the combined few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting achieving an F1-score of 0.88. Additionally, we explore machine learning models trained on LLM-generated embeddings, where a multi-layer perceptron classifier achieves superior performance (F1-score: 0.906, MCC: 0.807). Applying our approach to 49 open-source projects improves the distributional separability of code metrics between buggy and non-buggy methods, demonstrating the promise of LLMs for method-level commit untangling and potentially contributing to improving the accuracy of future bug prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing LLMs for Document-Guided Fuzzing of OpenCV Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14558v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of computer vision and artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming a broad spectrum of industries by enabling machines to interpret and act upon visual data with high levels of accuracy. As the biggest and by far the most popular open-source computer vision library, OpenCV library provides an extensive suite of programming functions supporting real-time computer vision. Bugs in the OpenCV library can affect the downstream computer vision applications, and it is critical to ensure the reliability of the OpenCV library. This paper introduces VISTAFUZZ, a novel technique for harnessing large language models (LLMs) for document-guided fuzzing of the OpenCV library. VISTAFUZZ utilizes LLMs to parse API documentation and obtain standardized API information. Based on this standardized information, VISTAFUZZ extracts constraints on individual input parameters and dependencies between these. Using these constraints and dependencies, VISTAFUZZ then generates new input values to systematically test each target API. We evaluate the effectiveness of VISTAFUZZ in testing 330 APIs in the OpenCV library, and the results show that VISTAFUZZ detected 17 new bugs, where 10 bugs have been confirmed, and 5 of these have been fixed.</p></details> |  |

Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.</p></details> |  |

However, little is known about their systematic biases or preferences toward certain libraries and programming languages, which can significantly impact software development practices. To fill this gap, we perform the first empirical study of LLMs' preferences for libraries and programming languages when generating code, covering eight diverse LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to overuse widely adopted libraries such as NumPy; in up to 48% of cases, this usage is unnecessary and deviates from the ground-truth solutions. LLMs also exhibit a significant preference toward Python as their default language. For high-performance project initialisation tasks where Python is not the optimal language, it remains the dominant choice in 58% of cases, and Rust is not used a single time. These results indicate that LLMs may prioritise familiarity and popularity over suitability and task-specific optimality. This will introduce security vulnerabilities and technical debt, and limit exposure to newly developed, better-suited tools and languages. Understanding and addressing these biases is essential for the responsible integration of LLMs into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures.

| **[ACFIX: Guiding LLMs with Mined Common RBAC Practices for Context-Aware Repair of Access Control Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06838v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical. While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined. Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check. To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them. This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Nanyang Technological University</p></details> |
| **[FaultLine: Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation Using LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15241v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the critical threat posed by software security vulnerabilities, reports are often incomplete, lacking the proof-of-vulnerability (PoV) tests needed to validate fixes and prevent regressions. These tests are crucial not only for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging problem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply nested levels of a program. We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully designed reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic program analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software project with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow of an input from an externally accessible API ("source") to the "sink" corresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an input must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along the flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a feedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or dynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming languages. To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100 known vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects. On this dataset, FaultLine is able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct 2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework. Thus, FaultLine represents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art. Our findings suggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents on PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging. We make our code and dataset publicly available in the hope that it will spur further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Clone Detection via an AlphaFold-Inspired Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15226v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection, which aims to identify functionally equivalent code fragments, plays a critical role in software maintenance and vulnerability analysis. Substantial methods have been proposed to detect code clones, but they fall short in capturing code semantics or relying on language-specific analyzers. Inspired by the remarkable success of AlphaFold in predicting three-dimensional protein structures from protein sequences, in this paper, we leverage AlphaFold for code clone detection based on the insight that protein sequences and token sequences share a common linear sequential structure. In particular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token sequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's sequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline of AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code fragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA from lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified attention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and across token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure prediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences through a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to determine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three language-diverse datasets demonstrate AlphaCC's applicability across multiple programming languages.

SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between coding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of mainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive capabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the challenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. However, existing code-generation benchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in generating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose SimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic code generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five representative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86 Advanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM Scalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a systematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18 representative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful findings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal decrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to scalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions for the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic code generation. SimdBench is fully open source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. STAR supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR exhibits superior effectiveness (10.5%-19.9% improvements) and efficiency (2.4-7.0 times speedup). In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figure, 8 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |

Existing tools detect such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under an open license to support reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)</p></details> |

Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 2 listings</p></details> |

However, no similar studies have been conducted for computational notebooks in the context of data science. To help bridge this research gap, we make three scientific contributions: we (1) introduce a toolset for collecting code changes in Jupyter notebooks during development time; (2) use it to collect more than 100 hours of work related to a data analysis task and a machine learning task (carried out by 20 developers with different levels of expertise), resulting in a dataset containing 2,655 cells and 9,207 cell executions; and (3) use this dataset to investigate the dynamic nature of the notebook development process and the changes that take place in the notebooks. In our analysis of the collected data, we classified the changes made to the cells between executions and found that a significant number of these changes were relatively small fixes and code iteration modifications. This suggests that notebooks are used not only as a development and exploration tool but also as a debugging tool. We report a number of other insights and propose potential future research directions on the novel data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[BugScope: Learn to Find Bugs Like Human](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15671v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting software bugs remains a fundamental challenge due to the extensive diversity of real-world defects. Traditional static analysis tools often rely on symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to customized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue to struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited analysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug patterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code auditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy behaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant detection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection prompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score. Further testing on large-scale open-source systems, including the Linux kernel, uncovered 141 previously unknown bugs, of which 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed by developers, highlighting BugScope's substantial practical impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |
| **[Modeling CubeSat Storage Battery Discharge: Equivalent Circuit Versus Machine Learning Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15666v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The subject of the article is the study and comparison of two approaches to modelling the battery discharge of a CubeSat satellite: analytical using equivalent circuit and machine learning. The article aims to make a reasoned choice of the approach to modelling the battery discharge of a CubeSat satellite. Modelling the battery discharge of a satellite will enable the prediction of the consequences of disconnecting the autonomous power system and ensure the fault tolerance of equipment in orbit. Therefore, the selected study is relevant and promising. This study focuses on the analysis of CubeSat satellite data, based explicitly on orbital data samples of the power system, which include data available at the time of the article publication. The dataset contains data on the voltage, current, and temperature of the battery and solar panels attached to the five sides of the satellite. In this context, two approaches are considered: analytical modelling based on physical laws and machine learning, which uses empirical data to create a predictive model. Results: A comparative analysis of the modeling results reveals that the equivalent circuit approach has the advantage of transparency, as it identifies possible parameters that facilitate understanding of the relationships. However, the model is less flexible to environmental changes or non-standard satellite behavior. The machine learning model demonstrated more accurate results, as it can account for complex dependencies and adapt to actual conditions, even when they deviate from theoretical assumptions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability. Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models. Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model. Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts. Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.</p></details> |  |

Although recent studies have shown the popularity and advantages of React in web development, the specific challenges users face remain unknown. Thus, this study aims to analyse the React-related questions shared on Stack Overflow. The study utilizes an exploratory data analysis to investigate the most frequently discussed keywords, error classification, and user reputation-based errors, which is the novelty of this work. The results show the top eight most frequently used keywords on React-related questions, namely, code, link, vir, href, connect, azure, windows, and website. The error classification of questions from the sample shows that algorithmic error is the most frequent issue faced by all groups of users, where mid-reputation users contribute the most, accounting for 55.77%. This suggests the need for the community to provide guidance materials in solving algorithm-related problems. We expect that the results of this study will provide valuable insight into future research to support the React community during the early stages of implementation, facilitating their ability to effectively overcome challenges to adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Applying the Chinese Wall Reverse Engineering Technique to Large Language Model Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15599v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code (Code LLM) are increasingly utilized in programming environments. Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of LLMs' Preferences for Libraries and Programming Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17181v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, influencing users' choices of libraries and programming languages in critical real-world projects. However, little is known about their systematic biases or preferences toward certain libraries and programming languages, which can significantly impact software development practices. To fill this gap, we perform the first empirical study of LLMs' preferences for libraries and programming languages when generating code, covering eight diverse LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to overuse widely adopted libraries such as NumPy; in up to 48% of cases, this usage is unnecessary and deviates from the ground-truth solutions. LLMs also exhibit a significant preference toward Python as their default language. For high-performance project initialisation tasks where Python is not the optimal language, it remains the dominant choice in 58% of cases, and Rust is not used a single time. These results indicate that LLMs may prioritise familiarity and popularity over suitability and task-specific optimality. This will introduce security vulnerabilities and technical debt, and limit exposure to newly developed, better-suited tools and languages. Understanding and addressing these biases is essential for the responsible integration of LLMs into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures.

Graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning addresses this by translating the structural information into contextual cues that the LLM can understand. However, current methods are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information, they fall short in preserving the rich semantic information (e.g., control/data flow) within code graphs. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while capturing graph-text interactions in their cross-modal alignment module. This paper presents CGP-Tuning, a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection. CGP-Tuning introduces type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with an efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational costs while incorporating graph-text interactions. It is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and three advanced open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeGemma, and Qwen2.5-Coder. Experimental results show that CGP-Tuning delivers model-agnostic improvements and maintains practical inference speed, surpassing the best graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning baseline by an average of four percentage points and outperforming non-tuned zero-shot prompting by 15 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

However, practitioners face significant challenges when making RAG deployment decisions. While existing research prioritizes algorithmic innovations, a systematic gap persists in understanding fundamental engineering trade-offs that determine RAG success. We present the first comprehensive study of three universal RAG deployment decisions: whether to deploy RAG, how much information to retrieve, and how to integrate retrieved knowledge effectively. Through systematic experiments across three LLMs and six datasets spanning question answering and code generation tasks, we reveal critical insights: (1) RAG deployment must be highly selective, with variable recall thresholds and failure modes affecting up to 12.6\% of samples even with perfect documents. (2) Optimal retrieval volume exhibits task-dependent behavior QA tasks show universal patterns (5-10 documents optimal) while code generation requires scenario-specific optimization. (3) Knowledge integration effectiveness depends on task and model characteristics, with code generation benefiting significantly from prompting methods while question answering shows minimal improvement. These findings demonstrate that universal RAG strategies prove inadequate. Effective RAG systems require context-aware design decisions based on task characteristics and model capabilities. Our analysis provides evidence-based guidance for practitioners and establishes foundational insights for principled RAG deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, despite its remarkable capabilities and the substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still has some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to effectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or deterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown automata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using stacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs. Unlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans explicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This design maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention. Specifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and popping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both Chomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse tasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and other baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B parameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M outperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters, showcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under development</p></details> |

The discovery of the XZ Utils backdoor intensified these concerns because of the potential widespread impact. This study, therefore, explores the challenges of preventing and detecting malware in Linux distribution package repositories. To do so, we ask two research questions: (1) What measures have Linux distributions implemented to counter malware, and how have maintainers experienced these efforts? (2) How effective are current malware detection tools in identifying malicious Linux packages? To answer these questions, we conduct interviews with maintainers at several major Linux distributions and introduce a Linux package malware benchmark dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of six open-source malware detection scanners. Distribution maintainers, according to the interviews, have mostly focused on reproducible builds to date. Our interviews identified only a single Linux distribution, Wolfi OS, that performs active malware scanning. Using this new benchmark dataset, the evaluation found that the performance of existing open-source malware scanners is underwhelming. Most studied tools excel at producing false positives but only infrequently detect true malware. Those that avoid high false positive rates often do so at the expense of a satisfactory true positive. Our findings provide insights into Linux distribution package repositories' current practices for malware detection and demonstrate the current inadequacy of open-source tools designed to detect malicious Linux packages.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of this paradigm is limited due to the issue of parameter failure during its execution. To explore this phenomenon and propose corresponding suggestions, we first construct a parameter failure taxonomy in this paper. We derive five failure categories from the invocation chain of a mainstream tool agent. Then, we explore the correlation between three different input sources and failure categories by applying 15 input perturbation methods to the input. Experimental results show that parameter name hallucination failure primarily stems from inherent LLM limitations, while issues with input sources mainly cause other failure patterns. To improve the reliability and effectiveness of tool-agent interactions, we propose corresponding improvement suggestions, including standardizing tool return formats, improving error feedback mechanisms, and ensuring parameter consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Input Reduction Enhanced LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15251v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program Repair (APR). Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of failures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR. Unfortunately, LLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts. When the test inputs are extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, compromising repair performance. To address this, we propose ReduceFix, an LLM-based APR approach with a built-in component that automatically reduces test inputs while retaining their failure-inducing behavior. ReduceFix prompts an LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs without human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to guide patch generation. For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB. On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair increases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes. Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACFIX: Guiding LLMs with Mined Common RBAC Practices for Context-Aware Repair of Access Control Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06838v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical. While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined. Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check. To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them. This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Nanyang Technological University</p></details> |
| **[FaultLine: Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation Using LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15241v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the critical threat posed by software security vulnerabilities, reports are often incomplete, lacking the proof-of-vulnerability (PoV) tests needed to validate fixes and prevent regressions. These tests are crucial not only for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging problem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply nested levels of a program. We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully designed reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic program analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software project with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow of an input from an externally accessible API ("source") to the "sink" corresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an input must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along the flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a feedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or dynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming languages. To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100 known vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects. On this dataset, FaultLine is able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct 2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework. Thus, FaultLine represents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art. Our findings suggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents on PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging.

Substantial methods have been proposed to detect code clones, but they fall short in capturing code semantics or relying on language-specific analyzers. Inspired by the remarkable success of AlphaFold in predicting three-dimensional protein structures from protein sequences, in this paper, we leverage AlphaFold for code clone detection based on the insight that protein sequences and token sequences share a common linear sequential structure. In particular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token sequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's sequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline of AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code fragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA from lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified attention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and across token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure prediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences through a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to determine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three language-diverse datasets demonstrate AlphaCC's applicability across multiple programming languages. On two semantic clone detection datasets, it consistently outperforms all baselines, showing strong semantic understanding. Moreover, AlphaCC maintains competitive efficiency, enabling practical usage in large-scale clone detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between coding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of mainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive capabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the challenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. However, existing code-generation benchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in generating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose SimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic code generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five representative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86 Advanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM Scalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a systematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18 representative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful findings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal decrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to scalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions for the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic code generation. SimdBench is fully open source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader research community.</p></details> |  |

This systematic mapping study (SMS) aims to explore the most recent studies and to cover recent changes in trends, especially related to the recent evolution of Generative AI approaches. Our SMS covers the period between April 2023 and April 2025. We identified 22 relevant publications and analysed persona representation, construction, validation, as well as RE activities covered by personas. We identified that a number of studies applied AI-based solutions for persona construction and validation. We observed that template-based personas are becoming more popular nowadays. We also observed an increase in the proportion of studies covering validation aspects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cultural Impact on Requirements Engineering Activities: Bangladeshi Practitioners' View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15188v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements Engineering (RE) is one of the most interaction-intensive phases of software development. This means that RE activities might be especially impacted by stakeholders' national culture. Software development projects increasingly have a very diverse range of stakeholders. To future-proof RE activities, we need to help RE practitioners avoid misunderstandings and conflicts that might arise from not understanding potential Cultural Influences (CIs). Moreover, an awareness of CIs supports diversity and inclusion in the IT profession. Bangladesh has a growing IT sector with some unique socio-cultural characteristics, and has been largely overlooked in this research field. In this study, we aim to investigate how the RE process is adopted in the context of Bangladeshi culture and what cultural influences impact overall RE activities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Heuristic Guidance Based on Multiple Model Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15181v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning frameworks serve as the foundation for developing and deploying deep learning applications. To enhance the quality of deep learning frameworks, researchers have proposed numerous testing methods using deep learning models as test inputs. However, existing methods predominantly measure model bug detection effectiveness as heuristic indicators, presenting three critical limitations: Firstly, existing methods fail to quantitatively measure model's operator combination variety, potentially missing critical operator combinations that could trigger framework bugs. Secondly, existing methods neglect measuring model execution time, resulting in the omission of numerous models potential for detecting more framework bugs within limited testing time. Thirdly, existing methods overlook correlation between different model measurements, relying simply on single-indicator heuristic guidance without considering their trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DLMMM, the first deep learning framework testing method to include multiple model measurements into heuristic guidance and fuse these measurements to achieve their trade-off. DLMMM firstly quantitatively measures model's bug detection performance, operator combination variety, and model execution time. After that, DLMMM fuses the above measurements based on their correlation to achieve their trade-off. To further enhance testing effectiveness, DLMMM designs multi-level heuristic guidance for test input model generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Generate User Stories and Assess Their Quality?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15157v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements elicitation is still one of the most challenging activities of the requirements engineering process due to the difficulty requirements analysts face in understanding and translating complex needs into concrete requirements. In addition, specifying high-quality requirements is crucial, as it can directly impact the quality of the software to be developed. Although automated tools allow for assessing the syntactic quality of requirements, evaluating semantic metrics (e.g., language clarity, internal consistency) remains a manual and time-consuming activity. This paper explores how LLMs can help automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where requirements are defined as user stories (US). We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs to investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer interviews. We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with the quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). We also explored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the semantic quality of US. Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar to humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower diversity and creativity. Although LLM-generated US are generally comparable in quality to those created by humans, they tend to meet the acceptance quality criteria less frequently, regardless of the scale of the LLM model. Finally, LLMs can reliably assess the semantic quality of US when provided with clear evaluation criteria and have the potential to reduce human effort in large-scale assessments.</p></details> |  |

Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. STAR supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR exhibits superior effectiveness (10.5%-19.9% improvements) and efficiency (2.4-7.0 times speedup). In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figure, 8 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |

Existing tools detect such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under an open license to support reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)</p></details> |

Verifying specific input-output properties can be a highly challenging task due to the lack of a single, self-contained framework that allows a complete range of verification types. To this end, we present \texttt{ModelVerification.jl (MV)}, the first comprehensive, cutting-edge toolbox that contains a suite of state-of-the-art methods for verifying different types of DNNs and safety specifications. This versatile toolbox is designed to empower developers and machine learning practitioners with robust tools for verifying and ensuring the trustworthiness of their DNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LibLMFuzz: LLM-Augmented Fuzz Target Generation for Black-box Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15058v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental problem in cybersecurity and computer science is determining whether a program is free of bugs and vulnerabilities. Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 2 listings</p></details> |

Automotive software development is considered to be a significant area for GenAI adoption, taking into account lengthy and expensive procedures, resulting from the amount of requirements and strict standardization. In this paper, we explore the adoption of GenAI for various steps of automotive software development, mainly focusing on requirements handling, compliance aspects and code generation. Three GenAI-related technologies are covered within the state-of-art: Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Vision Language Models (VLMs), as well as overview of adopted prompting techniques in case of code generation. Additionally, we also derive a generalized GenAI-aided automotive software development workflow based on our findings from this literature review. Finally, we include a summary of a survey outcome, which was conducted among our automotive industry partners regarding the type of GenAI tools used for their daily work activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper accepted for GACLM 2025</p></details> |

The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>Intermediate preprint (revision #1) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[The Rise of AI Teammates in Software Engineering (SE) 3.0: How Autonomous Coding Agents Are Reshaping Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15003v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The future of software engineering--SE 3.0--is unfolding with the rise of AI teammates: autonomous, goal-driven systems collaborating with human developers. Among these, autonomous coding agents are especially transformative, now actively initiating, reviewing, and evolving code at scale. This paper introduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents operate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading agents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across 61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented empirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development. Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software engineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in benchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI governance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review timelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond synthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often outperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a trust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code submission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in three years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics). We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for the SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev enables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports building the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration.

This rise exposes users to significant new security and privacy challenges due to sociotechnical complexity, pervasive connectivity, and extensive user data collection in immersive environments. We present a systematic review of the literature published between 2013 and 2024, offering a comprehensive analysis of how the research community has addressed metaverse-related security and privacy issues over the past decade. We organize the studies by method, examined the security and privacy properties, immersive components, and evaluation strategies. Our investigation reveals a sharp increase in research activity in the last five years, a strong focus on practical and user-centered approaches, and a predominant use of benchmarking, human experimentation, and qualitative methods. Authentication and unobservability are the most frequently studied properties. However, critical gaps remain in areas such as policy compliance, accessibility, interoperability, and back-end infrastructure security. We emphasize the intertwined technical complexity and human factors of the metaverse and call for integrated, interdisciplinary approaches to securing inclusive and trustworthy immersive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted for publication at Computers & Security Journal</p></details> |
| **[Think Like an Engineer: A Neuro-Symbolic Collaboration Agent for Generative Software Requirements Elicitation and Self-Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14969v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vision of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) is to empower non-professional users with full control over the software development lifecycle. It aims to enable users to drive generative software development using only natural language requirements. However, since end-users often lack knowledge of software engineering, their requirement descriptions are frequently ambiguous, raising significant challenges to generative software development. Although existing approaches utilize structured languages like Gherkin to clarify user narratives, they still struggle to express the causal logic between preconditions and behavior actions. This paper introduces RequireCEG, a requirement elicitation and self-review agent that embeds causal-effect graphs (CEGs) in a neuro-symbolic collaboration architecture. RequireCEG first uses a feature tree to analyze user narratives hierarchically, clearly defining the scope of software components and their system behavior requirements. Next, it constructs the self-healing CEGs based on the elicited requirements, capturing the causal relationships between atomic preconditions and behavioral actions. Finally, the constructed CEGs are used to review and optimize Gherkin scenarios, ensuring consistency between the generated Gherkin requirements and the system behavior requirements elicited from user narratives. To evaluate our method, we created the RGPair benchmark dataset and conducted extensive experiments. It achieves an 87% coverage rate and raises diversity by 51.88%.</p></details> |  |

ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[Flexible Process Variant Binding in Information Systems with Software Product Line Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17689v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different organisations often run similar digitised business processes to achieve their business goals. However, organisations often need to slightly adapt the business processes implemented in an information system in order to adopt them. Various approaches have been proposed to manage variants in process models. While these approaches mainly deal with control flow variability, in previous work we introduced an approach to manage implementation variants of digitised business processes. In this context Software Product Line (SPL) Engineering was applied to manage a set of common core artefacts including a process model from which Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS) can be derived, which differ in the implementation of their process activities. When deriving a PAIS, implementations are selected for each process activity and then included in the PAIS at compilation time. One challenge that has not yet been solved is giving users of digitised business processes the option of selecting multiple implementations at runtime. This paper extends our previous work by not only allowing for the selection of activity implementations at compile time, but also at start time and runtime. Consequently, it becomes possible to defer the decision as to which implementation should be selected to start time and runtime. Furthermore, multiple implementations of a particular activity may be selected and executed concurrently. The presented approach also allows customising the input and output data of activities. Data from expert interviews with German municipalities suggests digitising business processes with varying implementations is a widespread challenge and our approach is a way to mitigate it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Extracting Software Requirements from App Reviews using Seq2seq Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09039v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile app reviews are a large-scale data source for software improvements. A key task in this context is effectively extracting requirements from app reviews to analyze the users' needs and support the software's evolution. Recent studies show that existing methods fail at this task since app reviews usually contain informal language, grammatical and spelling errors, and a large amount of irrelevant information that might not have direct practical value for developers. To address this, we propose a novel reformulation of requirements extraction as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task based on the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) generation approach. With this aim, we propose a Seq2seq framework, incorporating a BiLSTM encoder and an LSTM decoder, enhanced with a self-attention mechanism, GloVe embeddings, and a CRF model. We evaluated our framework on two datasets: a manually annotated set of 1,000 reviews (Dataset 1) and a crowdsourced set of 23,816 reviews (Dataset 2). The quantitative evaluation of our framework showed that it outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods with an F1 score of 0.96 on Dataset 2, and achieved comparable performance on Dataset 1 with an F1 score of 0.47.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE: A Context-Aware Approach for Mining Privacy Requirements Relevant Reviews from Mental Health Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09051v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental health (MH) apps often require sensitive user data to customize services for mental wellness needs. However, such data collection practices in some MH apps raise significant privacy concerns for users. These concerns are often mentioned in app reviews, but other feedback categories, such as reliability and usability, tend to take precedence. This poses a significant challenge in automatically identifying privacy requirements-relevant reviews (privacy reviews) that can be utilized to extract privacy requirements and address users' privacy concerns. Thus, this study introduces SAGE, a context-aware approach to automatically mining privacy reviews from MH apps using Natural Language Inference (NLI) with MH domain-specific privacy hypotheses (provides domain-specific context awareness) and a GPT model (eliminates the need for fine-tuning). The quantitative evaluation of SAGE on a dataset of 204K app reviews achieved an F1 score of 0.85 without any fine-tuning, outperforming the fine-tuned baseline classifiers BERT and T5. Furthermore, SAGE extracted 748 privacy reviews previously overlooked by keyword-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness through qualitative evaluation. These reviews can later be refined into actionable privacy requirement artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2507.09049</p></details> |
| **[CMER: A Context-Aware Approach for Mining Ethical Concern-related App Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09049v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing proliferation of mobile applications in our daily lives, the concerns surrounding ethics have surged significantly. Users communicate their feedback in app reviews, frequently emphasizing ethical concerns, such as privacy and security. Incorporating these reviews has proved to be useful for many areas of software engineering (e.g., requirement engineering, testing, etc.). However, app reviews related to ethical concerns generally use domain-specific language and are typically overshadowed by more generic categories of user feedback, such as app reliability and usability. Thus, making automated extraction a challenging and time-consuming effort. This study proposes CMER (A \underline{C}ontext-Aware Approach for \underline{M}ining \underline{E}thical Concern-related App \underline{R}eviews), a novel approach that combines Natural Language Inference (NLI) and a decoder-only (LLaMA-like) Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ethical concern-related app reviews at scale. In CMER, NLI provides domain-specific context awareness by using domain-specific hypotheses, and the Llama-like LLM eliminates the need for labeled data in the classification task. We evaluated the validity of CMER by mining privacy and security-related reviews (PSRs) from the dataset of more than 382K app reviews of mobile investment apps. First, we evaluated four NLI models and compared the results of domain-specific hypotheses with generic hypotheses. Next, we evaluated three LLMs for the classification task. Finally, we combined the best NLI and LLM models (CMER) and extracted 2,178 additional PSRs overlooked by the previous study using a keyword-based approach, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of CMER. These reviews can be further refined into actionable requirement artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.07398</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Repository-Level Code Generation with Call Chain-Aware Multi-View Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14791v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code generation aims to generate code within the context of a specified repository. Existing approaches typically employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to provide LLMs with relevant contextual information extracted from the repository. However, these approaches often struggle with effectively identifying truly relevant contexts that capture the rich semantics of the repository, and their contextual perspectives remains narrow. Moreover, most approaches fail to account for the structural relationships in the retrieved code during prompt construction, hindering the LLM's ability to accurately interpret the context. To address these issues, we propose RepoScope, which leverages call chain-aware multi-view context for repository-level code generation. RepoScope constructs a Repository Structural Semantic Graph (RSSG) and retrieves a comprehensive four-view context, integrating both structural and similarity-based contexts. We propose a novel call chain prediction method that utilizes the repository's structural semantics to improve the identification of callees in the target function. Additionally, we present a structure-preserving serialization algorithm for prompt construction, ensuring the coherence of the context for the LLM. Notably, RepoScope relies solely on static analysis, eliminating the need for additional training or multiple LLM queries, thus ensuring both efficiency and generalizability. Evaluation on widely-used repository-level code generation benchmarks (CoderEval and DevEval) demonstrates that RepoScope outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 36.35% relative improvement in pass@1 scores. Further experiments emphasize RepoScope's potential to improve code generation across different tasks and its ability to integrate effectively with existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriOpt: PPA-Aware High-Quality Verilog Generation via Multi-Role LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14776v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models(LLMs) in hardware design has primarily focused on generating functionally correct Verilog code, overlooking critical Power Performance-Area(PPA) metrics essential for industrial-grade designs. To bridge this gap, we propose VeriOpt, a novel framework that leverages role-based prompting and PPA-aware optimization to enable LLMs to produce high-quality, synthesizable Verilog. VeriOpt structures LLM interactions into specialized roles (e.g., Planner, Programmer, Reviewer, Evaluator) to emulate human design workflows, while integrating PPA constraints directly into the prompting pipeline. By combining multi-modal feedback (e.g., synthesis reports, timing diagrams) with PPA aware prompting, VeriOpt achieves PPA-efficient code generation without sacrificing functional correctness. Experimental results demonstrate up to 88% reduction in power, 76% reduction in area and 73% improvement in timing closure compared to baseline LLM-generated RTL, validated using industry standard EDA tools. At the same time achieves 86% success rate in functionality evaluation. Our work advances the state-of-the-art AI-driven hardware design by addressing the critical gap between correctness and quality, paving the way for reliable LLM adoption in production workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, Accepted for ICCAD 2025, Munich, Germany</p></details> |
| **[Toward Inclusive AI-Driven Development: Exploring Gender Differences in Code Generation Tool Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14770v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The increasing reliance on Code Generation Tools (CGTs), such as Windsurf and GitHub Copilot, are revamping programming workflows and raising critical questions about fairness and inclusivity. While CGTs offer potential productivity enhancements, their effectiveness across diverse user groups have not been sufficiently investigated. Objectives: We hypothesize that developers' interactions with CGTs vary based on gender, influencing task outcomes and cognitive load, as prior research suggests that gender differences can affect technology use and cognitive processing. Methods: The study will employ a mixed-subjects design with 54 participants, evenly divided by gender for a counterbalanced design. Participants will complete two programming tasks (medium to hard difficulty) with only CGT assistance and then with only internet access. Task orders and conditions will be counterbalanced to mitigate order effects. Data collection will include cognitive load surveys, screen recordings, and task performance metrics such as completion time, code correctness, and CGT interaction behaviors. Statistical analyses will be conducted to identify statistically significant differences in CGT usage. Expected Contributions: Our work can uncover gender differences in CGT interaction and performance among developers. Our findings can inform future CGT designs and help address usability and potential disparities in interaction patterns across diverse user groups. Conclusion: While results are not yet available, our proposal lays the groundwork for advancing fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE) in CGT design. The outcomes are anticipated to contribute to inclusive AI practices and equitable tool development for all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>ESEM ...</summary><p>ESEM 2025 Registered Reports</p></details> |
| **[Investigating the Role of LLMs Hyperparameter Tuning and Prompt Engineering to Support Domain Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14735v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has enhanced automation in software engineering tasks, including in Model Driven Engineering (MDE). However, using general-purpose LLMs for domain modeling has its limitations. One approach is to adopt fine-tuned models, but this requires significant computational resources and can lead to issues like catastrophic forgetting. This paper explores how hyperparameter tuning and prompt engineering can improve the accuracy of the Llama 3.1 model for generating domain models from textual descriptions. We use search-based methods to tune hyperparameters for a specific medical data model, resulting in a notable quality improvement over the baseline LLM. We then test the optimized hyperparameters across ten diverse application domains. While the solutions were not universally applicable, we demonstrate that combining hyperparameter tuning with prompt engineering can enhance results across nearly all examined domain models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 51st Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA)</p></details> |

The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging. In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of fundamental competencies as well as values that define the general profile of an RSE. On this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different dimensions, looking at specific types of RSE roles, proposing recommendations for organisations, and giving examples of future specialisations. An appendix details how existing curricula fit into this framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, public repository for feedback here: https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/competencies</p></details> |

Despite the availability of method history generation tools such as CodeShovel and CodeTracker, existing evaluations of their effectiveness are limited by inaccuracies in the ground truth oracles used. In this study, we systematically construct two new oracles -- the corrected CodeShovel oracle and a newly developed HistoryFinder oracle -- by combining automated analysis with expert-guided manual validation. We also introduce HistoryFinder, a new method history generation tool designed to improve not only the accuracy and completeness of method change histories but also to offer competitive runtime performance. Through extensive evaluation across 400 methods from 40 open-source repositories, we show that HistoryFinder consistently outperforms CodeShovel, CodeTracker, IntelliJ, and Git-based baselines in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, HistoryFinder achieves competitive runtime performance, offering the lowest mean and median execution times among all the research-based tools. While Git-based tools exhibit the fastest runtimes, this efficiency comes at the cost of significantly lower precision and recall -- leaving HistoryFinder as the best overall choice when both accuracy and efficiency are important. To facilitate adoption, we provide a web interface, CLI, and Java library for flexible usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Detection of Tangled Code Changes for Higher-Quality Method-Level Bug Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08263v2)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tangled code changes, commits that conflate unrelated modifications such as bug fixes, refactorings, and enhancements, introduce significant noise into bug datasets and adversely affect the performance of bug prediction models. Addressing this issue at a fine-grained, method-level granularity remains underexplored. This is critical to address, as recent bug prediction models, driven by practitioner demand, are increasingly focusing on finer granularity rather than traditional class- or file-level predictions. This study investigates the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting tangled code changes by leveraging both commit messages and method-level code diffs. We formulate the problem as a binary classification task and evaluate multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, using state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash. Our results demonstrate that combining commit messages with code diffs significantly enhances model performance, with the combined few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting achieving an F1-score of 0.88. Additionally, we explore machine learning models trained on LLM-generated embeddings, where a multi-layer perceptron classifier achieves superior performance (F1-score: 0.906, MCC: 0.807). Applying our approach to 49 open-source projects improves the distributional separability of code metrics between buggy and non-buggy methods, demonstrating the promise of LLMs for method-level commit untangling and potentially contributing to improving the accuracy of future bug prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Algorithm for Generating Minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC Test cases for Singular Boolean Expressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14687v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) is a mandatory structural coverage criterion for ensuring the reliability and safety of critical systems. While its strictest form, Unique-Cause MC/DC, offers the highest assurance, research on its efficient test generation has been lacking. This gap is particularly significant, as an analysis of large-scale avionics systems shows that 99.7% of all conditional decisions are, in fact, Singular Boolean Expressions (SBEs) the ideal structure for applying Unique-Cause MC/DC. This paper proposes 'Robin's Rule', a deterministic algorithm that directly constructs a minimal test set of N + 1 cases to guarantee 100% Unique-Cause MC/DC for SBEs with N conditions, without generating a full truth table. To validate our approach, we constructed a benchmark by reformulating the TCAS-II specifications into SBEs and verified the results using an industry-standard, certified commercial tool. The results confirm that our method consistently achieves 100% coverage with the theoretical minimum number of tests and is more efficient than the commercial tool. This work provides a practical and provably optimal solution for verifying safety-critical systems, ensuring both rigor and efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Efficient Story Point Estimation With Comparative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14642v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Story point estimation is an essential part of agile software development. Story points are unitless, project-specific effort estimates that help developers plan their sprints. Traditionally, developers estimate story points collaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the initial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team has converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious and labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with enough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is, state-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate predictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The goal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a comparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story point prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to every backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate which item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine learning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically evaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects. The model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground truth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of a regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the proposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art regression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments - providing comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than providing ratings or categorical labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[A first look at License Variants in the PyPI Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14594v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source licenses establish the legal foundation for software reuse, yet license variants, including both modified standard licenses and custom-created alternatives, introduce significant compliance complexities. Despite their prevalence and potential impact, these variants are poorly understood in modern software systems, and existing tools do not account for their existence, leading to significant challenges in both effectiveness and efficiency of license analysis. To fill this knowledge gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of license variants in the PyPI ecosystem. Our findings show that textual variations in licenses are common, yet only 2% involve substantive modifications. However, these license variants lead to significant compliance issues, with 10.7% of their downstream dependencies found to be license-incompatible. Inspired by our findings, we introduce LV-Parser, a novel approach for efficient license variant analysis leveraging diff-based techniques and large language models, along with LV-Compat, an automated pipeline for detecting license incompatibilities in software dependency networks. Our evaluation demonstrates that LV-Parser achieves an accuracy of 0.936 while reducing computational costs by 30%, and LV-Compat identifies 5.2 times more incompatible packages than existing methods with a precision of 0.98. This work not only provides the first empirical study into license variants in software packaging ecosystem but also equips developers and organizations with practical tools for navigating the complex landscape of open-source licensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing LLMs for Document-Guided Fuzzing of OpenCV Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14558v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of computer vision and artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming a broad spectrum of industries by enabling machines to interpret and act upon visual data with high levels of accuracy. As the biggest and by far the most popular open-source computer vision library, OpenCV library provides an extensive suite of programming functions supporting real-time computer vision. Bugs in the OpenCV library can affect the downstream computer vision applications, and it is critical to ensure the reliability of the OpenCV library. This paper introduces VISTAFUZZ, a novel technique for harnessing large language models (LLMs) for document-guided fuzzing of the OpenCV library. VISTAFUZZ utilizes LLMs to parse API documentation and obtain standardized API information. Based on this standardized information, VISTAFUZZ extracts constraints on individual input parameters and dependencies between these. Using these constraints and dependencies, VISTAFUZZ then generates new input values to systematically test each target API. We evaluate the effectiveness of VISTAFUZZ in testing 330 APIs in the OpenCV library, and the results show that VISTAFUZZ detected 17 new bugs, where 10 bugs have been confirmed, and 5 of these have been fixed.</p></details> |  |

With the rise of cloud computing, microservices, and containers, architectural practices have diversified. Understanding these shifts is vital. This study analyzes software architecture trends across eight leading industry conferences over five years. We investigate the evolution of software architecture by analyzing talks from top practitioner conferences, focusing on the motivations and contexts driving technology adoption. We analyzed 5,677 talks from eight major industry conferences, using large language models and expert validation to extract technologies, their purposes, and usage contexts. We also explored how technologies interrelate and fit within DevOps and deployment pipelines. Among 450 technologies, Kubernetes, Cloud Native, Serverless, and Containers dominate by frequency and centrality. Practitioners present technology mainly related to deployment, communication, AI, and observability. We identify five technology communities covering automation, coordination, cloud AI, monitoring, and cloud-edge. Most technologies span multiple DevOps stages and support hybrid deployment. Our study reveals that a few core technologies, like Kubernetes and Serverless, dominate the contemporary software architecture practice. These are mainly applied in later DevOps stages, with limited focus on early phases like planning and coding. We also show how practitioners frame technologies by purpose and context, reflecting evolving industry priorities. Finally, we observe how only research can provide a more holistic lens on architectural design, quality, and evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Architectural Degradation: Definition, Motivations, Measurement and Remediation Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14547v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Architectural degradation, also known as erosion, decay, or aging, impacts system quality, maintainability, and adaptability. Although widely acknowledged, current literature shows fragmented definitions, metrics, and remediation strategies. Our study aims to unify understanding of architectural degradation by identifying its definitions, causes, metrics, tools, and remediation approaches across academic and gray literature. We conducted a multivocal literature review of 108 studies extracting definitions, causes, metrics, measurement approaches, tools, and remediation strategies. We developed a taxonomy encompassing architectural, code, and process debt to explore definition evolution, methodological trends, and research gaps. Architectural degradation has shifted from a low-level issue to a socio-technical concern. Definitions now address code violations, design drift, and structural decay. Causes fall under architectural (e.g., poor documentation), code (e.g., hasty fixes), and process debt (e.g., knowledge loss). We identified 54 metrics and 31 measurement techniques, focused on smells, cohesion/coupling, and evolution. Yet, most tools detect issues but rarely support ongoing or preventive remediation. Degradation is both technical and organizational. While detection is well-studied, continuous remediation remains lacking. Our study reveals missed integration between metrics, tools, and repair logic, urging holistic, proactive strategies for sustainable architecture.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Effect of Token Merging on Pre-trained Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14423v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization is a fundamental component of language models for code. It involves breaking down the input into units that are later passed to the language model stack to learn high-dimensional representations used in various contexts, from classification to generation. However, the output of these tokenizers is often longer than that traditionally used in compilers and interpreters. This could result in undesirable effects, such as increased computational overhead. In this work, we investigate the effect of merging the hidden representations of subtokens that belong to the same semantic unit, such as subtokens that form a single identifier. We propose two strategies: one based on averaging the representations and another that leverages a learning-based approach. Both methods can be seamlessly integrated with existing language models for code. We conduct experiments using six language models for code: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXCoder, CdoeT5, CodeT5+ (220M), and CodeT5+ (770M), across three software engineering tasks: vulnerability detection, code classification, and code translation. Results show that these strategies can reduce the number of floating-point operations by $1\%$ to $19\%$. Regarding downstream performance, the most significant degradation was observed in the vulnerability detection task, where the F1 score decreased by $1.82$ points compared to the baseline. In contrast, for code translation, we observed an improvement of $2.47$ points in CodeBLEU. This work contributes to the broader effort of improving language models for code across multiple dimensions, including both computational efficiency and downstream performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM Code Generation with Ensembles: A Similarity-Based Selection Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15838v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble learning has been widely used in machine learning to improve model robustness, accuracy, and generalization, but has not yet been applied to code generation tasks with large language models (LLMs). We propose an ensemble approach for LLMs in code generation. Instead of relying on the output of a single model, we generate multiple candidate programs from different LLMs and apply a structured voting mechanism to select the most reliable solution. For voting, we compute syntactic and semantic similarity using CodeBLEU and behavioral equivalence using CrossHair's differential behavior analysis. By aggregating these similarity scores, we select the program that best aligns with the consensus among the candidates. We show through experiments that our ensemble approach consistently outperforms standalone LLMs on the well-known HumanEval and the more challenging LiveCodeBench datasets, achieving an accuracy of 90.2% and 50.2%, respectively, on the two datasets. In comparison, the best-performing LLM (GPT-4o) has an accuracy of 83.5% and 43.4%, respectively. Furthermore, even when restricted to free open-source models, our method achieves an accuracy of 80.5% and 41.6%, respectively, demonstrating the viability of our approach in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Developing Shared Vocabulary System For Collaborative Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14396v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective communication is a critical factor in successful software engineering collaboration. However, communication gaps remain a persistent challenge, often leading to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, and defects. This research investigates the technical factors contributing to such misunderstandings and explores the measurable benefits of establishing shared vocabulary systems within software documentation and codebases. Using a Design Science Research (DSR) framework, the study was structured into three iterative phases: problem identification, method development, and empirical validation. The problem identification phase involved thematic analysis of communication data and semi-structured interviews, revealing key factors such as ambiguous messaging, misalignment in documentation, inconsistent code review feedback, and API integration miscommunication. Grounded Theory principles were employed to design a structured methodology for collaborative vocabulary development. Empirical validation through controlled experiments demonstrated that while initial adoption introduced overhead, the shared vocabulary system significantly improved information density, documentation clarity, and collaboration efficiency over time. Findings offer actionable insights for improving communication practices in software engineering, while also identifying limitations and directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, including appendix</p></details> |

This paper examines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve existing ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this potential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains (metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to solve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote Assistance or Remote Driving: The Impact of Operational Design Domains on ADS-Supporting Systems Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14347v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High level Automated Driving Systems (ADS) can handle many situations, but they still encounter situations where human intervention is required. In systems where a physical driver is present in the vehicle, typically SAE Level 3 systems, this intervention is relatively straightforward and is handled by the in-vehicle driver. However, the complexity increases for Level 4 systems, where, in most cases, no physical driver remains in the vehicle. The two common industry solutions for this challenge are the integration of a remote support system, such as a Remote Driving System (RDS) or Remote Assistance System (RAS). While it is clear that ADS will require one of these systems, it is less clear how the suitability of either system for a particular ADS application should be evaluated. Currently, the selection process often focuses on system architecture as well as its design and integration challenges. Furthermore, since many ADS developers choose to develop remote system solutions in-house, it is advantageous to select the simpler approach to streamline development and integration efforts. While these decision points are certainly relevant, this approach overlooks the most critical factors: the use cases and the complementarity of the ADS and the remote support system within the context of the Operational Design Design Domain (ODD). This paper proposes a structured approach for selecting between RDS and RAS as an ADS support system, based on the defined ODD and use case analysis. To achieve this, the paper applies the PEGASUS framework to systematically describe and analyze the ODD. A structured framework is introduced to evaluate and select the most suitable remote support system for an ADS based on clearly defined criteria.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Tools such as model-checkers and theorem provers ensure software correctness by verifying the implementation against the specification. Formal methods deployment is regularly enforced in the development of safety-critical systems e.g. aerospace, medical devices and autonomous systems. Generating these specifications from informal and ambiguous natural language requirements remains the key challenge. Our project, VERIFAI^{1}, aims to investigate automated and semi-automated approaches to bridge this gap, using techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), ontology-based domain modelling, artefact reuse, and large language models (LLMs).

While the link between fairness and job satisfaction has been established in other fields, its relevance to software professionals remains underexplored. This study examines how fairness perceptions relate to job satisfaction among software practitioners, focusing on both general trends and demographic-specific differences. We conducted an online survey of 108 software practitioners, followed by ordinal logistic regression to analyze the relationship between fairness perceptions and job satisfaction in software engineering contexts, with moderation analysis examining how this relationship varies across demographic groups. Our findings indicate that all four fairness dimensions (namely distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational fairness) significantly affect overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with job security. Among these, interpersonal fairness has the biggest impact. The relationship between fairness and job satisfaction is stronger for female, ethnically underrepresented, less experienced practitioners, and those with work limitations. Fairness in authorship emerged as an important factor for job satisfaction collectively, while fairness in policy implementation, high-demand situations, and working hours impacted specific demographic groups. This study highlights the role of fairness among software practitioners, offering strategies for organizations to promote fair practices and targeted approaches for certain demographic groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the ACM for possible publication</p></details> |

OpenCAMS is designed to support advanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by combining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides large-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D perception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables modular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized, bidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation progression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while preserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and render a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control logic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and traffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to both mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside units) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the foundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and future-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this core without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture. The OpenCAMS platform is fully open-source and publicly available through its GitHub repository https://github.com/minhaj6/carla-sumo-omnetpp-cosim, providing the research community with an accessible, flexible, and collaborative environment for advancing next-generation intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Code Context and Prompting Strategies on Automated Unit Test Generation with Modern General-Purpose Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14256v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI is gaining increasing attention in software engineering, where testing remains an indispensable reliability mechanism. According to the widely adopted testing pyramid, unit tests constitute the majority of test cases and are often schematic, requiring minimal domain expertise. Automatically generating such tests under the supervision of software engineers can significantly enhance productivity during the development phase of the software lifecycle. This paper investigates the impact of code context and prompting strategies on the quality and adequacy of unit tests generated by various large language models (LLMs) across several families. The results show that including docstrings notably improves code adequacy, while further extending context to the full implementation yields definitely smaller gains. Notably, the chain-of-thought prompting strategy -- applied even to 'reasoning' models -- achieves the best results, with up to 96.3\% branch coverage, a 57\% average mutation score, and near-perfect compilation success rate. Among the evaluated models, M5 (Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrated superior performance in both mutation score and branch coverage being still in top in terms of compilation success rate. All the code and resulting test suites are publicly available at https://github.com/peetery/LLM-analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, little is known about the readability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from practitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables, Accepted at ICSME</p></details> |
| **[Testing Autonomous Driving Systems -- What Really Matters and What Doesn't](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13661v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive research, the testing of autonomous driving systems (ADS) landscape remains fragmented, and there is currently no basis for an informed technical assessment of the importance and contribution of the current state of the art. This paper attempts to address this problem by exploring two complementary aspects. First, it proposes a framework for comparing existing test methods in terms of their intrinsic effectiveness and validity. It shows that many methods do not meet both of these requirements. Either because they are based on criteria that do not allow for rapid, inexpensive, and comprehensive detection of failures, or because the degree of validity of the properties tested cannot be accurately estimated. In particular, it is shown that most critical test methods do not take into account the nominal operational capabilities of autopilots and generate scenarios that are impossible for the tested vehicles to handle, resulting in unjustified rejections. Secondly, the paper shows that test effectiveness and validity are highly dependent on how autopilots are designed: how they choose between different control policies to perform maneuvers, as well as on the reproducibility of the results. In fact, most test methods take for granted two principles underlying traditional methods, but do not generally apply to ADS. We maintain that the absence of rationality and determinacy significantly impairs the effectiveness and validity of test methods, and provide test results on eight open autopilots, in which most do not satisfy these properties, thereby illustrating this fact. We conclude that under the current state of the art, it is impossible to obtain strong enough guarantees for essential autopilot properties and recommend that autopilots be developed with a view to both rationality and determinacy.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the transformative potential of integrating Large Language Models into Multi-Agent (LMA) systems for addressing complex challenges in software engineering (SE). By leveraging the collaborative and specialized abilities of multiple agents, LMA systems enable autonomous problem-solving, improve robustness, and provide scalable solutions for managing the complexity of real-world software projects. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of recent primary studies to map the current landscape of LMA applications across various stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). To illustrate current capabilities and limitations, we perform two case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art LMA frameworks. Additionally, we identify critical research gaps and propose a comprehensive research agenda focused on enhancing individual agent capabilities and optimizing agent synergy. Our work outlines a forward-looking vision for developing fully autonomous, scalable, and trustworthy LMA systems, laying the foundation for the evolution of Software Engineering 2.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>TOSEM...</summary><p>TOSEM 2030 Special Issue</p></details> |

We present ParaStudent, a systematic study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional, and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns, incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at https://github.com/mmiroyan/ParaStudent.</p></details> |  |

At the core of chatbots are Natural Language Understanding platforms (NLUs), which enable them to comprehend user queries but require labeled data for training. However, acquiring such labeled data for SE chatbots is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets, as training requires specialized vocabulary and phrases not found in typical language datasets. Consequently, developers often resort to manually annotating user queries -- a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Previous approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling functions (LFs), that categorize queries based on specific patterns. To address this issue, we propose an approach to automatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We evaluate our approach on four SE datasets and measure performance improvement from training NLUs on queries labeled by the generated LFs. The generated LFs effectively label data with AUC scores up to 85.3% and NLU performance improvements up to 27.2%. Furthermore, our results show that the number of LFs affects labeling performance. We believe that our approach can save time and resources in labeling users' queries, allowing practitioners to focus on core chatbot functionalities rather than manually labeling queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology for review</p></details> |

Along with this growth, fast-paced market changes have led to constantly evolving software requirements. Such requirements are often grounded in feature requests and enhancement suggestions, typically provided by users in natural language (NL). However, these requests often suffer from defects such as ambiguity and incompleteness, making them challenging to interpret. Traditional validation methods (e.g., interviews and workshops) help clarify such defects but are impractical in decentralized environments like open-source software (OSS), where change requests originate from diverse users on platforms like GitHub. This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and refine NL defects in feature requests. Our approach automates the identification of ambiguous and incomplete requests and generates clarification questions (CQs) to enhance their usefulness for developers. To evaluate its effectiveness, we apply our method to real-world OSS feature requests and compare its performance against human annotations. In addition, we conduct interviews with GitHub developers to gain deeper insights into their perceptions of NL defects, the strategies they use to address these defects, and the impact of defects on downstream software engineering (SE) tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Better Requirements from the Crowd: Developer Engagement with Feature Requests in Open Source Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13553v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As user demands evolve, effectively incorporating feature requests is crucial for maintaining software relevance and user satisfaction. Feature requests, typically expressed in natural language, often suffer from ambiguity or incomplete information due to communication gaps or the requester's limited technical expertise. These issues can lead to misinterpretation, faulty implementation, and reduced software quality. While seeking clarification from requesters is a common strategy to mitigate these risks, little is known about how developers engage in this clarification process in practice-how they formulate clarifying questions, seek technical or contextual details, align on goals and use cases, or decide to close requests without attempting clarification. This study investigates how feature requests are prone to NL defects (i.e. ambiguous or incomplete) and the conversational dynamics of clarification in open-source software (OSS) development, aiming to understand how developers handle ambiguous or incomplete feature requests. Our findings suggest that feature requests published on the OSS platforms do possess ambiguity and incompleteness, and in some cases, both. We also find that explicit clarification for the resolution of these defects is uncommon; developers usually focus on aligning with project goals rather than resolving unclear text. When clarification occurs, it emphasizes understanding user intent/goal and feasibility, rather than technical details. By characterizing the dynamics of clarification in open-source issue trackers, this work identifies patterns that can improve user-developer collaboration and inform best practices for handling feature requests effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 9th International Workshop on Crowd-Based Requirements Engineering (CrowdRE'25)</p></details> |
| **[AI-Assisted Fixes to Code Review Comments at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13499v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aim. There are 10s of thousands of code review comments each week at Meta. We developed Metamate for Code Review (MetaMateCR) that provides AI-assisted fixes for reviewer comments in production at scale. Method. We developed an internal benchmark of 64k <review comment, patch> data points to fine-tune Llama models. Once our models achieve reasonable offline results, we roll them into production. To ensure that our AI-assisted fixes do not negatively impact the time it takes to do code reviews, we conduct randomized controlled safety trials as well as full production experiments. Offline Results. As a baseline, we compare GPT-4o to our small and large Llama models. In offline results, our LargeLSFT model creates an exact match patch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The internal models also use more modern Hack functions when compared to the PHP functions suggested by GPT-4o. Safety Trial. When we roll MetaMateCR into production in a safety trial that compares no AI patches with AI patch suggestions, we see a large regression with reviewers taking over 5% longer to conduct reviews. After investigation, we modify the UX to only show authors the AI patches, and see no regressions in the time for reviews. Production. When we roll LargeLSFT into production, we see an ActionableToApplied rate of 19.7%, which is a 9.2pp improvement over GPT-4o. Our results illustrate the importance of safety trials in ensuring that AI does not inadvertently slow down engineers, and a successful review comment to AI patch product running at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Socio-Technical Smell Dynamics in Code Samples: A Multivocal Review on Emergence, Evolution, and Co-Occurrence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13481v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code samples play a pivotal role in open-source ecosystems (OSSECO), serving as lightweight artifacts that support knowledge transfer, onboarding, and framework adoption. Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are often governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which increases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the co-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes, poor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented communication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been studied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions anticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This study investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve within code samples maintained in OSSECOs. A Multivocal Literature Review protocol was applied, encompassing 30 peer-reviewed papers and 17 practitioner-oriented sources (2013-2024). Thematic synthesis was conducted to identify recurring socio-technical patterns related to smell dynamics. Nine patterns were identified, showing that community smells often precede or reinforce technical degradation in code samples. Symptoms such as "radio silence" and centralized ownership were frequently associated with persistent structural anomalies. Additionally, limited onboarding, the absence of continuous refactoring, and informal collaboration emerged as recurring conditions for smell accumulation. Conclusion: In OSSECOs, particularly within code samples, community-level dysfunctions not only correlate with but often signal maintainability decay. These findings underscore the need for socio-technical quality indicators and lightweight governance mechanisms tailored to shared instructional artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages; 2 figures; Preprint with the original submission accepted for publication at 39th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)</p></details> |

Recent studies have uncovered severe data contamination issues, e.g. SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches involve direct solution leakage and 31.08% pass due to inadequate test cases. We introduce SWE-MERA, a dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to address these fundamental challenges through an automated collection of real-world GitHub issues and rigorous quality validation. Our approach implements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality while minimizing contamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential tasks with 300 samples currently available. Evaluation using the Aider coding agent demonstrates strong discriminative power in state-of-the-art models. We report performance across a dozen recent LLMs evaluated on tasks collected between September 2024 and June 2025.</p></details> |  |

However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises several new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code provenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly concerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments. Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial samples. This module effectively enhances the model's resistance against diverse adversarial attacks. Experimental results on the HMCorp dataset demonstrate that CodeGPTSensor+ significantly improves detection accuracy on the adversarial test set while maintaining high accuracy on the original test set, showcasing superior robustness compared to CodeGPTSensor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring Attributed Grammars from Parser Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13117v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems that process structured inputs often lack complete and up-to-date specifications, which specify the input syntax and the semantics of input processing. While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering syntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring attributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our technique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers to reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in specifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program executions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we systematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This enables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately reproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |

The trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Unlike traditional software systems governed by deterministic logic, systems powered by pretrained models exhibit distinctive and emergent characteristics, such as ambiguous capability boundaries, context-dependent behavior, and continuous evolution. These properties fundamentally challenge long-standing assumptions in requirements engineering, including functional decomposability and behavioral predictability. This paper investigates this problem and advocates for a rethinking of existing requirements engineering methodologies. We propose a conceptual framework tailored to requirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled software systems and outline several promising research directions within this framework. This vision helps provide a guide for researchers and practitioners to tackle the emerging challenges in requirements engineering of pretrained-model-enabled systems.</p></details> | 5pages, 1 figure |

Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family, specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.</p></details> |  |

It involves collaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address potential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently, multi-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention. However, existing research provides limited support for requirements development and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the human-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development, named iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents to support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform various tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses on integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world stakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an artifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger the next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new requirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to support human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align with the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and results show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects. We further envision three key directions and hope this work can facilitate the development of intelligent requirements development.</p></details> | 22pages, 4 figures |
| **[Write Your Own CodeChecker: An Automated Test-Driven Checker Development Approach with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06796v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rising demand for code quality assurance, developers are not only utilizing existing static code checkers but also seeking custom checkers to satisfy their specific needs. Nowadays, various code-checking frameworks provide extensive checker customization interfaces to meet this need. However, both the abstract checking logic and the complex API usage of large-scale checker frameworks make this task challenging. To this end, automated code checker generation is anticipated to ease the burden of checker development. In this paper, we propose AutoChecker, an innovative LLM-powered approach that can write code checkers automatically based on only a rule description and a test suite. To achieve comprehensive checking logic, AutoChecker incrementally updates the checker's logic by focusing on solving one selected case each time. To obtain precise API knowledge, during each iteration, it leverages fine-grained logic-guided API-context retrieval, where it first decomposes the checking logic into a series of sub-operations and then retrieves checker-related API-contexts for each sub-operation. For evaluation, we apply AutoChecker, five baselines, and three ablation methods using multiple LLMs to generate checkers for 20 randomly selected PMD rules. Experimental results show that AutoChecker significantly outperforms others across all effectiveness metrics, with an average test pass rate of 82.28%. Additionally, the checkers generated by AutoChecker can be successfully applied to real-world projects, matching the performance of official checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update metadata and artifact url</p></details> |

However, these test cases often suffer from test smells, quality issues such as ambiguity, redundancy, or missing checks that reduce test reliability and maintainability. While detection tools exist, they typically require manual rule definition and lack scalability. This study investigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically detecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143 real-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4 achieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond detection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even without explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven identification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule definitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of SLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Accepted at Insightful Ideas and Emerging Results (IIER) Track of the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES 2025)</p></details> |

Traditional static analysis tools often rely on symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to customized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue to struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited analysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug patterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code auditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy behaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant detection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection prompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score. Further testing on large-scale open-source systems, including the Linux kernel, uncovered 141 previously unknown bugs, of which 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed by developers, highlighting BugScope's substantial practical impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability. Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models. Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model. Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts. Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Input Reduction Enhanced LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15251v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program Repair (APR). Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of failures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR. Unfortunately, LLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts. When the test inputs are extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, compromising repair performance. To address this, we propose ReduceFix, an LLM-based APR approach with a built-in component that automatically reduces test inputs while retaining their failure-inducing behavior. ReduceFix prompts an LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs without human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to guide patch generation. For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB. On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair increases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes. Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaultLine: Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation Using LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15241v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the critical threat posed by software security vulnerabilities, reports are often incomplete, lacking the proof-of-vulnerability (PoV) tests needed to validate fixes and prevent regressions. These tests are crucial not only for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging problem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply nested levels of a program. We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully designed reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic program analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software project with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow of an input from an externally accessible API ("source") to the "sink" corresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an input must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along the flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a feedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or dynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming languages. To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100 known vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects. On this dataset, FaultLine is able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct 2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework. Thus, FaultLine represents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art. Our findings suggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents on PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging. We make our code and dataset publicly available in the hope that it will spur further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Heuristic Guidance Based on Multiple Model Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15181v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning frameworks serve as the foundation for developing and deploying deep learning applications. To enhance the quality of deep learning frameworks, researchers have proposed numerous testing methods using deep learning models as test inputs. However, existing methods predominantly measure model bug detection effectiveness as heuristic indicators, presenting three critical limitations: Firstly, existing methods fail to quantitatively measure model's operator combination variety, potentially missing critical operator combinations that could trigger framework bugs. Secondly, existing methods neglect measuring model execution time, resulting in the omission of numerous models potential for detecting more framework bugs within limited testing time. Thirdly, existing methods overlook correlation between different model measurements, relying simply on single-indicator heuristic guidance without considering their trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DLMMM, the first deep learning framework testing method to include multiple model measurements into heuristic guidance and fuse these measurements to achieve their trade-off. DLMMM firstly quantitatively measures model's bug detection performance, operator combination variety, and model execution time. After that, DLMMM fuses the above measurements based on their correlation to achieve their trade-off. To further enhance testing effectiveness, DLMMM designs multi-level heuristic guidance for test input model generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Generate User Stories and Assess Their Quality?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15157v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements elicitation is still one of the most challenging activities of the requirements engineering process due to the difficulty requirements analysts face in understanding and translating complex needs into concrete requirements. In addition, specifying high-quality requirements is crucial, as it can directly impact the quality of the software to be developed. Although automated tools allow for assessing the syntactic quality of requirements, evaluating semantic metrics (e.g., language clarity, internal consistency) remains a manual and time-consuming activity. This paper explores how LLMs can help automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where requirements are defined as user stories (US). We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs to investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer interviews. We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with the quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). We also explored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the semantic quality of US. Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar to humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower diversity and creativity. Although LLM-generated US are generally comparable in quality to those created by humans, they tend to meet the acceptance quality criteria less frequently, regardless of the scale of the LLM model. Finally, LLMs can reliably assess the semantic quality of US when provided with clear evaluation criteria and have the potential to reduce human effort in large-scale assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design of an Edge-based Portable EHR System for Anemia Screening in Remote Health Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15146v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of medical systems for remote, resource-limited environments faces persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support, and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference 2025</p></details> |

Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 2 listings</p></details> |
| **[Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>Intermediate preprint (revision #1) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[Learning Software Bug Reports: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04422v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has significantly impacted software engineering research, including bug report analysis. ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[CMER: A Context-Aware Approach for Mining Ethical Concern-related App Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09049v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing proliferation of mobile applications in our daily lives, the concerns surrounding ethics have surged significantly. Users communicate their feedback in app reviews, frequently emphasizing ethical concerns, such as privacy and security. Incorporating these reviews has proved to be useful for many areas of software engineering (e.g., requirement engineering, testing, etc.). However, app reviews related to ethical concerns generally use domain-specific language and are typically overshadowed by more generic categories of user feedback, such as app reliability and usability. Thus, making automated extraction a challenging and time-consuming effort. This study proposes CMER (A \underline{C}ontext-Aware Approach for \underline{M}ining \underline{E}thical Concern-related App \underline{R}eviews), a novel approach that combines Natural Language Inference (NLI) and a decoder-only (LLaMA-like) Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ethical concern-related app reviews at scale. In CMER, NLI provides domain-specific context awareness by using domain-specific hypotheses, and the Llama-like LLM eliminates the need for labeled data in the classification task. We evaluated the validity of CMER by mining privacy and security-related reviews (PSRs) from the dataset of more than 382K app reviews of mobile investment apps. First, we evaluated four NLI models and compared the results of domain-specific hypotheses with generic hypotheses. Next, we evaluated three LLMs for the classification task. Finally, we combined the best NLI and LLM models (CMER) and extracted 2,178 additional PSRs overlooked by the previous study using a keyword-based approach, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of CMER. These reviews can be further refined into actionable requirement artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.07398</p></details> |
| **[Investigating the Role of LLMs Hyperparameter Tuning and Prompt Engineering to Support Domain Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14735v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has enhanced automation in software engineering tasks, including in Model Driven Engineering (MDE). However, using general-purpose LLMs for domain modeling has its limitations. One approach is to adopt fine-tuned models, but this requires significant computational resources and can lead to issues like catastrophic forgetting. This paper explores how hyperparameter tuning and prompt engineering can improve the accuracy of the Llama 3.1 model for generating domain models from textual descriptions. We use search-based methods to tune hyperparameters for a specific medical data model, resulting in a notable quality improvement over the baseline LLM. We then test the optimized hyperparameters across ten diverse application domains. While the solutions were not universally applicable, we demonstrate that combining hyperparameter tuning with prompt engineering can enhance results across nearly all examined domain models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 51st Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA)</p></details> |

Despite the availability of method history generation tools such as CodeShovel and CodeTracker, existing evaluations of their effectiveness are limited by inaccuracies in the ground truth oracles used. In this study, we systematically construct two new oracles -- the corrected CodeShovel oracle and a newly developed HistoryFinder oracle -- by combining automated analysis with expert-guided manual validation. We also introduce HistoryFinder, a new method history generation tool designed to improve not only the accuracy and completeness of method change histories but also to offer competitive runtime performance. Through extensive evaluation across 400 methods from 40 open-source repositories, we show that HistoryFinder consistently outperforms CodeShovel, CodeTracker, IntelliJ, and Git-based baselines in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, HistoryFinder achieves competitive runtime performance, offering the lowest mean and median execution times among all the research-based tools. While Git-based tools exhibit the fastest runtimes, this efficiency comes at the cost of significantly lower precision and recall -- leaving HistoryFinder as the best overall choice when both accuracy and efficiency are important. To facilitate adoption, we provide a web interface, CLI, and Java library for flexible usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Algorithm for Generating Minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC Test cases for Singular Boolean Expressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14687v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) is a mandatory structural coverage criterion for ensuring the reliability and safety of critical systems. While its strictest form, Unique-Cause MC/DC, offers the highest assurance, research on its efficient test generation has been lacking. This gap is particularly significant, as an analysis of large-scale avionics systems shows that 99.7% of all conditional decisions are, in fact, Singular Boolean Expressions (SBEs) the ideal structure for applying Unique-Cause MC/DC. This paper proposes 'Robin's Rule', a deterministic algorithm that directly constructs a minimal test set of N + 1 cases to guarantee 100% Unique-Cause MC/DC for SBEs with N conditions, without generating a full truth table. To validate our approach, we constructed a benchmark by reformulating the TCAS-II specifications into SBEs and verified the results using an industry-standard, certified commercial tool. The results confirm that our method consistently achieves 100% coverage with the theoretical minimum number of tests and is more efficient than the commercial tool. This work provides a practical and provably optimal solution for verifying safety-critical systems, ensuring both rigor and efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[BugScope: Learn to Find Bugs Like Human](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15671v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting software bugs remains a fundamental challenge due to the extensive diversity of real-world defects. Traditional static analysis tools often rely on symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to customized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue to struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited analysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug patterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code auditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy behaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant detection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection prompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score. Further testing on large-scale open-source systems, including the Linux kernel, uncovered 141 previously unknown bugs, of which 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed by developers, highlighting BugScope's substantial practical impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |

Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of LLMs' Preferences for Libraries and Programming Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17181v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, influencing users' choices of libraries and programming languages in critical real-world projects. However, little is known about their systematic biases or preferences toward certain libraries and programming languages, which can significantly impact software development practices. To fill this gap, we perform the first empirical study of LLMs' preferences for libraries and programming languages when generating code, covering eight diverse LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to overuse widely adopted libraries such as NumPy; in up to 48% of cases, this usage is unnecessary and deviates from the ground-truth solutions. LLMs also exhibit a significant preference toward Python as their default language. For high-performance project initialisation tasks where Python is not the optimal language, it remains the dominant choice in 58% of cases, and Rust is not used a single time. These results indicate that LLMs may prioritise familiarity and popularity over suitability and task-specific optimality. This will introduce security vulnerabilities and technical debt, and limit exposure to newly developed, better-suited tools and languages. Understanding and addressing these biases is essential for the responsible integration of LLMs into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures.

| **[CGP-Tuning: Structure-Aware Soft Prompt Tuning for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04510v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs. However, existing fine-tuning techniques often treat source code as plain text, losing the graph-based structural information inherent in code. Graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning addresses this by translating the structural information into contextual cues that the LLM can understand. However, current methods are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information, they fall short in preserving the rich semantic information (e.g., control/data flow) within code graphs. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while capturing graph-text interactions in their cross-modal alignment module. This paper presents CGP-Tuning, a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection. CGP-Tuning introduces type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with an efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational costs while incorporating graph-text interactions. It is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and three advanced open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeGemma, and Qwen2.5-Coder. Experimental results show that CGP-Tuning delivers model-agnostic improvements and maintains practical inference speed, surpassing the best graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning baseline by an average of four percentage points and outperforming non-tuned zero-shot prompting by 15 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

However, practitioners face significant challenges when making RAG deployment decisions. While existing research prioritizes algorithmic innovations, a systematic gap persists in understanding fundamental engineering trade-offs that determine RAG success. We present the first comprehensive study of three universal RAG deployment decisions: whether to deploy RAG, how much information to retrieve, and how to integrate retrieved knowledge effectively. Through systematic experiments across three LLMs and six datasets spanning question answering and code generation tasks, we reveal critical insights: (1) RAG deployment must be highly selective, with variable recall thresholds and failure modes affecting up to 12.6\% of samples even with perfect documents. (2) Optimal retrieval volume exhibits task-dependent behavior QA tasks show universal patterns (5-10 documents optimal) while code generation requires scenario-specific optimization. (3) Knowledge integration effectiveness depends on task and model characteristics, with code generation benefiting significantly from prompting methods while question answering shows minimal improvement. These findings demonstrate that universal RAG strategies prove inadequate. Effective RAG systems require context-aware design decisions based on task characteristics and model capabilities. Our analysis provides evidence-based guidance for practitioners and establishes foundational insights for principled RAG deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[StackTrans: From Large Language Model to Large Pushdown Automata Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15343v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transformer architecture has emerged as a landmark advancement within the broad field of artificial intelligence, effectively catalyzing the advent of large language models (LLMs). However, despite its remarkable capabilities and the substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still has some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to effectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or deterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown automata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using stacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs. Unlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans explicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This design maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention. Specifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and popping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both Chomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse tasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and other baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B parameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M outperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters, showcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under development</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of this paradigm is limited due to the issue of parameter failure during its execution. To explore this phenomenon and propose corresponding suggestions, we first construct a parameter failure taxonomy in this paper. We derive five failure categories from the invocation chain of a mainstream tool agent. Then, we explore the correlation between three different input sources and failure categories by applying 15 input perturbation methods to the input. Experimental results show that parameter name hallucination failure primarily stems from inherent LLM limitations, while issues with input sources mainly cause other failure patterns. To improve the reliability and effectiveness of tool-agent interactions, we propose corresponding improvement suggestions, including standardizing tool return formats, improving error feedback mechanisms, and ensuring parameter consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Input Reduction Enhanced LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15251v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program Repair (APR). Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of failures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR. Unfortunately, LLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts. When the test inputs are extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, compromising repair performance. To address this, we propose ReduceFix, an LLM-based APR approach with a built-in component that automatically reduces test inputs while retaining their failure-inducing behavior. ReduceFix prompts an LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs without human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to guide patch generation. For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB. On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair increases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes. Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACFIX: Guiding LLMs with Mined Common RBAC Practices for Context-Aware Repair of Access Control Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06838v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical. While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined. Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check. To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them. This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Nanyang Technological University</p></details> |
| **[FaultLine: Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation Using LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15241v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the critical threat posed by software security vulnerabilities, reports are often incomplete, lacking the proof-of-vulnerability (PoV) tests needed to validate fixes and prevent regressions. These tests are crucial not only for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging problem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply nested levels of a program. We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully designed reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic program analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software project with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow of an input from an externally accessible API ("source") to the "sink" corresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an input must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along the flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a feedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or dynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming languages. To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100 known vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects. On this dataset, FaultLine is able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct 2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework. Thus, FaultLine represents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art. Our findings suggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents on PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging. We make our code and dataset publicly available in the hope that it will spur further research in this area.</p></details> |  |

SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between coding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of mainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive capabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the challenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. However, existing code-generation benchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in generating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose SimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic code generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five representative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86 Advanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM Scalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a systematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18 representative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful findings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal decrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to scalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions for the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic code generation. SimdBench is fully open source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Generate User Stories and Assess Their Quality?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15157v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements elicitation is still one of the most challenging activities of the requirements engineering process due to the difficulty requirements analysts face in understanding and translating complex needs into concrete requirements. In addition, specifying high-quality requirements is crucial, as it can directly impact the quality of the software to be developed. Although automated tools allow for assessing the syntactic quality of requirements, evaluating semantic metrics (e.g., language clarity, internal consistency) remains a manual and time-consuming activity. This paper explores how LLMs can help automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where requirements are defined as user stories (US). We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs to investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer interviews. We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with the quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). We also explored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the semantic quality of US. Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar to humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower diversity and creativity. Although LLM-generated US are generally comparable in quality to those created by humans, they tend to meet the acceptance quality criteria less frequently, regardless of the scale of the LLM model. Finally, LLMs can reliably assess the semantic quality of US when provided with clear evaluation criteria and have the potential to reduce human effort in large-scale assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. STAR supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR exhibits superior effectiveness (10.5%-19.9% improvements) and efficiency (2.4-7.0 times speedup). In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figure, 8 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |

Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 2 listings</p></details> |

Automotive software development is considered to be a significant area for GenAI adoption, taking into account lengthy and expensive procedures, resulting from the amount of requirements and strict standardization. In this paper, we explore the adoption of GenAI for various steps of automotive software development, mainly focusing on requirements handling, compliance aspects and code generation. Three GenAI-related technologies are covered within the state-of-art: Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Vision Language Models (VLMs), as well as overview of adopted prompting techniques in case of code generation. Additionally, we also derive a generalized GenAI-aided automotive software development workflow based on our findings from this literature review. Finally, we include a summary of a survey outcome, which was conducted among our automotive industry partners regarding the type of GenAI tools used for their daily work activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper accepted for GACLM 2025</p></details> |

Users communicate their feedback in app reviews, frequently emphasizing ethical concerns, such as privacy and security. Incorporating these reviews has proved to be useful for many areas of software engineering (e.g., requirement engineering, testing, etc.). However, app reviews related to ethical concerns generally use domain-specific language and are typically overshadowed by more generic categories of user feedback, such as app reliability and usability. Thus, making automated extraction a challenging and time-consuming effort. This study proposes CMER (A \underline{C}ontext-Aware Approach for \underline{M}ining \underline{E}thical Concern-related App \underline{R}eviews), a novel approach that combines Natural Language Inference (NLI) and a decoder-only (LLaMA-like) Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ethical concern-related app reviews at scale. In CMER, NLI provides domain-specific context awareness by using domain-specific hypotheses, and the Llama-like LLM eliminates the need for labeled data in the classification task. We evaluated the validity of CMER by mining privacy and security-related reviews (PSRs) from the dataset of more than 382K app reviews of mobile investment apps. First, we evaluated four NLI models and compared the results of domain-specific hypotheses with generic hypotheses. Next, we evaluated three LLMs for the classification task. Finally, we combined the best NLI and LLM models (CMER) and extracted 2,178 additional PSRs overlooked by the previous study using a keyword-based approach, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of CMER. These reviews can be further refined into actionable requirement artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.07398</p></details> |

Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |

Traditional static analysis tools often rely on symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to customized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue to struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited analysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug patterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code auditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy behaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant detection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection prompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score. Further testing on large-scale open-source systems, including the Linux kernel, uncovered 141 previously unknown bugs, of which 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed by developers, highlighting BugScope's substantial practical impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |

The article aims to make a reasoned choice of the approach to modelling the battery discharge of a CubeSat satellite. Modelling the battery discharge of a satellite will enable the prediction of the consequences of disconnecting the autonomous power system and ensure the fault tolerance of equipment in orbit. Therefore, the selected study is relevant and promising. This study focuses on the analysis of CubeSat satellite data, based explicitly on orbital data samples of the power system, which include data available at the time of the article publication. The dataset contains data on the voltage, current, and temperature of the battery and solar panels attached to the five sides of the satellite. In this context, two approaches are considered: analytical modelling based on physical laws and machine learning, which uses empirical data to create a predictive model. Results: A comparative analysis of the modeling results reveals that the equivalent circuit approach has the advantage of transparency, as it identifies possible parameters that facilitate understanding of the relationships. However, the model is less flexible to environmental changes or non-standard satellite behavior. The machine learning model demonstrated more accurate results, as it can account for complex dependencies and adapt to actual conditions, even when they deviate from theoretical assumptions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability. Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models. Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model. Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts. Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.</p></details> |  |

Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.</p></details> |  |

However, little is known about their systematic biases or preferences toward certain libraries and programming languages, which can significantly impact software development practices. To fill this gap, we perform the first empirical study of LLMs' preferences for libraries and programming languages when generating code, covering eight diverse LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to overuse widely adopted libraries such as NumPy; in up to 48% of cases, this usage is unnecessary and deviates from the ground-truth solutions. LLMs also exhibit a significant preference toward Python as their default language. For high-performance project initialisation tasks where Python is not the optimal language, it remains the dominant choice in 58% of cases, and Rust is not used a single time. These results indicate that LLMs may prioritise familiarity and popularity over suitability and task-specific optimality. This will introduce security vulnerabilities and technical debt, and limit exposure to newly developed, better-suited tools and languages. Understanding and addressing these biases is essential for the responsible integration of LLMs into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures.

Graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning addresses this by translating the structural information into contextual cues that the LLM can understand. However, current methods are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information, they fall short in preserving the rich semantic information (e.g., control/data flow) within code graphs. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while capturing graph-text interactions in their cross-modal alignment module. This paper presents CGP-Tuning, a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection. CGP-Tuning introduces type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with an efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational costs while incorporating graph-text interactions. It is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and three advanced open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeGemma, and Qwen2.5-Coder. Experimental results show that CGP-Tuning delivers model-agnostic improvements and maintains practical inference speed, surpassing the best graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning baseline by an average of four percentage points and outperforming non-tuned zero-shot prompting by 15 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

However, no similar studies have been conducted for computational notebooks in the context of data science. To help bridge this research gap, we make three scientific contributions: we (1) introduce a toolset for collecting code changes in Jupyter notebooks during development time; (2) use it to collect more than 100 hours of work related to a data analysis task and a machine learning task (carried out by 20 developers with different levels of expertise), resulting in a dataset containing 2,655 cells and 9,207 cell executions; and (3) use this dataset to investigate the dynamic nature of the notebook development process and the changes that take place in the notebooks. In our analysis of the collected data, we classified the changes made to the cells between executions and found that a significant number of these changes were relatively small fixes and code iteration modifications. This suggests that notebooks are used not only as a development and exploration tool but also as a debugging tool. We report a number of other insights and propose potential future research directions on the novel data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

Although recent studies have shown the popularity and advantages of React in web development, the specific challenges users face remain unknown. Thus, this study aims to analyse the React-related questions shared on Stack Overflow. The study utilizes an exploratory data analysis to investigate the most frequently discussed keywords, error classification, and user reputation-based errors, which is the novelty of this work. The results show the top eight most frequently used keywords on React-related questions, namely, code, link, vir, href, connect, azure, windows, and website. The error classification of questions from the sample shows that algorithmic error is the most frequent issue faced by all groups of users, where mid-reputation users contribute the most, accounting for 55.77%. This suggests the need for the community to provide guidance materials in solving algorithm-related problems. We expect that the results of this study will provide valuable insight into future research to support the React community during the early stages of implementation, facilitating their ability to effectively overcome challenges to adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, conference paper</p></details> |

Understanding and addressing these biases is essential for the responsible integration of LLMs into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures.

| **[CGP-Tuning: Structure-Aware Soft Prompt Tuning for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04510v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs. However, existing fine-tuning techniques often treat source code as plain text, losing the graph-based structural information inherent in code. Graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning addresses this by translating the structural information into contextual cues that the LLM can understand. However, current methods are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information, they fall short in preserving the rich semantic information (e.g., control/data flow) within code graphs. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while capturing graph-text interactions in their cross-modal alignment module. This paper presents CGP-Tuning, a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection. CGP-Tuning introduces type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with an efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational costs while incorporating graph-text interactions. It is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and three advanced open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeGemma, and Qwen2.5-Coder. Experimental results show that CGP-Tuning delivers model-agnostic improvements and maintains practical inference speed, surpassing the best graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning baseline by an average of four percentage points and outperforming non-tuned zero-shot prompting by 15 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Design Decisions of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19463v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, practitioners face significant challenges when making RAG deployment decisions. While existing research prioritizes algorithmic innovations, a systematic gap persists in understanding fundamental engineering trade-offs that determine RAG success. We present the first comprehensive study of three universal RAG deployment decisions: whether to deploy RAG, how much information to retrieve, and how to integrate retrieved knowledge effectively. Through systematic experiments across three LLMs and six datasets spanning question answering and code generation tasks, we reveal critical insights: (1) RAG deployment must be highly selective, with variable recall thresholds and failure modes affecting up to 12.6\% of samples even with perfect documents. (2) Optimal retrieval volume exhibits task-dependent behavior QA tasks show universal patterns (5-10 documents optimal) while code generation requires scenario-specific optimization. (3) Knowledge integration effectiveness depends on task and model characteristics, with code generation benefiting significantly from prompting methods while question answering shows minimal improvement. These findings demonstrate that universal RAG strategies prove inadequate. Effective RAG systems require context-aware design decisions based on task characteristics and model capabilities. Our analysis provides evidence-based guidance for practitioners and establishes foundational insights for principled RAG deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[StackTrans: From Large Language Model to Large Pushdown Automata Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15343v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transformer architecture has emerged as a landmark advancement within the broad field of artificial intelligence, effectively catalyzing the advent of large language models (LLMs). However, despite its remarkable capabilities and the substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still has some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to effectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or deterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown automata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using stacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs. Unlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans explicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This design maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention. Specifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and popping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both Chomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse tasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and other baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B parameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M outperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters, showcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under development</p></details> |

The discovery of the XZ Utils backdoor intensified these concerns because of the potential widespread impact. This study, therefore, explores the challenges of preventing and detecting malware in Linux distribution package repositories. To do so, we ask two research questions: (1) What measures have Linux distributions implemented to counter malware, and how have maintainers experienced these efforts? (2) How effective are current malware detection tools in identifying malicious Linux packages? To answer these questions, we conduct interviews with maintainers at several major Linux distributions and introduce a Linux package malware benchmark dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of six open-source malware detection scanners. Distribution maintainers, according to the interviews, have mostly focused on reproducible builds to date. Our interviews identified only a single Linux distribution, Wolfi OS, that performs active malware scanning. Using this new benchmark dataset, the evaluation found that the performance of existing open-source malware scanners is underwhelming. Most studied tools excel at producing false positives but only infrequently detect true malware. Those that avoid high false positive rates often do so at the expense of a satisfactory true positive. Our findings provide insights into Linux distribution package repositories' current practices for malware detection and demonstrate the current inadequacy of open-source tools designed to detect malicious Linux packages.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Butterfly Effects in Toolchains: A Comprehensive Analysis of Failed Parameter Filling in LLM Tool-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15296v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of the tool agent paradigm has broadened the capability boundaries of the Large Language Model (LLM), enabling it to complete more complex tasks. However, the effectiveness of this paradigm is limited due to the issue of parameter failure during its execution. To explore this phenomenon and propose corresponding suggestions, we first construct a parameter failure taxonomy in this paper. We derive five failure categories from the invocation chain of a mainstream tool agent. Then, we explore the correlation between three different input sources and failure categories by applying 15 input perturbation methods to the input. Experimental results show that parameter name hallucination failure primarily stems from inherent LLM limitations, while issues with input sources mainly cause other failure patterns. To improve the reliability and effectiveness of tool-agent interactions, we propose corresponding improvement suggestions, including standardizing tool return formats, improving error feedback mechanisms, and ensuring parameter consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Input Reduction Enhanced LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15251v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program Repair (APR). Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of failures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR. Unfortunately, LLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts. When the test inputs are extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, compromising repair performance. To address this, we propose ReduceFix, an LLM-based APR approach with a built-in component that automatically reduces test inputs while retaining their failure-inducing behavior. ReduceFix prompts an LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs without human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to guide patch generation. For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB. On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair increases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes. Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACFIX: Guiding LLMs with Mined Common RBAC Practices for Context-Aware Repair of Access Control Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06838v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical. While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined. Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check. To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them. This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Nanyang Technological University</p></details> |
| **[FaultLine: Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation Using LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15241v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the critical threat posed by software security vulnerabilities, reports are often incomplete, lacking the proof-of-vulnerability (PoV) tests needed to validate fixes and prevent regressions. These tests are crucial not only for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging problem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply nested levels of a program. We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully designed reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic program analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software project with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow of an input from an externally accessible API ("source") to the "sink" corresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an input must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along the flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a feedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or dynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming languages. To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100 known vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects. On this dataset, FaultLine is able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct 2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework. Thus, FaultLine represents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art. Our findings suggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents on PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging. We make our code and dataset publicly available in the hope that it will spur further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Clone Detection via an AlphaFold-Inspired Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15226v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection, which aims to identify functionally equivalent code fragments, plays a critical role in software maintenance and vulnerability analysis. Substantial methods have been proposed to detect code clones, but they fall short in capturing code semantics or relying on language-specific analyzers. Inspired by the remarkable success of AlphaFold in predicting three-dimensional protein structures from protein sequences, in this paper, we leverage AlphaFold for code clone detection based on the insight that protein sequences and token sequences share a common linear sequential structure. In particular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token sequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's sequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline of AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code fragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA from lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified attention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and across token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure prediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences through a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to determine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three language-diverse datasets demonstrate AlphaCC's applicability across multiple programming languages. On two semantic clone detection datasets, it consistently outperforms all baselines, showing strong semantic understanding. Moreover, AlphaCC maintains competitive efficiency, enabling practical usage in large-scale clone detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between coding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of mainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive capabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the challenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. However, existing code-generation benchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in generating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose SimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic code generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five representative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86 Advanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM Scalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a systematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18 representative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful findings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal decrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to scalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions for the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic code generation. SimdBench is fully open source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader research community.</p></details> |  |

This means that RE activities might be especially impacted by stakeholders' national culture. Software development projects increasingly have a very diverse range of stakeholders. To future-proof RE activities, we need to help RE practitioners avoid misunderstandings and conflicts that might arise from not understanding potential Cultural Influences (CIs). Moreover, an awareness of CIs supports diversity and inclusion in the IT profession. Bangladesh has a growing IT sector with some unique socio-cultural characteristics, and has been largely overlooked in this research field. In this study, we aim to investigate how the RE process is adopted in the context of Bangladeshi culture and what cultural influences impact overall RE activities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Framework Testing via Heuristic Guidance Based on Multiple Model Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15181v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning frameworks serve as the foundation for developing and deploying deep learning applications. To enhance the quality of deep learning frameworks, researchers have proposed numerous testing methods using deep learning models as test inputs. However, existing methods predominantly measure model bug detection effectiveness as heuristic indicators, presenting three critical limitations: Firstly, existing methods fail to quantitatively measure model's operator combination variety, potentially missing critical operator combinations that could trigger framework bugs. Secondly, existing methods neglect measuring model execution time, resulting in the omission of numerous models potential for detecting more framework bugs within limited testing time. Thirdly, existing methods overlook correlation between different model measurements, relying simply on single-indicator heuristic guidance without considering their trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DLMMM, the first deep learning framework testing method to include multiple model measurements into heuristic guidance and fuse these measurements to achieve their trade-off. DLMMM firstly quantitatively measures model's bug detection performance, operator combination variety, and model execution time. After that, DLMMM fuses the above measurements based on their correlation to achieve their trade-off. To further enhance testing effectiveness, DLMMM designs multi-level heuristic guidance for test input model generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Generate User Stories and Assess Their Quality?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15157v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements elicitation is still one of the most challenging activities of the requirements engineering process due to the difficulty requirements analysts face in understanding and translating complex needs into concrete requirements. In addition, specifying high-quality requirements is crucial, as it can directly impact the quality of the software to be developed. Although automated tools allow for assessing the syntactic quality of requirements, evaluating semantic metrics (e.g., language clarity, internal consistency) remains a manual and time-consuming activity. This paper explores how LLMs can help automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where requirements are defined as user stories (US). We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs to investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer interviews. We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with the quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). We also explored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the semantic quality of US. Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar to humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower diversity and creativity. Although LLM-generated US are generally comparable in quality to those created by humans, they tend to meet the acceptance quality criteria less frequently, regardless of the scale of the LLM model. Finally, LLMs can reliably assess the semantic quality of US when provided with clear evaluation criteria and have the potential to reduce human effort in large-scale assessments.</p></details> |  |

Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. STAR supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR exhibits superior effectiveness (10.5%-19.9% improvements) and efficiency (2.4-7.0 times speedup). In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figure, 8 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |

CodeT5 achieves 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines.

Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 2 listings</p></details> |

The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>Intermediate preprint (revision #1) for submission to ICGT 24 Special Issue in Logical Methods in Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[The Rise of AI Teammates in Software Engineering (SE) 3.0: How Autonomous Coding Agents Are Reshaping Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15003v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The future of software engineering--SE 3.0--is unfolding with the rise of AI teammates: autonomous, goal-driven systems collaborating with human developers. Among these, autonomous coding agents are especially transformative, now actively initiating, reviewing, and evolving code at scale. This paper introduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents operate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading agents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across 61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented empirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development. Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software engineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in benchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI governance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review timelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond synthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often outperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a trust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code submission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in three years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics). We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for the SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev enables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports building the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration.

This rise exposes users to significant new security and privacy challenges due to sociotechnical complexity, pervasive connectivity, and extensive user data collection in immersive environments. We present a systematic review of the literature published between 2013 and 2024, offering a comprehensive analysis of how the research community has addressed metaverse-related security and privacy issues over the past decade. We organize the studies by method, examined the security and privacy properties, immersive components, and evaluation strategies. Our investigation reveals a sharp increase in research activity in the last five years, a strong focus on practical and user-centered approaches, and a predominant use of benchmarking, human experimentation, and qualitative methods. Authentication and unobservability are the most frequently studied properties. However, critical gaps remain in areas such as policy compliance, accessibility, interoperability, and back-end infrastructure security. We emphasize the intertwined technical complexity and human factors of the metaverse and call for integrated, interdisciplinary approaches to securing inclusive and trustworthy immersive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted for publication at Computers & Security Journal</p></details> |

It aims to enable users to drive generative software development using only natural language requirements. However, since end-users often lack knowledge of software engineering, their requirement descriptions are frequently ambiguous, raising significant challenges to generative software development. Although existing approaches utilize structured languages like Gherkin to clarify user narratives, they still struggle to express the causal logic between preconditions and behavior actions. This paper introduces RequireCEG, a requirement elicitation and self-review agent that embeds causal-effect graphs (CEGs) in a neuro-symbolic collaboration architecture. RequireCEG first uses a feature tree to analyze user narratives hierarchically, clearly defining the scope of software components and their system behavior requirements. Next, it constructs the self-healing CEGs based on the elicited requirements, capturing the causal relationships between atomic preconditions and behavioral actions. Finally, the constructed CEGs are used to review and optimize Gherkin scenarios, ensuring consistency between the generated Gherkin requirements and the system behavior requirements elicited from user narratives. To evaluate our method, we created the RGPair benchmark dataset and conducted extensive experiments. It achieves an 87% coverage rate and raises diversity by 51.88%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Software Bug Reports: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04422v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has significantly impacted software engineering research, including bug report analysis. ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[Flexible Process Variant Binding in Information Systems with Software Product Line Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17689v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different organisations often run similar digitised business processes to achieve their business goals. However, organisations often need to slightly adapt the business processes implemented in an information system in order to adopt them. Various approaches have been proposed to manage variants in process models. While these approaches mainly deal with control flow variability, in previous work we introduced an approach to manage implementation variants of digitised business processes. In this context Software Product Line (SPL) Engineering was applied to manage a set of common core artefacts including a process model from which Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS) can be derived, which differ in the implementation of their process activities. When deriving a PAIS, implementations are selected for each process activity and then included in the PAIS at compilation time. One challenge that has not yet been solved is giving users of digitised business processes the option of selecting multiple implementations at runtime. This paper extends our previous work by not only allowing for the selection of activity implementations at compile time, but also at start time and runtime. Consequently, it becomes possible to defer the decision as to which implementation should be selected to start time and runtime. Furthermore, multiple implementations of a particular activity may be selected and executed concurrently. The presented approach also allows customising the input and output data of activities. Data from expert interviews with German municipalities suggests digitising business processes with varying implementations is a widespread challenge and our approach is a way to mitigate it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Extracting Software Requirements from App Reviews using Seq2seq Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09039v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile app reviews are a large-scale data source for software improvements. A key task in this context is effectively extracting requirements from app reviews to analyze the users' needs and support the software's evolution. Recent studies show that existing methods fail at this task since app reviews usually contain informal language, grammatical and spelling errors, and a large amount of irrelevant information that might not have direct practical value for developers. To address this, we propose a novel reformulation of requirements extraction as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task based on the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) generation approach. With this aim, we propose a Seq2seq framework, incorporating a BiLSTM encoder and an LSTM decoder, enhanced with a self-attention mechanism, GloVe embeddings, and a CRF model. We evaluated our framework on two datasets: a manually annotated set of 1,000 reviews (Dataset 1) and a crowdsourced set of 23,816 reviews (Dataset 2). The quantitative evaluation of our framework showed that it outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods with an F1 score of 0.96 on Dataset 2, and achieved comparable performance on Dataset 1 with an F1 score of 0.47.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE: A Context-Aware Approach for Mining Privacy Requirements Relevant Reviews from Mental Health Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09051v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental health (MH) apps often require sensitive user data to customize services for mental wellness needs. However, such data collection practices in some MH apps raise significant privacy concerns for users. These concerns are often mentioned in app reviews, but other feedback categories, such as reliability and usability, tend to take precedence. This poses a significant challenge in automatically identifying privacy requirements-relevant reviews (privacy reviews) that can be utilized to extract privacy requirements and address users' privacy concerns. Thus, this study introduces SAGE, a context-aware approach to automatically mining privacy reviews from MH apps using Natural Language Inference (NLI) with MH domain-specific privacy hypotheses (provides domain-specific context awareness) and a GPT model (eliminates the need for fine-tuning). The quantitative evaluation of SAGE on a dataset of 204K app reviews achieved an F1 score of 0.85 without any fine-tuning, outperforming the fine-tuned baseline classifiers BERT and T5. Furthermore, SAGE extracted 748 privacy reviews previously overlooked by keyword-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness through qualitative evaluation. These reviews can later be refined into actionable privacy requirement artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2507.09049</p></details> |
| **[CMER: A Context-Aware Approach for Mining Ethical Concern-related App Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09049v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing proliferation of mobile applications in our daily lives, the concerns surrounding ethics have surged significantly. Users communicate their feedback in app reviews, frequently emphasizing ethical concerns, such as privacy and security. Incorporating these reviews has proved to be useful for many areas of software engineering (e.g., requirement engineering, testing, etc.). However, app reviews related to ethical concerns generally use domain-specific language and are typically overshadowed by more generic categories of user feedback, such as app reliability and usability. Thus, making automated extraction a challenging and time-consuming effort. This study proposes CMER (A \underline{C}ontext-Aware Approach for \underline{M}ining \underline{E}thical Concern-related App \underline{R}eviews), a novel approach that combines Natural Language Inference (NLI) and a decoder-only (LLaMA-like) Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ethical concern-related app reviews at scale. In CMER, NLI provides domain-specific context awareness by using domain-specific hypotheses, and the Llama-like LLM eliminates the need for labeled data in the classification task. We evaluated the validity of CMER by mining privacy and security-related reviews (PSRs) from the dataset of more than 382K app reviews of mobile investment apps. First, we evaluated four NLI models and compared the results of domain-specific hypotheses with generic hypotheses. Next, we evaluated three LLMs for the classification task. Finally, we combined the best NLI and LLM models (CMER) and extracted 2,178 additional PSRs overlooked by the previous study using a keyword-based approach, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of CMER. These reviews can be further refined into actionable requirement artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.07398</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Repository-Level Code Generation with Call Chain-Aware Multi-View Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14791v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code generation aims to generate code within the context of a specified repository. Existing approaches typically employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to provide LLMs with relevant contextual information extracted from the repository. However, these approaches often struggle with effectively identifying truly relevant contexts that capture the rich semantics of the repository, and their contextual perspectives remains narrow. Moreover, most approaches fail to account for the structural relationships in the retrieved code during prompt construction, hindering the LLM's ability to accurately interpret the context. To address these issues, we propose RepoScope, which leverages call chain-aware multi-view context for repository-level code generation. RepoScope constructs a Repository Structural Semantic Graph (RSSG) and retrieves a comprehensive four-view context, integrating both structural and similarity-based contexts. We propose a novel call chain prediction method that utilizes the repository's structural semantics to improve the identification of callees in the target function. Additionally, we present a structure-preserving serialization algorithm for prompt construction, ensuring the coherence of the context for the LLM. Notably, RepoScope relies solely on static analysis, eliminating the need for additional training or multiple LLM queries, thus ensuring both efficiency and generalizability. Evaluation on widely-used repository-level code generation benchmarks (CoderEval and DevEval) demonstrates that RepoScope outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 36.35% relative improvement in pass@1 scores. Further experiments emphasize RepoScope's potential to improve code generation across different tasks and its ability to integrate effectively with existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriOpt: PPA-Aware High-Quality Verilog Generation via Multi-Role LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14776v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models(LLMs) in hardware design has primarily focused on generating functionally correct Verilog code, overlooking critical Power Performance-Area(PPA) metrics essential for industrial-grade designs. To bridge this gap, we propose VeriOpt, a novel framework that leverages role-based prompting and PPA-aware optimization to enable LLMs to produce high-quality, synthesizable Verilog. VeriOpt structures LLM interactions into specialized roles (e.g., Planner, Programmer, Reviewer, Evaluator) to emulate human design workflows, while integrating PPA constraints directly into the prompting pipeline. By combining multi-modal feedback (e.g., synthesis reports, timing diagrams) with PPA aware prompting, VeriOpt achieves PPA-efficient code generation without sacrificing functional correctness. Experimental results demonstrate up to 88% reduction in power, 76% reduction in area and 73% improvement in timing closure compared to baseline LLM-generated RTL, validated using industry standard EDA tools. At the same time achieves 86% success rate in functionality evaluation. Our work advances the state-of-the-art AI-driven hardware design by addressing the critical gap between correctness and quality, paving the way for reliable LLM adoption in production workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, Accepted for ICCAD 2025, Munich, Germany</p></details> |

While CGTs offer potential productivity enhancements, their effectiveness across diverse user groups have not been sufficiently investigated. Objectives: We hypothesize that developers' interactions with CGTs vary based on gender, influencing task outcomes and cognitive load, as prior research suggests that gender differences can affect technology use and cognitive processing. Methods: The study will employ a mixed-subjects design with 54 participants, evenly divided by gender for a counterbalanced design. Participants will complete two programming tasks (medium to hard difficulty) with only CGT assistance and then with only internet access. Task orders and conditions will be counterbalanced to mitigate order effects. Data collection will include cognitive load surveys, screen recordings, and task performance metrics such as completion time, code correctness, and CGT interaction behaviors. Statistical analyses will be conducted to identify statistically significant differences in CGT usage. Expected Contributions: Our work can uncover gender differences in CGT interaction and performance among developers. Our findings can inform future CGT designs and help address usability and potential disparities in interaction patterns across diverse user groups. Conclusion: While results are not yet available, our proposal lays the groundwork for advancing fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE) in CGT design. The outcomes are anticipated to contribute to inclusive AI practices and equitable tool development for all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>ESEM ...</summary><p>ESEM 2025 Registered Reports</p></details> |
| **[Investigating the Role of LLMs Hyperparameter Tuning and Prompt Engineering to Support Domain Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14735v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has enhanced automation in software engineering tasks, including in Model Driven Engineering (MDE). However, using general-purpose LLMs for domain modeling has its limitations. One approach is to adopt fine-tuned models, but this requires significant computational resources and can lead to issues like catastrophic forgetting. This paper explores how hyperparameter tuning and prompt engineering can improve the accuracy of the Llama 3.1 model for generating domain models from textual descriptions. We use search-based methods to tune hyperparameters for a specific medical data model, resulting in a notable quality improvement over the baseline LLM. We then test the optimized hyperparameters across ten diverse application domains. While the solutions were not universally applicable, we demonstrate that combining hyperparameter tuning with prompt engineering can enhance results across nearly all examined domain models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 51st Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA)</p></details> |

The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging. In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of fundamental competencies as well as values that define the general profile of an RSE. On this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different dimensions, looking at specific types of RSE roles, proposing recommendations for organisations, and giving examples of future specialisations. An appendix details how existing curricula fit into this framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, public repository for feedback here: https://github.com/the-teachingRSE-project/competencies</p></details> |

Despite the availability of method history generation tools such as CodeShovel and CodeTracker, existing evaluations of their effectiveness are limited by inaccuracies in the ground truth oracles used. In this study, we systematically construct two new oracles -- the corrected CodeShovel oracle and a newly developed HistoryFinder oracle -- by combining automated analysis with expert-guided manual validation. We also introduce HistoryFinder, a new method history generation tool designed to improve not only the accuracy and completeness of method change histories but also to offer competitive runtime performance. Through extensive evaluation across 400 methods from 40 open-source repositories, we show that HistoryFinder consistently outperforms CodeShovel, CodeTracker, IntelliJ, and Git-based baselines in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, HistoryFinder achieves competitive runtime performance, offering the lowest mean and median execution times among all the research-based tools. While Git-based tools exhibit the fastest runtimes, this efficiency comes at the cost of significantly lower precision and recall -- leaving HistoryFinder as the best overall choice when both accuracy and efficiency are important. To facilitate adoption, we provide a web interface, CLI, and Java library for flexible usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Detection of Tangled Code Changes for Higher-Quality Method-Level Bug Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08263v2)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tangled code changes, commits that conflate unrelated modifications such as bug fixes, refactorings, and enhancements, introduce significant noise into bug datasets and adversely affect the performance of bug prediction models. Addressing this issue at a fine-grained, method-level granularity remains underexplored. This is critical to address, as recent bug prediction models, driven by practitioner demand, are increasingly focusing on finer granularity rather than traditional class- or file-level predictions. This study investigates the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting tangled code changes by leveraging both commit messages and method-level code diffs. We formulate the problem as a binary classification task and evaluate multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, using state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash. Our results demonstrate that combining commit messages with code diffs significantly enhances model performance, with the combined few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting achieving an F1-score of 0.88. Additionally, we explore machine learning models trained on LLM-generated embeddings, where a multi-layer perceptron classifier achieves superior performance (F1-score: 0.906, MCC: 0.807). Applying our approach to 49 open-source projects improves the distributional separability of code metrics between buggy and non-buggy methods, demonstrating the promise of LLMs for method-level commit untangling and potentially contributing to improving the accuracy of future bug prediction models.</p></details> |  |

While its strictest form, Unique-Cause MC/DC, offers the highest assurance, research on its efficient test generation has been lacking. This gap is particularly significant, as an analysis of large-scale avionics systems shows that 99.7% of all conditional decisions are, in fact, Singular Boolean Expressions (SBEs) the ideal structure for applying Unique-Cause MC/DC. This paper proposes 'Robin's Rule', a deterministic algorithm that directly constructs a minimal test set of N + 1 cases to guarantee 100% Unique-Cause MC/DC for SBEs with N conditions, without generating a full truth table. To validate our approach, we constructed a benchmark by reformulating the TCAS-II specifications into SBEs and verified the results using an industry-standard, certified commercial tool. The results confirm that our method consistently achieves 100% coverage with the theoretical minimum number of tests and is more efficient than the commercial tool. This work provides a practical and provably optimal solution for verifying safety-critical systems, ensuring both rigor and efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Efficient Story Point Estimation With Comparative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14642v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Story point estimation is an essential part of agile software development. Story points are unitless, project-specific effort estimates that help developers plan their sprints. Traditionally, developers estimate story points collaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the initial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team has converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious and labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with enough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is, state-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate predictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The goal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a comparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story point prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to every backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate which item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine learning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically evaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects. The model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground truth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of a regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the proposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art regression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments - providing comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than providing ratings or categorical labels.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

However, no similar studies have been conducted for computational notebooks in the context of data science. To help bridge this research gap, we make three scientific contributions: we (1) introduce a toolset for collecting code changes in Jupyter notebooks during development time; (2) use it to collect more than 100 hours of work related to a data analysis task and a machine learning task (carried out by 20 developers with different levels of expertise), resulting in a dataset containing 2,655 cells and 9,207 cell executions; and (3) use this dataset to investigate the dynamic nature of the notebook development process and the changes that take place in the notebooks. In our analysis of the collected data, we classified the changes made to the cells between executions and found that a significant number of these changes were relatively small fixes and code iteration modifications. This suggests that notebooks are used not only as a development and exploration tool but also as a debugging tool. We report a number of other insights and propose potential future research directions on the novel data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

Traditional static analysis tools often rely on symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to customized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue to struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited analysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug patterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code auditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy behaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant detection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection prompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score. Further testing on large-scale open-source systems, including the Linux kernel, uncovered 141 previously unknown bugs, of which 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed by developers, highlighting BugScope's substantial practical impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |

The results show the top eight most frequently used keywords on React-related questions, namely, code, link, vir, href, connect, azure, windows, and website. The error classification of questions from the sample shows that algorithmic error is the most frequent issue faced by all groups of users, where mid-reputation users contribute the most, accounting for 55.77%. This suggests the need for the community to provide guidance materials in solving algorithm-related problems.

| **[Applying the Chinese Wall Reverse Engineering Technique to Large Language Model Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15599v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code (Code LLM) are increasingly utilized in programming environments. Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of LLMs' Preferences for Libraries and Programming Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17181v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, influencing users' choices of libraries and programming languages in critical real-world projects. However, little is known about their systematic biases or preferences toward certain libraries and programming languages, which can significantly impact software development practices. To fill this gap, we perform the first empirical study of LLMs' preferences for libraries and programming languages when generating code, covering eight diverse LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to overuse widely adopted libraries such as NumPy; in up to 48% of cases, this usage is unnecessary and deviates from the ground-truth solutions. LLMs also exhibit a significant preference toward Python as their default language. For high-performance project initialisation tasks where Python is not the optimal language, it remains the dominant choice in 58% of cases, and Rust is not used a single time. These results indicate that LLMs may prioritise familiarity and popularity over suitability and task-specific optimality. This will introduce security vulnerabilities and technical debt, and limit exposure to newly developed, better-suited tools and languages. Understanding and addressing these biases is essential for the responsible integration of LLMs into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 2 figures.

| **[CGP-Tuning: Structure-Aware Soft Prompt Tuning for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04510v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs. However, existing fine-tuning techniques often treat source code as plain text, losing the graph-based structural information inherent in code. Graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning addresses this by translating the structural information into contextual cues that the LLM can understand. However, current methods are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information, they fall short in preserving the rich semantic information (e.g., control/data flow) within code graphs. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while capturing graph-text interactions in their cross-modal alignment module. This paper presents CGP-Tuning, a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection. CGP-Tuning introduces type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with an efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational costs while incorporating graph-text interactions. It is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and three advanced open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeGemma, and Qwen2.5-Coder. Experimental results show that CGP-Tuning delivers model-agnostic improvements and maintains practical inference speed, surpassing the best graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning baseline by an average of four percentage points and outperforming non-tuned zero-shot prompting by 15 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Design Decisions of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19463v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, practitioners face significant challenges when making RAG deployment decisions. While existing research prioritizes algorithmic innovations, a systematic gap persists in understanding fundamental engineering trade-offs that determine RAG success. We present the first comprehensive study of three universal RAG deployment decisions: whether to deploy RAG, how much information to retrieve, and how to integrate retrieved knowledge effectively. Through systematic experiments across three LLMs and six datasets spanning question answering and code generation tasks, we reveal critical insights: (1) RAG deployment must be highly selective, with variable recall thresholds and failure modes affecting up to 12.6\% of samples even with perfect documents. (2) Optimal retrieval volume exhibits task-dependent behavior QA tasks show universal patterns (5-10 documents optimal) while code generation requires scenario-specific optimization. (3) Knowledge integration effectiveness depends on task and model characteristics, with code generation benefiting significantly from prompting methods while question answering shows minimal improvement. These findings demonstrate that universal RAG strategies prove inadequate. Effective RAG systems require context-aware design decisions based on task characteristics and model capabilities. Our analysis provides evidence-based guidance for practitioners and establishes foundational insights for principled RAG deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Butterfly Effects in Toolchains: A Comprehensive Analysis of Failed Parameter Filling in LLM Tool-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15296v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of the tool agent paradigm has broadened the capability boundaries of the Large Language Model (LLM), enabling it to complete more complex tasks. However, the effectiveness of this paradigm is limited due to the issue of parameter failure during its execution. To explore this phenomenon and propose corresponding suggestions, we first construct a parameter failure taxonomy in this paper. We derive five failure categories from the invocation chain of a mainstream tool agent. Then, we explore the correlation between three different input sources and failure categories by applying 15 input perturbation methods to the input. Experimental results show that parameter name hallucination failure primarily stems from inherent LLM limitations, while issues with input sources mainly cause other failure patterns. To improve the reliability and effectiveness of tool-agent interactions, we propose corresponding improvement suggestions, including standardizing tool return formats, improving error feedback mechanisms, and ensuring parameter consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACFIX: Guiding LLMs with Mined Common RBAC Practices for Context-Aware Repair of Access Control Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06838v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical. While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined. Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check. To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them. This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Nanyang Technological University</p></details> |
| **[FaultLine: Automated Proof-of-Vulnerability Generation Using LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15241v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the critical threat posed by software security vulnerabilities, reports are often incomplete, lacking the proof-of-vulnerability (PoV) tests needed to validate fixes and prevent regressions. These tests are crucial not only for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging problem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply nested levels of a program. We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully designed reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic program analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software project with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow of an input from an externally accessible API ("source") to the "sink" corresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an input must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along the flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a feedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or dynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming languages. To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100 known vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects. On this dataset, FaultLine is able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct 2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework. Thus, FaultLine represents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art. Our findings suggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents on PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging. We make our code and dataset publicly available in the hope that it will spur further research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Clone Detection via an AlphaFold-Inspired Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15226v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection, which aims to identify functionally equivalent code fragments, plays a critical role in software maintenance and vulnerability analysis. Substantial methods have been proposed to detect code clones, but they fall short in capturing code semantics or relying on language-specific analyzers. Inspired by the remarkable success of AlphaFold in predicting three-dimensional protein structures from protein sequences, in this paper, we leverage AlphaFold for code clone detection based on the insight that protein sequences and token sequences share a common linear sequential structure. In particular, we propose AlphaCC, which represents code fragments as token sequences to ensure multi-language applicability and adapts AlphaFold's sequence-to-structure modeling capability to infer code semantics. The pipeline of AlphaCC goes through three steps. First, AlphaCC transforms each input code fragment into a token sequence and, motivated by AlphaFold's use of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to enhance contextual understanding, constructs an MSA from lexically similar token sequences. Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified attention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and across token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure prediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences through a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to determine code clone pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on three language-diverse datasets demonstrate AlphaCC's applicability across multiple programming languages. On two semantic clone detection datasets, it consistently outperforms all baselines, showing strong semantic understanding. Moreover, AlphaCC maintains competitive efficiency, enabling practical usage in large-scale clone detection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimdBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for SIMD-Intrinsic Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15224v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions and their compiler intrinsics are widely supported by modern processors to accelerate performance-critical tasks. SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between coding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of mainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive capabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the challenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. However, existing code-generation benchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in generating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose SimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic code generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five representative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86 Advanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM Scalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a systematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18 representative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful findings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal decrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to scalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions for the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic code generation. SimdBench is fully open source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. STAR supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR exhibits superior effectiveness (10.5%-19.9% improvements) and efficiency (2.4-7.0 times speedup). In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figure, 8 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |

Existing tools detect such smells but rarely suggest how to fix them. This paper explores the use of pre-trained transformer models--CodeBERT and CodeT5--for recommending suitable refactorings based on detected smells. We frame the task as a three-class classification problem and fine-tune both models on over 2 million refactoring instances mined from 11,149 open-source Java projects. CodeT5 achieves 96.9% accuracy and 95.2% F1, outperforming CodeBERT and traditional baselines. Our results show that transformer-based models can effectively bridge the gap between smell detection and actionable repair, laying the foundation for future refactoring recommendation systems. We release all code, models, and data under an open license to support reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)</p></details> |

This versatile toolbox is designed to empower developers and machine learning practitioners with robust tools for verifying and ensuring the trustworthiness of their DNN models.</p></details> |  |

Automotive software development is considered to be a significant area for GenAI adoption, taking into account lengthy and expensive procedures, resulting from the amount of requirements and strict standardization. In this paper, we explore the adoption of GenAI for various steps of automotive software development, mainly focusing on requirements handling, compliance aspects and code generation. Three GenAI-related technologies are covered within the state-of-art: Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Vision Language Models (VLMs), as well as overview of adopted prompting techniques in case of code generation. Additionally, we also derive a generalized GenAI-aided automotive software development workflow based on our findings from this literature review.

Among these, autonomous coding agents are especially transformative, now actively initiating, reviewing, and evolving code at scale. This paper introduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents operate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading agents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across 61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented empirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development. Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software engineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in benchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI governance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review timelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond synthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often outperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a trust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code submission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in three years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics). We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for the SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev enables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports building the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/SAILResearch/AI_Teammates_in_SE3. > AI Agent, Agentic AI, Coding Agent, Agentic Coding, Software Engineering Agent</p></details> |  |

However, no similar studies have been conducted for computational notebooks in the context of data science. To help bridge this research gap, we make three scientific contributions: we (1) introduce a toolset for collecting code changes in Jupyter notebooks during development time; (2) use it to collect more than 100 hours of work related to a data analysis task and a machine learning task (carried out by 20 developers with different levels of expertise), resulting in a dataset containing 2,655 cells and 9,207 cell executions; and (3) use this dataset to investigate the dynamic nature of the notebook development process and the changes that take place in the notebooks. In our analysis of the collected data, we classified the changes made to the cells between executions and found that a significant number of these changes were relatively small fixes and code iteration modifications. This suggests that notebooks are used not only as a development and exploration tool but also as a debugging tool. We report a number of other insights and propose potential future research directions on the novel data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[BugScope: Learn to Find Bugs Like Human](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15671v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting software bugs remains a fundamental challenge due to the extensive diversity of real-world defects. Traditional static analysis tools often rely on symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to customized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue to struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited analysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug patterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code auditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy behaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant detection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection prompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score. Further testing on large-scale open-source systems, including the Linux kernel, uncovered 141 previously unknown bugs, of which 78 have been fixed and 7 confirmed by developers, highlighting BugScope's substantial practical impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figure, 6 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |

The article aims to make a reasoned choice of the approach to modelling the battery discharge of a CubeSat satellite. Modelling the battery discharge of a satellite will enable the prediction of the consequences of disconnecting the autonomous power system and ensure the fault tolerance of equipment in orbit. Therefore, the selected study is relevant and promising. This study focuses on the analysis of CubeSat satellite data, based explicitly on orbital data samples of the power system, which include data available at the time of the article publication. The dataset contains data on the voltage, current, and temperature of the battery and solar panels attached to the five sides of the satellite. In this context, two approaches are considered: analytical modelling based on physical laws and machine learning, which uses empirical data to create a predictive model. Results: A comparative analysis of the modeling results reveals that the equivalent circuit approach has the advantage of transparency, as it identifies possible parameters that facilitate understanding of the relationships. However, the model is less flexible to environmental changes or non-standard satellite behavior. The machine learning model demonstrated more accurate results, as it can account for complex dependencies and adapt to actual conditions, even when they deviate from theoretical assumptions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability. Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models. Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model. Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts. Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.</p></details> |  |

| **[Applying the Chinese Wall Reverse Engineering Technique to Large Language Model Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15599v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code (Code LLM) are increasingly utilized in programming environments. Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.</p></details> |  |
