| **[Efficient Exploration of Chemical Kinetics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21368v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability. This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral dissertation, 121 pages, ISBN: 978-9935-9826-5-0.

| **[From Signal to Turn: Interactional Friction in Modular Speech-to-Speech Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11724v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While voice-based AI systems have achieved remarkable generative capabilities, their interactions often feel conversationally broken. This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Confucius Code Agent: An Open-sourced AI Software Engineer at Industrial Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10398v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Meta ...</summary><p>Meta requires more thorough internal review process to ensure paper quality and experiments as well as compliance with the internal research publishing process</p></details> |
| **[Vital: Vulnerability-Oriented Symbolic Execution via Type-Unsafe Pointer-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08772v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to find memory safety bugs efficiently when navigating a symbolic execution tree that suffers from path explosion? Existing solutions either adopt path search heuristics to maximize coverage rate or chopped symbolic execution to skip uninteresting code (i.e., manually labeled as vulnerability-unrelated) during path exploration. However, most existing search heuristics are not vulnerability-oriented, and manual labeling of irrelevant code-to-be-skipped relies heavily on prior expert knowledge, making it hard to detect vulnerabilities effectively in practice. This paper proposes Vital, a new vulnerability-oriented path exploration for symbolic execution with two innovations. First, a new indicator (i.e., type-unsafe pointers) is suggested to approximate vulnerable paths. A pointer that is type-unsafe cannot be statically proven to be safely dereferenced without memory corruption. Our key hypothesis is that a path with more type-unsafe pointers is more likely to be vulnerable. Second, a new type-unsafe pointer-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm is implemented to guide the path exploration towards the areas that contain more unsafe pointers, aiming to increase the likelihood of detecting vulnerabilities. We built Vital on top of KLEE and compared it with existing path searching strategies and chopped symbolic execution. In the former, the results demonstrate that Vital could cover up to 90.03% more unsafe pointers and detect up to 57.14% more unique memory errors. In the latter, the results show that Vital could achieve a speedup of up to 30x execution time and a reduction of up to 20x memory consumption to detect known vulnerabilities without prior expert knowledge automatically. In practice, Vital also detected one previously unknown vulnerability (a new CVE ID is assigned), which has been fixed by developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Just ...</summary><p>Just Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM)</p></details> |

While recent studies have begun to characterise production microservice deployments, they are often limited in breadth, do not compare findings across deployments, and lack consideration of the implications of findings for commonly held assumptions. We analyse a distributed tracing dataset from Alibaba's production microservice deployment to examine its scale, heterogeneity, and dynamicity. By comparing our findings to prior measurements of Meta's MSA we illustrate both convergent and divergent properties, clarifying which patterns may generalise. Our study reveals extreme architectural scale, long-tail distributions of workloads and dependencies, highly diverse functionality, substantial call graph variability, and pronounced time-varying behaviour which diverge from assumptions underlying research models and testbeds. We summarise how these observations challenge common assumptions in research on fault management, scaling, and testbed design, and outline recommendations for more realistic future approaches and evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables, revised version for conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Causal symmetrization as an empirical signature of operational autonomy in complex systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09352v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theoretical biology has long proposed that autonomous systems sustain their identity through reciprocal constraints between structure and activity, a dynamical regime underlying concepts such as closure to efficient causation and autopoiesis. Despite their influence, these principles have resisted direct empirical assessment outside biological systems. Here, we empirically assess this framework in artificial sociotechnical systems by identifying a statistical signature consistent with operational autonomy. Analyzing 50 large-scale collaborative software ecosystems spanning 11,042 system-months, we develop an order parameter ($Γ$) quantifying structural persistence under component turnover and use Granger causality to characterize directional coupling between organizational architecture and collective activity. $Γ$ exhibits a bimodal distribution (Hartigan's dip test $p = 0.0126$; $Δ$BIC = 2000), revealing a sharp phase transition between an exploratory regime of high variance and a mature regime characterized by a 1.77-fold variance collapse. At maturity, causal symmetrization emerges, with the structure--activity coupling ratio shifting from 0.71 (activity-driven) to 0.94 (bidirectional). A composite viability index combining activity and structural persistence outperforms activity-based prediction alone (AUC = 0.88 vs. 0.81), identifying ``structural zombie'' systems in which sustained activity masks architectural decay. Together, these results show that causal symmetrization functions as a necessary statistical signature consistent with theoretical notions of operational closure, without implying biological life or mechanistic closure. They demonstrate that core principles of autonomy can be empirically probed in artificial collaborative systems, supporting substrate-independent dynamical signatures of self-organizing autonomy across complex adaptive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Study of Library Usage in Agent-Authored Pull Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11589v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding agents are becoming increasingly capable of completing end-to-end software engineering workflows that previously required a human developer, including raising pull requests (PRs) to propose their changes. However, we still know little about how these agents use libraries when generating code, a core part of real-world software development. To fill this gap, we study 26,760 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset to examine three questions: how often do agents import libraries, how often do they introduce new dependencies (and with what versioning), and which specific libraries do they choose? We find that agents often import libraries (29.5% of PRs) but rarely add new dependencies (1.3% of PRs); and when they do, they follow strong versioning practices (75.0% specify a version), an improvement on direct LLM usage where versions are rarely mentioned. Generally, agents draw from a surprisingly diverse set of external libraries, contrasting with the limited "library preferences" seen in prior non-agentic LLM studies. Our results offer an early empirical view into how AI coding agents interact with today's software ecosystems.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 tables |

To address the limitations of existing SFC simulation tools, this paper introduces Mini-SFC, a modular simulation framework that supports both numerical and container-based virtual simulations, while also supporting online dynamic topology adjustments. As an open-source platform emphasizing user-friendliness, Mini-SFC facilitates rapid algorithm verification and realistic service deployment validation. By simplifying module design and providing standardized solver interfaces, Mini-SFC significantly shortens the learning curve for researchers and enhances the flexibility and scalability required for advanced SFC management and optimization. For readers interested in exploring or utilizing Mini-SFC, more information is available on the official project page.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing 50 large-scale collaborative software ecosystems spanning 11,042 system-months, we develop an order parameter ($Γ$) quantifying structural persistence under component turnover and use Granger causality to characterize directional coupling between organizational architecture and collective activity. $Γ$ exhibits a bimodal distribution (Hartigan's dip test $p = 0.0126$; $Δ$BIC = 2000), revealing a sharp phase transition between an exploratory regime of high variance and a mature regime characterized by a 1.77-fold variance collapse.

A composite viability index combining activity and structural persistence outperforms activity-based prediction alone (AUC = 0.88 vs. 0.81), identifying ``structural zombie'' systems in which sustained activity masks architectural decay. Together, these results show that causal symmetrization functions as a necessary statistical signature consistent with theoretical notions of operational closure, without implying biological life or mechanistic closure.

Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches.

We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale.

Existing solutions either adopt path search heuristics to maximize coverage rate or chopped symbolic execution to skip uninteresting code (i.e., manually labeled as vulnerability-unrelated) during path exploration. However, most existing search heuristics are not vulnerability-oriented, and manual labeling of irrelevant code-to-be-skipped relies heavily on prior expert knowledge, making it hard to detect vulnerabilities effectively in practice. This paper proposes Vital, a new vulnerability-oriented path exploration for symbolic execution with two innovations. First, a new indicator (i.e., type-unsafe pointers) is suggested to approximate vulnerable paths. A pointer that is type-unsafe cannot be statically proven to be safely dereferenced without memory corruption. Our key hypothesis is that a path with more type-unsafe pointers is more likely to be vulnerable. Second, a new type-unsafe pointer-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm is implemented to guide the path exploration towards the areas that contain more unsafe pointers, aiming to increase the likelihood of detecting vulnerabilities. We built Vital on top of KLEE and compared it with existing path searching strategies and chopped symbolic execution. In the former, the results demonstrate that Vital could cover up to 90.03% more unsafe pointers and detect up to 57.14% more unique memory errors. In the latter, the results show that Vital could achieve a speedup of up to 30x execution time and a reduction of up to 20x memory consumption to detect known vulnerabilities without prior expert knowledge automatically. In practice, Vital also detected one previously unknown vulnerability (a new CVE ID is assigned), which has been fixed by developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Just ...</summary><p>Just Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM)</p></details> |

We analyse a distributed tracing dataset from Alibaba's production microservice deployment to examine its scale, heterogeneity, and dynamicity. By comparing our findings to prior measurements of Meta's MSA we illustrate both convergent and divergent properties, clarifying which patterns may generalise. Our study reveals extreme architectural scale, long-tail distributions of workloads and dependencies, highly diverse functionality, substantial call graph variability, and pronounced time-varying behaviour which diverge from assumptions underlying research models and testbeds.

Existing solutions either adopt path search heuristics to maximize coverage rate or chopped symbolic execution to skip uninteresting code (i.e., manually labeled as vulnerability-unrelated) during path exploration. However, most existing search heuristics are not vulnerability-oriented, and manual labeling of irrelevant code-to-be-skipped relies heavily on prior expert knowledge, making it hard to detect vulnerabilities effectively in practice. This paper proposes Vital, a new vulnerability-oriented path exploration for symbolic execution with two innovations. First, a new indicator (i.e., type-unsafe pointers) is suggested to approximate vulnerable paths. A pointer that is type-unsafe cannot be statically proven to be safely dereferenced without memory corruption. Our key hypothesis is that a path with more type-unsafe pointers is more likely to be vulnerable. Second, a new type-unsafe pointer-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm is implemented to guide the path exploration towards the areas that contain more unsafe pointers, aiming to increase the likelihood of detecting vulnerabilities. We built Vital on top of KLEE and compared it with existing path searching strategies and chopped symbolic execution. In the former, the results demonstrate that Vital could cover up to 90.03% more unsafe pointers and detect up to 57.14% more unique memory errors. In the latter, the results show that Vital could achieve a speedup of up to 30x execution time and a reduction of up to 20x memory consumption to detect known vulnerabilities without prior expert knowledge automatically. In practice, Vital also detected one previously unknown vulnerability (a new CVE ID is assigned), which has been fixed by developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Just ...</summary><p>Just Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM)</p></details> |

Analyzing 50 large-scale collaborative software ecosystems spanning 11,042 system-months, we develop an order parameter ($Γ$) quantifying structural persistence under component turnover and use Granger causality to characterize directional coupling between organizational architecture and collective activity. $Γ$ exhibits a bimodal distribution (Hartigan's dip test $p = 0.0126$; $Δ$BIC = 2000), revealing a sharp phase transition between an exploratory regime of high variance and a mature regime characterized by a 1.77-fold variance collapse.

Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability. This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral dissertation, 121 pages, ISBN: 978-9935-9826-5-0.

This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Meta ...</summary><p>Meta requires more thorough internal review process to ensure paper quality and experiments as well as compliance with the internal research publishing process</p></details> |

Existing solutions either adopt path search heuristics to maximize coverage rate or chopped symbolic execution to skip uninteresting code (i.e., manually labeled as vulnerability-unrelated) during path exploration. However, most existing search heuristics are not vulnerability-oriented, and manual labeling of irrelevant code-to-be-skipped relies heavily on prior expert knowledge, making it hard to detect vulnerabilities effectively in practice. This paper proposes Vital, a new vulnerability-oriented path exploration for symbolic execution with two innovations. First, a new indicator (i.e., type-unsafe pointers) is suggested to approximate vulnerable paths. A pointer that is type-unsafe cannot be statically proven to be safely dereferenced without memory corruption. Our key hypothesis is that a path with more type-unsafe pointers is more likely to be vulnerable. Second, a new type-unsafe pointer-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm is implemented to guide the path exploration towards the areas that contain more unsafe pointers, aiming to increase the likelihood of detecting vulnerabilities. We built Vital on top of KLEE and compared it with existing path searching strategies and chopped symbolic execution. In the former, the results demonstrate that Vital could cover up to 90.03% more unsafe pointers and detect up to 57.14% more unique memory errors. In the latter, the results show that Vital could achieve a speedup of up to 30x execution time and a reduction of up to 20x memory consumption to detect known vulnerabilities without prior expert knowledge automatically.

Analyzing 50 large-scale collaborative software ecosystems spanning 11,042 system-months, we develop an order parameter ($Γ$) quantifying structural persistence under component turnover and use Granger causality to characterize directional coupling between organizational architecture and collective activity. $Γ$ exhibits a bimodal distribution (Hartigan's dip test $p = 0.0126$; $Δ$BIC = 2000), revealing a sharp phase transition between an exploratory regime of high variance and a mature regime characterized by a 1.77-fold variance collapse.

A composite viability index combining activity and structural persistence outperforms activity-based prediction alone (AUC = 0.88 vs. 0.81), identifying ``structural zombie'' systems in which sustained activity masks architectural decay. Together, these results show that causal symmetrization functions as a necessary statistical signature consistent with theoretical notions of operational closure, without implying biological life or mechanistic closure.

However, we still know little about how these agents use libraries when generating code, a core part of real-world software development. To fill this gap, we study 26,760 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset to examine three questions: how often do agents import libraries, how often do they introduce new dependencies (and with what versioning), and which specific libraries do they choose? We find that agents often import libraries (29.5% of PRs) but rarely add new dependencies (1.3% of PRs); and when they do, they follow strong versioning practices (75.0% specify a version), an improvement on direct LLM usage where versions are rarely mentioned. Generally, agents draw from a surprisingly diverse set of external libraries, contrasting with the limited "library preferences" seen in prior non-agentic LLM studies. Our results offer an early empirical view into how AI coding agents interact with today's software ecosystems.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 tables |

Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability. This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling.

Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability. This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral dissertation, 121 pages, ISBN: 978-9935-9826-5-0.

This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Meta ...</summary><p>Meta requires more thorough internal review process to ensure paper quality and experiments as well as compliance with the internal research publishing process</p></details> |

Existing solutions either adopt path search heuristics to maximize coverage rate or chopped symbolic execution to skip uninteresting code (i.e., manually labeled as vulnerability-unrelated) during path exploration. However, most existing search heuristics are not vulnerability-oriented, and manual labeling of irrelevant code-to-be-skipped relies heavily on prior expert knowledge, making it hard to detect vulnerabilities effectively in practice. This paper proposes Vital, a new vulnerability-oriented path exploration for symbolic execution with two innovations. First, a new indicator (i.e., type-unsafe pointers) is suggested to approximate vulnerable paths. A pointer that is type-unsafe cannot be statically proven to be safely dereferenced without memory corruption. Our key hypothesis is that a path with more type-unsafe pointers is more likely to be vulnerable. Second, a new type-unsafe pointer-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm is implemented to guide the path exploration towards the areas that contain more unsafe pointers, aiming to increase the likelihood of detecting vulnerabilities. We built Vital on top of KLEE and compared it with existing path searching strategies and chopped symbolic execution. In the former, the results demonstrate that Vital could cover up to 90.03% more unsafe pointers and detect up to 57.14% more unique memory errors. In the latter, the results show that Vital could achieve a speedup of up to 30x execution time and a reduction of up to 20x memory consumption to detect known vulnerabilities without prior expert knowledge automatically. In practice, Vital also detected one previously unknown vulnerability (a new CVE ID is assigned), which has been fixed by developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Just ...</summary><p>Just Accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (ACM TOSEM)</p></details> |

While recent studies have begun to characterise production microservice deployments, they are often limited in breadth, do not compare findings across deployments, and lack consideration of the implications of findings for commonly held assumptions. We analyse a distributed tracing dataset from Alibaba's production microservice deployment to examine its scale, heterogeneity, and dynamicity. By comparing our findings to prior measurements of Meta's MSA we illustrate both convergent and divergent properties, clarifying which patterns may generalise. Our study reveals extreme architectural scale, long-tail distributions of workloads and dependencies, highly diverse functionality, substantial call graph variability, and pronounced time-varying behaviour which diverge from assumptions underlying research models and testbeds. We summarise how these observations challenge common assumptions in research on fault management, scaling, and testbed design, and outline recommendations for more realistic future approaches and evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables, revised version for conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Causal symmetrization as an empirical signature of operational autonomy in complex systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09352v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theoretical biology has long proposed that autonomous systems sustain their identity through reciprocal constraints between structure and activity, a dynamical regime underlying concepts such as closure to efficient causation and autopoiesis. Despite their influence, these principles have resisted direct empirical assessment outside biological systems. Here, we empirically assess this framework in artificial sociotechnical systems by identifying a statistical signature consistent with operational autonomy. Analyzing 50 large-scale collaborative software ecosystems spanning 11,042 system-months, we develop an order parameter ($Γ$) quantifying structural persistence under component turnover and use Granger causality to characterize directional coupling between organizational architecture and collective activity. $Γ$ exhibits a bimodal distribution (Hartigan's dip test $p = 0.0126$; $Δ$BIC = 2000), revealing a sharp phase transition between an exploratory regime of high variance and a mature regime characterized by a 1.77-fold variance collapse. At maturity, causal symmetrization emerges, with the structure--activity coupling ratio shifting from 0.71 (activity-driven) to 0.94 (bidirectional). A composite viability index combining activity and structural persistence outperforms activity-based prediction alone (AUC = 0.88 vs. 0.81), identifying ``structural zombie'' systems in which sustained activity masks architectural decay. Together, these results show that causal symmetrization functions as a necessary statistical signature consistent with theoretical notions of operational closure, without implying biological life or mechanistic closure. They demonstrate that core principles of autonomy can be empirically probed in artificial collaborative systems, supporting substrate-independent dynamical signatures of self-organizing autonomy across complex adaptive systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
