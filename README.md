| **[SciReplicate-Bench: Benchmarking LLMs in Agent-driven Algorithmic Reproduction from Research Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00255v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) in generating code from algorithm descriptions in recent NLP papers. The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We make available our benchmark and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench and project homepage at https://xyzcs.github.io/scireplicate.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).</p></details> | <details><summary>*Firs...</summary><p>*First three authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01215v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |

EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93% functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing .NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96% semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90% compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under measurable control.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 tables, 1 algorithm.

| **[STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench: Evaluating Complex Multi-Function Comprehension and Fine-Grained Execution Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05193v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code intelligence, yet systematically evaluating their code understanding and reasoning abilities remains challenging. Mainstream benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores, limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g., chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including 14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis, symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-assisted JSON Schema Creation and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05192v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models at the core of system and data engineering processes. In the context of research data, these models are typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data integration for non-experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Tools and Demonstrations Track of ACM/IEEE MODELS'25</p></details> |

| **[Automated File-Level Logging Generation for Machine Learning Applications using LLMs: A Case Study using GPT-4o Mini](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04820v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

As these models become integral to development workflows, a systematic comparison of their performance is essential for optimizing their use in real world applications. This study benchmarks these four prominent LLMs on one hundred and fifty LeetCode problems across easy, medium, and hard difficulties, generating solutions in Java and Python. We evaluate each model based on execution time, memory usage, and algorithmic complexity, revealing significant performance differences. ChatGPT demonstrates consistent efficiency in execution time and memory usage, while Copilot and DeepSeek show variability as task complexity increases. Gemini, although effective on simpler tasks, requires more attempts as problem difficulty rises. Our findings provide actionable insights into each model's strengths and limitations, offering guidance for developers selecting LLMs for specific coding tasks and providing insights on the performance and complexity of GPT-like generated solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 13 figures, 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE)</p></details> |

This framework includes a design recipe for regular expressions and a customized error messaging system. The error messaging system produces recipe-based errors that include the step of the design recipe not successfully completed. Furthermore, the error messages follow the established practices of being concise, succinct, jargon-free, and nonprescriptive. In addition, a shorthand syntax developed for writing unit tests is described. The in-class use of the design recipe is illustrated, two debugging sessions using the described system are discussed, and the implementation of the error messaging system is briefly sketched.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |
| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.

| **[Testing the Untestable? An Empirical Study on the Testing Process of LLM-Powered Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00198v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Software systems powered by large language models are becoming a routine part of everyday technologies, supporting applications across a wide range of domains. In software engineering, many studies have focused on how LLMs support tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation. However, there has been limited focus on how full systems that integrate LLMs are tested during development. Aims: This study explores how LLM-powered systems are tested in the context of real-world application development. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 99 individual reports written by students who built and deployed LLM-powered applications as part of a university course. Each report was independently analyzed using thematic analysis, supported by a structured coding process. Results: Testing strategies combined manual and automated methods to evaluate both system logic and model behavior. Common practices included exploratory testing, unit testing, and prompt iteration. Reported challenges included integration failures, unpredictable outputs, prompt sensitivity, hallucinations, and uncertainty about correctness. Conclusions: Testing LLM-powered systems required adaptations to traditional verification methods, blending source-level reasoning with behavior-aware evaluations. These findings provide evidence on the practical context of testing generative components in software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Screencast-Based Analysis of User-Perceived GUI Responsiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01337v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUI responsiveness is critical for a positive user experience in mobile applications. Even brief delays in visual feedback can frustrate users and lead to negative reviews. However, detecting and quantifying such user-perceived delays remains challenging, especially in industrial testing pipelines that evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions. Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful, may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively. In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts -- video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead.

| **[A Survey on Code Generation with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00083v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Machine Learning Pipeline for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00045v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of software development practices has introduced challenges in ensuring quality and efficiency across the software engineering (SE) lifecycle. As SE systems grow in complexity, traditional approaches often fail to scale, resulting in longer debugging times, inefficient defect detection, and resource-heavy development cycles. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a key solution, enabling automation in tasks such as defect prediction, code review, and release quality estimation. However, the effectiveness of ML in SE depends on the robustness of its pipeline, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, validation, and evaluation. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines state-of-the-art ML pipelines designed for SE, consolidating best practices, challenges, and gaps. Our findings show that robust preprocessing, such as SMOTE for data balancing and SZZ-based algorithms for feature selection, improves model reliability. Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting dominate performance across tasks, while simpler models such as Naive Bayes remain valuable for efficiency and interpretability. Evaluation metrics including AUC, F1-score, and precision are most common, with new metrics like Best Arithmetic Mean (BAM) emerging in niche applications. Validation techniques such as bootstrapping are widely used to ensure model stability and generalizability. This SLR highlights the importance of well-designed ML pipelines for addressing SE challenges and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize software quality and efficiency. By identifying gaps and trends, this study sets a foundation for advancing ML adoption and fostering innovation in increasingly complex development environments.</p></details> |  |

However, ABPs may raise specific concerns including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs, characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM research challenges towards XABPs.</p></details> |  |

The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15 participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by 50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use commercial code LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under review</p></details> |

Debugging remains unsolved despite these advances. While Claude Opus 4 and GPT-4.1 achieve >70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they perform <15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model built specifically for debugging. Chronos combines Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to navigate codebases up to 10 million lines using multi-hop traversal (92% precision, 85% recall), Persistent Debug Memory trained on 15M+ sessions, and a 7-layer architecture for iterative fix-test-refine loops. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy, compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude and GPT-4.1 respectively. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iteration count by 65%. It resolves complex multi-file bugs involving cross-repository context and temporal reasoning. Key limitations include 23.4% success on hardware-dependent issues and 41.2% on dynamic language errors. Theoretical analysis shows O(k log d) retrieval complexity with convergence guarantees. In a human evaluation (N=50), 89% of participants preferred Chronos over baseline models. Chronos will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 21 figures, 37 tables, 2 algorithms.

However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction. complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of automated debugging of HLS code.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at ICCAD 2025 (International Conference on Computer-Aided Design)</p></details> |

Traditional debugging techniques from classical software engineering cannot directly resolve this issue due to the inherently stochastic nature of quantum computation mixed with noises from NISQ computers. To address this gap, we propose a statistical approach leveraging probabilistic metrics to differentiate between quantum software bugs and hardware noise. We evaluate our methodology empirically using well-known quantum algorithms, including Grover's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Simon's algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach, providing quantum software developers with a reliable analytical tool to identify and classify unexpected behavior in quantum programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 30 figures, accepted by the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE), IEEE Quantum Week, 2025</p></details> |
| **[BOOP: Write Right Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22085v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers frequently adopt a syntax-specific and test-case-driven approach, writing code first and adjusting until programs compile and test cases pass, rather than developing correct solutions through systematic reasoning. AI coding tools exacerbate this challenge by providing syntactically correct but conceptually flawed solutions. In this paper, we introduce BOOP (Blueprint, Operations, OCaml, Proof), a structured framework requiring four mandatory phases: formal specification, language-agnostic algorithm development, implementation, and correctness proof. This shifts focus from ``making code work'' to understanding why code is correct. BOOP was implemented at our institution using a VS Code extension and preprocessor that enforces constraints and identifies counterproductive patterns. Initial evaluation shows improved algorithmic reasoning and reduced trial-and-error debugging. Students reported better edge case understanding and problem decomposition, though some initially found the format verbose. Instructors observed stronger foundational skills compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentMesh: A Cooperative Multi-Agent Generative AI Framework for Software Development Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19902v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents - a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication, and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations - such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLICEMATE: Accurate and Scalable Static Program Slicing via LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18957v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static program slicing, which extracts the executable portions of a program that affect the values at a specific location, supports many software analysis tasks such as debugging and security auditing. However, traditional slicing tools rely on computationally expensive reachability analysis over dependency graphs, which struggle to scale to large programs and often fail to handle code with incomplete syntax. Recently emerged learning-based methods, while more robust to such cases, still fall short of achieving comparable performance to traditional methods on well-formed code. In this work, we propose SliceMate, a novel static program slicing solution powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It bypasses the need for explicit dependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy. Concretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis agent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope across functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a verification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the candidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a refinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with the verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module that ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual intervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality benchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python programs, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly larger than those in existing slicing benchmarks. Experimental results show that SliceMate greatly outperforms both traditional and learning-based slicing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoCoder: Automated Function Synthesis using LLM-Supported Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18812v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts. To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs) in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding the Challenges of Bug Localization in Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01021v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bugs cost the global economy billions of dollars annually and claim ~50\% of the programming time from software developers. Locating these bugs is crucial for their resolution but challenging. It is even more challenging in deep-learning systems due to their black-box nature. Bugs in these systems are also hidden not only in the code but also in the models and training data, which might make traditional debugging methods less effective. In this article, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the challenges of localizing bugs in deep-learning systems. First, we determine the bug localization performance of four existing techniques using 2,365 bugs from deep-learning systems and 2,913 from traditional software. We found these techniques significantly underperform in localizing deep-learning system bugs. Second, we evaluate how different bug types in deep learning systems impact bug localization. We found that the effectiveness of localization techniques varies with bug type due to their unique challenges. For example, tensor bugs were more accessible to locate due to their structural nature, while all techniques struggled with GPU bugs due to their external dependencies. Third, we investigate the impact of bugs' extrinsic nature on localization in deep-learning systems. We found that deep learning bugs are often extrinsic and thus connected to artifacts other than source code (e.g., GPU, training data), contributing to the poor performance of existing localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Empirical Software Engineering Journal in 2025</p></details> |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Comprehension Benchmark for Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10641v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks. The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability. Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 5 Figures |

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool for Supporting Debugging and Understanding of Normative Requirements Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05504v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |

However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%).

By incorporating external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge graphs, our approach aims to reduce hallucinations and increase the factual accuracy of generated responses. The system provides an interactive experience similar to ChatGPT, tailored specifically for ReservoirPy, enabling users to write, debug, and understand Python code while accessing reliable domain-specific insights. In our evaluation, while proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o and NotebookLM performed slightly better on general knowledge questions, our model outperformed them on coding tasks and showed a significant improvement over its base model, Codestral-22B.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03156v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/15788502.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Deduplicating Compiler Bugs with Bisection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It allows verifying that the students correctly apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students' misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g., no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to configure. To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CompEd'25, 7 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[$T^3$: Multi-level Tree-based Automatic Program Repair with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21211v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks, establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 images, 10 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |
| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Challenges and Practices in Quantum Software Testing and Debugging: Insights from Practitioners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17306v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum software engineering is an emerging discipline with distinct challenges, particularly in testing and debugging. As quantum computing transitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present in classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited observability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific tools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software developers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews focused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants reported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing (54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31% reported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual methods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies, such as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which respondents noted do not scale well. The most frequently cited sources of bugs were classical in nature-library updates (81%), developer mistakes (68%), and compatibility issues (62%)-often worsened by limited abstraction in existing SDKs. These findings highlight the urgent need for better-aligned testing and debugging tools, integrated more seamlessly into the workflows of quantum developers. We present these results in detail and offer actionable recommendations grounded in the real-world needs of practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Tools: How Developers Wield Agentic AI in Real Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the communication challenges that arise in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with participants solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. These results have implications for successful developer-agent collaborations, and for the design of more effective SWE agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Leonh...</summary><p>Leonhard Applis and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios. We hope this work can uncover the potential of LLMs in multi-library debugging scenario and offer insights for future research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Accelerating Delta Debugging through Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11614v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delta debugging assumes search space monotonicity: if a program causes a failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure, permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of the reduction. We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD. Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EASE 2025 (The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, Turkey. 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis) and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging practices.</p></details> |  |

To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |

However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution. Furthermore, 34% of reported issues are quantum-specific, highlighting the need for specialized debugging tools beyond conventional software engineering approaches. This study provides empirical insights into the software engineering challenges of quantum computing, offering recommendations to improve development workflows, tooling, and documentation. We are also open-sourcing our dataset to support further analysis by the community and to guide future research and tool development for quantum computing.

| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Identify Flakiness in C++ Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12340v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of regression testing in software testing is crucial as it ensures that any new modifications do not disrupt the existing functionality and behaviour of the software system. The desired outcome is for regression tests to yield identical results without any modifications made to the system being tested. In practice, however, the presence of Flaky Tests introduces non-deterministic behaviour and undermines the reliability of regression testing results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for identifying the root cause of flaky tests in C++ projects at the code level, with the intention of assisting developers in debugging and resolving them more efficiently. We compile a comprehensive collection of C++ project flaky tests sourced from GitHub repositories. We fine-tune Mistral-7b, Llama2-7b and CodeLlama-7b models on the C++ dataset and an existing Java dataset and evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We assess the performance of the models across various datasets and offer recommendations for both research and industry applications. The results indicate that our models exhibit varying performance on the C++ dataset, while their performance is comparable to that of the Java dataset. The Mistral-7b surpasses the other two models regarding all metrics, achieving a score of 1. Our results demonstrate the exceptional capability of LLMs to accurately classify flakiness in C++ and Java projects, providing a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of debugging flaky tests in practice.</p></details> |  |

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM-Based Fault Localization with External Memory and Project Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03585v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 7 figures |

However, existing debuggers are primarily tailored for human interaction, and those designed for programmatic debugging focus on kernel space, resulting in limited functionality in userland. To fill this gap, we introduce libdebug, a Python library for programmatic debugging of userland binary executables. libdebug offers a user-friendly API that enables developers to build custom debugging tools for various applications, including software engineering, reverse engineering, and software security. It is released as an open-source project, along with comprehensive documentation to encourage use and collaboration across the community. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of libdebug through case studies and benchmarks, all of which are publicly available. We find that the median latency of syscall and breakpoint handling in libdebug is 3 to 4 times lower compared to that of GDB.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |

LadyBug connects to an Android app's GitHub repository, and is triggered when a bug is reported in the corresponding issue tracker. Developers can then record a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the project that most likely contain the reported bug. We empirically evaluated LadyBug using an automated testing pipeline and benchmark called RedWing that contains 80 fully-localized and reproducible bug reports from 39 Android apps. Our results illustrate that LadyBug outperforms text-retrieval-based baselines and that the utilization of UI information leads to a substantial increase in localization accuracy.

| **[Automated Bug Frame Retrieval from Gameplay Videos Using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04895v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern game studios deliver new builds and patches at a rapid pace, generating thousands of bug reports, many of which embed gameplay videos. To verify and triage these bug reports, developers must watch the submitted videos. This manual review is labour-intensive, slow, and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a single frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers instant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug. Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video to a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug moments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a vision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match the textual bug description and selects the most representative frame. We evaluated this approach using real-world developer-submitted gameplay videos and JIRA bug reports from a popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. The pipeline achieves an overall F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the top-1 retrieved frame. Performance is highest for the Lighting & Shadow (F1 = 0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories, and lowest for Animation & VFX (0.51). By replacing video viewing with an immediately informative image, our approach dramatically reduces manual effort and speeds up triage and regression checks, offering practical benefits to quality assurance (QA) teams and developers across the game industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Versus Static Code Analysis Tools: A Systematic Benchmark for Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04448v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software relies on a multitude of automated testing and quality assurance tools to prevent errors, bugs and potential vulnerabilities. This study sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based static code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three state-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform (GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten real-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories such as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure classical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency, and the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based scanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their static counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs' advantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason across broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial trade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language models mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation artefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static analysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and imprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We therefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in development for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic rule-based scanners for high-assurance verification. The open benchmark and JSON-based result harness released with this paper lay a foundation for reproducible, practitioner-centric research into next-generation automated code security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool-integrated Reinforcement Learning for Repo Deep Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03012v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level localization. The results also show that improved localization performance translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective strategy for improving automated software development.</p></details> |  |

However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |

We introduce ReFuzzer, a framework for refining LLM-generated test programs by systematically detecting and correcting compilation and runtime violations (e.g. division by zero or array out-of-bounds accesses). ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local LLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving fuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of diverse yet valid test programs. We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box fuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs' validity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of 2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing significantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR generation components. For example, vectorization coverage had an absolute improvement of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 7.1% in black-, grey-, and white-box fuzzing, enhancing testing effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Since such code clones, i.e., identical or similar fragments of code, can bloat software projects and cause issues like bug or vulnerability propagation, their identification is of importance. In this paper, we present the StoneDetector platform and its underlying method for finding code clones in Java source and Bytecode. StoneDetector implements a conventional clone detection approach based upon the textual comparison of paths derived from the code's representation by dominator trees. In this way, the tool does not only find exact and syntactically similar near-miss code clones, but also code clones that are harder to detect due to their larger variety in the syntax. We demonstrate StoneDetector's versatility as a conventional clone detection platform and analyze its various available configuration parameters, including the usage of different string metrics, hashing algorithms, etc. In our exhaustive evaluation with other conventional clone detectors on several state-of-the-art benchmarks, we can show StoneDetector's performance and scalability in finding code clones in both, Java source and Bytecode.</p></details> | <details><summary>suppl...</summary><p>supplementary information available at https://stonedetector.fmi.uni-jena.de/</p></details> |

Mainstream benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores, limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g., chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including 14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis, symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.</p></details> |  |

This new model pairs up one Junior PC member with two regular PC members as part of the core review team of a given paper, instead of adding them as an extra reviewer. This paper presents the rationale, implementation, and reflections on the model, including empirical insights from a post-review author survey evaluating the quality and usefulness of reviews.

These models have diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine, and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately enhancing the programming experience.</p></details> |  |

We propose R2Vul, a method that combines reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) and structured reasoning distillation to teach small code LLMs to detect vulnerabilities while generating security-aware explanations. Unlike prior chain-of-thought and instruction tuning approaches, R2Vul rewards well-founded over deceptively plausible vulnerability explanations through RLAIF, which results in more precise detection and high-quality reasoning generation. To support RLAIF, we construct the first multilingual preference dataset for vulnerability detection, comprising 18,000 high-quality samples in C\#, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C. We evaluate R2Vul across five programming languages and against four static analysis tools, eight state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines, and various fine-tuning approaches. Our results demonstrate that a 1.5B R2Vul model exceeds the performance of its 32B teacher model and leading commercial LLMs such as Claude-4-Opus. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight calibration step that reduces false positive rates under varying imbalanced data distributions. Finally, through qualitative analysis, we show that both LLM and human evaluators consistently rank R2Vul model's reasoning higher than other reasoning-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ACM/IEEE MODELS'25</p></details> |

Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over $\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors' performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly noisy distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVOC2RUST: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rust's compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical systems, creating demand for translating legacy C codebases to Rust. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the function, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in project-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32% improvements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches, along with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools. At the module level, EvoC2Rust reaches 92.25% compilation and 89.53% test pass rates on industrial projects, even for complex codebases and long functions.</p></details> |  |

While code generation using LLMs has become a popular field of research, code evaluation using LLMs remains under-explored. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We propose multi-agentic novel approaches using \emph{question-specific rubrics} tailored to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical assessment than the existing approaches that use \emph{question-agnostic rubrics}. To address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics (Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that \emph{question-specific rubrics} significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond mere syntactic correctness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICER 2025</p></details> |

Many existing evaluation frameworks address technical aspects such as code correctness and efficiency, but often overlook crucial human factors that affect the successful integration of AI assistants in software development workflows. In this study, I analyzed GitHub Copilot's interaction with users through its chat interface, measured Copilot's ability to adapt explanations and code generation to user expertise levels, and assessed its effectiveness in facilitating collaborative programming experiences. I established a human-centered requirements framework with clear metrics to evaluate these qualities in GitHub Copilot chat. I discussed the test results and their implications for future analysis of human requirements in automated programming.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Intent Preserving Generation of Diverse and Idiomatic (Code-)Artifacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03642v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When automatically generating programming exercise tasks one often also needs to automatically generate programs. At the very least when providing sample solutions is part of automated feedback. But programs can also be used as part of the exercise task description to communicate a task's requirements. Writing good program generators that produce varied yet idiomatic code while being easily adaptable for new tasks is challenging. The challenges are intensified if task generation requires additional artifacts, like a more general behavior specification for testing or additional textual descriptions. Manually writing generators for multiple different but strongly related artifacts gets complicated quickly. We present an approach where instead of writing monolithic generators for multiple connected artifacts one specifies a small set of abstract building blocks and for each such building block defines sets of concrete realizations for various kinds of artifacts. Then the intended structure of the resulting artifacts is specified as a composition of the small abstract building blocks. This abstract description then serves as the common source from which related artifacts can be derived automatically. The approach is generic in the kind of artifacts it can produce and is therefore adaptable to a wide range of contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |
| **[Visual Execution and Validation of Finite-State Machines and Pushdown Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03641v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Formal Languages and Automata Theory courses, students find understanding nondeterministic finite-state and pushdown automata difficult. In many cases, this means that it is challenging for them to comprehend the operational semantics of such machines and, as a consequence, determine why a word is accepted or rejected. This is not entirely surprising, because students are mostly trained to design and implement deterministic programs. Comprehension of pushdown automata is further complicated, because reasoning about the stack is necessary. A common difficulty students face, for example, is understanding that two different computations on the same word may reach the same state with different stack values. To aid student understanding, we present two novel dynamic visualization tools for FSM -- a domain-specific programming language for the Automata Theory classroom -- to support the design of such machines. These tools visualize all computations that may be performed, respectively, by a nondeterministic finite-state machine or by a pushdown automata in a stepwise manner. In addition, these tools aid the machine verification process by allowing users to visually validate whether the properties a state represents hold when a machine transitions into it.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |

This framework includes a design recipe for regular expressions and a customized error messaging system. The error messaging system produces recipe-based errors that include the step of the design recipe not successfully completed. Furthermore, the error messages follow the established practices of being concise, succinct, jargon-free, and nonprescriptive. In addition, a shorthand syntax developed for writing unit tests is described. The in-class use of the design recipe is illustrated, two debugging sessions using the described system are discussed, and the implementation of the error messaging system is briefly sketched.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |
| **[Design Support for Multitape Turing Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03638v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Formal Languages and Automata Theory courses introduce students to Turing machine extensions. One of the most widely-used extensions endows Turing machines with multiple tapes. Although multitape Turing machines are an abstraction to simplify Turing machine design, students find them no less challenging. To aid students in understanding these machines, the FSM programming language provides support for their definition and execution. This, however, has proven insufficient for many students to understand the operational semantics of such machines and to understand why such machines accept or reject a word. To address this problem, three visualization tools have been developed. The first is a dynamic visualization tool that simulates machine execution. The second is a static visualization tool that automatically renders a graphic for a multitape Turing machine's transition diagram. The third is a static visualization tool that automatically renders computation graphs for multitape Turing machines. This article presents these tools and illustrates how they are used to help students design and implement multitape Turing machines. In addition, empirical data is presented that suggests these tools are well-received and found useful by students.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |
| **[ReFuzzer: Feedback-Driven Approach to Enhance Validity of LLM-Generated Test Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03603v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM-based compiler fuzzers often produce syntactically or semantically invalid test programs, limiting their effectiveness in exercising compiler optimizations and backend components. We introduce ReFuzzer, a framework for refining LLM-generated test programs by systematically detecting and correcting compilation and runtime violations (e.g. division by zero or array out-of-bounds accesses). ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local LLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving fuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of diverse yet valid test programs. We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box fuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs' validity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of 2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing significantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR generation components. For example, vectorization coverage had an absolute improvement of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 7.1% in black-, grey-, and white-box fuzzing, enhancing testing effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[MalFlows: Context-aware Fusion of Heterogeneous Flow Semantics for Android Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03588v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis, a fundamental technique in Android app examination, enables the extraction of control flows, data flows, and inter-component communications (ICCs), all of which are essential for malware detection. However, existing methods struggle to leverage the semantic complementarity across different types of flows for representing program behaviors, and their context-unaware nature further hinders the accuracy of cross-flow semantic integration. We propose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware fusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal is to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related information for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We further propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that distinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual constraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations through the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally fed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively aggregate the strengths of diverse flow-related information for assessing maliciousness within apps. We evaluate MalFlows on a large-scale dataset comprising over 20 million flow instances extracted from more than 31,000 real-world apps. Experimental results demonstrate that MalFlows outperforms representative baselines in Android malware detection, and meanwhile, validate the effectiveness of flow2vec in accurately learning app representations from the HIN constructed over the heterogeneous flows.</p></details> | Submitted to TDSC |
| **[On the Evaluation of Large Language Models in Multilingual Vulnerability Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03470v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various Deep Learning-based approaches with pre-trained language models have been proposed for automatically repairing software vulnerabilities. However, these approaches are limited to a specific programming language (C/C++). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities and strong semantic understanding, exhibiting potential to overcome multilingual vulnerability limitations. Although some work has begun to explore LLMs' repair performance, their effectiveness is unsatisfactory. To address these limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate the performance of automated vulnerability repair approaches and state-of-the-art LLMs across seven programming languages. Results show GPT-4o, instruction-tuned with few-shot prompting, performs competitively against the leading approach, VulMaster. Additionally, the LLM-based approach shows superior performance in repairing unique vulnerabilities and is more likely to repair the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Instruction-tuned GPT-4o demonstrates strong generalization on vulnerabilities in previously unseen language, outperforming existing approaches. Analysis shows Go consistently achieves the highest effectiveness across all model types, while C/C++ performs the worst. Based on findings, we discuss the promise of LLM on multilingual vulnerability repair and the reasons behind LLM's failed cases. This work takes the first look at repair approaches and LLMs across multiple languages, highlighting the promising future of adopting LLMs for multilingual vulnerability repair.</p></details> |  |

Since such code clones, i.e., identical or similar fragments of code, can bloat software projects and cause issues like bug or vulnerability propagation, their identification is of importance. In this paper, we present the StoneDetector platform and its underlying method for finding code clones in Java source and Bytecode. StoneDetector implements a conventional clone detection approach based upon the textual comparison of paths derived from the code's representation by dominator trees. In this way, the tool does not only find exact and syntactically similar near-miss code clones, but also code clones that are harder to detect due to their larger variety in the syntax. We demonstrate StoneDetector's versatility as a conventional clone detection platform and analyze its various available configuration parameters, including the usage of different string metrics, hashing algorithms, etc. In our exhaustive evaluation with other conventional clone detectors on several state-of-the-art benchmarks, we can show StoneDetector's performance and scalability in finding code clones in both, Java source and Bytecode.</p></details> | <details><summary>suppl...</summary><p>supplementary information available at https://stonedetector.fmi.uni-jena.de/</p></details> |

However, these users often face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e., the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in UIST 2025</p></details> |
| **[Key-Augmented Neural Triggers for Knowledge Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03340v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code comprehension and knowledge sharing remain core challenges in software engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise by generating explanations of program structure and logic. However, these approaches still face limitations: First, relevant knowledge is distributed across multiple files within a repository, aka semantic fragmentation. Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade performance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm attention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often outdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented Neural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into both training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access to repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding inference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data directly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context, reducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise deployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the synthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions; compare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference speed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability. Results show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking needs. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack expert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to 85% across all models. Overall, it is well-suited for scalable, low-latency, on-premise deployments, providing a strong foundation for code comprehension.</p></details> |  |

Their application to quantum software development remains limited, in part because of the lack of high-quality datasets both for LLM training and as dependable knowledge sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce PennyLang, an off-the-shelf, high-quality dataset of 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples with contextual descriptions, curated from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the creation and open-source release of PennyLang, a purpose-built dataset for quantum programming with PennyLane; (2) a framework for automated quantum code dataset construction that systematizes curation, annotation, and formatting to maximize downstream LLM usability; and (3) a baseline evaluation of the dataset across multiple open-source models, including ablation studies, all conducted within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Using PennyLang with RAG substantially improves performance: for example, Qwen 7B's success rate rises from 8.7% without retrieval to 41.7% with full-context augmentation, and LLaMa 4 improves from 78.8% to 84.8%, while also reducing hallucinations and enhancing quantum code correctness. Moving beyond Qiskit-focused studies, we bring LLM-based tools and reproducible methods to PennyLane for advancing AI-assisted quantum development.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[A System Model Generation Benchmark from Natural Language Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03215v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System models, a critical artifact in software development, provide a formal abstraction of both the structural and behavioral aspects of software systems, which can facilitate the early requirements analysis and architecture design. However, developing system models remains challenging due to the specific syntax of model description languages and the relative scarcity of public model examples. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating code with programming languages and could potentially aid in system model development, no benchmarks currently exist for evaluating their ability to generate system models with specific description languages. We present SysMBench, which comprises 151 human-curated scenarios spanning a wide range of popular domains and varying difficulty levels. Each scenario mainly comprises a natural language requirements description, a system model expressed in a specific model description language, and a visualized system model diagram. The requirements description is fed as user input to the LLM, the system model with description language is used to verify if the generated system model conforms to the requirements, and the visualized diagram serves to support manual validation. We introduce SysMEval, a semantic-aware evaluation metric to evaluate the quality of generated system models. We evaluate 17 popular LLMs on this task with three traditional metrics and SysMEval, from directly prompting to three commonly used enhancement strategies. Our in-depth evaluation shows that LLMs perform poorly on SysMBench, with the highest BLEU of 4% and SysMEval-F1 of 62%. We release the SysMBench and its evaluation framework to enable future research on LLM-based system model generation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[MRG-Bench: Evaluating and Exploring the Requirements of Context for Repository-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02998v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation. However, current evaluation datasets suffer from issues such as the lack of runnable test cases, deviation from the distribution of real-world code, and the ability to evaluate only the Python language. These limitations undermine the credibility of the evaluation results. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MRG-Bench} (Multi-language Repository-level Code Generation Benchmark), a novel dataset that provides a more accurate evaluation of LLMs in practical repository-level code generation tasks. MRG-Bench has three main features: (1) practical data sourced from real-world code repositories that align to the practical distribution, (2) multiple programming languages support, including Python, Java, and Go, and (3) project-level runnable test cases to assess the quality of the generated code. Based on MRG-Bench, we conducted extensive experiments including large language models, long-context models, and RAG-related methods. These evaluation results demonstrate that \textbf{current repository-level code generation techniques suffer from significant performance deficiencies}. To further investigate why models fail, we designed novel experiments to annotate the underlying causes of generation errors. The results explicitly show that the majority of methods suffer from "\textbf{difficulty in understanding user requirements}," failing to comprehend their assigned tasks accurately. Moreover, the impact of different repository-level contexts on this issue exhibits significant disparities across different programming languages, suggesting that, in practice, specialized contextual information needs to be designed for different languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Validation of LLM-based Evaluators for Software Engineering Artifacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02827v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However, establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality. We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation), an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with expected ordering. A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps. While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks. These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams to support model release decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Code Repair for C/C++ Static Analysis Alerts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02820v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(Note: This work is a preprint.) Static analysis (SA) tools produce many diagnostic alerts indicating that source code in C or C++ may be defective and potentially vulnerable to security exploits. Many of these alerts are false positives. Identifying the true-positive alerts and repairing the defects in the associated code are huge efforts that automated program repair (APR) tools can help with. Our experience showed us that APR can reduce the number of SA alerts significantly and reduce the manual effort of analysts to review code. This engineering experience paper details the application of design, development, and performance testing to an APR tool we built that repairs C/C++ code associated with 3 categories of alerts produced by multiple SA tools. Its repairs are simple and local. Furthermore, our findings convinced the maintainers of the CERT Coding Standards to re-assess and update the metrics used to assess when violations of guidelines are detectable or repairable. We discuss engineering design choices made to support goals of trustworthiness and acceptability to developers. Our APR tool repaired 8718 out of 9234 alerts produced by one SA tool on one codebase. It can repair 3 flaw categories. For 2 flaw categories, 2 SA tools, and 2 codebases, our tool repaired or dismissed as false positives over 80% of alerts, on average. Tests showed repairs did not appreciably degrade the performance of the code or cause new alerts to appear (with the possible exception of sqlite3.c). This paper describes unique contributions that include a new empirical analysis of SA data, our selection method for flaw categories to repair, publication of our APR tool, and a dataset of SA alerts from open-source SA tools run on open-source codebases. It discusses positive and negative results and lessons learned.</p></details> |  |

As organizations increasingly depend on OSS, understanding project evolution is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience -- the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures, security vulnerabilities, and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns reflect underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes that enable resilience. Building on the Composite Stability Index (CSI) framework, we empirically validate commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked repositories. Our findings reveal that only 2\% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29\% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while half remain unstable across all temporal levels. Programming languages and blockchain applications were the most stable. We identified two exemplary repositories that achieved stability at all three granularities, whose governance models, CI cadence, and release policies could serve as reference frameworks. We observed that large yearly commit throughput does not necessarily correlate with stability. Beyond commits, stability can be enriched with issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community-engagement metrics to broaden resilience assessment and sharpen stability-based risk evaluation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AIAP, a no-code platform that integrates natural language input with visual workflows. AIAP leverages a coordinated multi-agent system to decompose ambiguous user instructions into modular, actionable steps, hidden from users behind a unified interface. A user study involving 32 participants showed that AIAP's AI-generated suggestions, modular workflows, and automatic identification of data, actions, and context significantly improved participants' ability to develop services intuitively. These findings highlight that natural language-based visual programming significantly reduces barriers and enhances user experience in AI service design.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Do AI models help produce verified bug fixes?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15822v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |

As these APIs grow in complexity and scale, ensuring their correctness and robustness becomes increasingly important. Automated testing is essential for identifying hidden bugs, particularly those that appear in edge cases or under unexpected inputs. However, creating comprehensive and effective test suites for REST APIs is challenging and often demands significant effort. In this paper, we investigate the use of large language model (LLM) systems, both single-agent and multi-agent setups, for amplifying existing REST API test suites. These systems generate additional test cases that aim to push the boundaries of the API, uncovering behaviors that might otherwise go untested. We present a comparative evaluation of the two approaches across several dimensions, including test coverage, bug detection effectiveness, and practical considerations such as computational cost and energy usage. Our evaluation demonstrates increased API coverage, identification of numerous bugs in the API under test, and insights into the computational cost and energy consumption of both approaches.</p></details> |  |

To investigate this gap, we conducted a two-phase study. First, we interviewed 35 professional developers from three user groups (Adopters, Churners, and Non-Users) to uncover unmet needs and expectations. Our analysis revealed five key areas: Technology Improvement, Interaction, and Alignment, as well as Simplifying Skill Building, and Programming Tasks. We then examined the feasibility of addressing selected needs through an internal prediction market involving 102 practitioners. The results demonstrate a strong alignment between the developers' needs and the practitioners' judgment for features focused on implementation and context awareness. However, features related to proactivity and maintenance remain both underestimated and technically unaddressed. Our findings reveal gaps in current AI support and provide practical directions for developing more effective and sustainable in-IDE AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 1 table submitted to ASE Industry Showcase 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional testing approaches -- typically executed separately via CLI -- isolate tests from HIDE tooling (interactive debuggers, value and stack inspectors, etc.) and introduce disruptive delays due to coarse execution granularity and lack of runtime context. This disconnect breaks development flow by exceeding critical attention thresholds. In this paper we present a library that provides runtime representation for tests, allowing tight integration with HIDEs, and enabling immediate access to HIDE tooling in the context of test failure. We then describe development workflows enhanced with testing and demonstrate how they achieve subsecond test reexecution times crucial for maintaining developer focus.</p></details> | 12 pages, ICFP-2025 |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.

These issues fall into two categories: version compatibility issues (VCIs) and code compatibility issues (CCIs). Existing tools mainly detect dependency conflicts but overlook code-level incompatibilities, with no solution fully automating the inference of compatible versions for both VCIs and CCIs. To fill this gap, we propose PCREQ, the first approach to automatically infer compatible requirements by combining version and code compatibility analysis. PCREQ integrates six modules: knowledge acquisition, version compatibility assessment, invoked APIs and modules extraction, code compatibility assessment, version change, and missing TPL completion. PCREQ collects candidate versions, checks for conflicts, identifies API usage, evaluates code compatibility, and iteratively adjusts versions to generate a compatible requirements.txt with a detailed repair report. To evaluate PCREQ, we construct REQBench, a large-scale benchmark with 2,095 upgrade test cases (including 406 unsolvable by pip). Results show PCREQ achieves a 94.03% inference success rate, outperforming PyEGo (37.02%), ReadPyE (37.16%), and LLM-based approaches (GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3/R1) by 18-20%. PCREQ processes each case from REQBench in 60.79s on average, demonstrating practical efficiency. PCREQ significantly reduces manual effort in troubleshooting upgrades, advancing Python dependency maintenance automation.</p></details> | 52 pages, 33 figures |
| **[Flow Sensitivity without Control Flow Graph: An Efficient Andersen-Style Flow-Sensitive Pointer Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01974v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-sensitive pointer analysis constitutes an essential component of precise program analysis for accurately modeling pointer behaviors by incorporating control flows. Flow-sensitive pointer analysis is extensively used in alias analysis, taint analysis, program understanding, compiler optimization, etc. Existing flow-sensitive pointer analysis approaches, which are conducted based on control flow graphs, have significantly advanced the precision of pointer analysis via sophisticated techniques to leverage control flow information. However, they inevitably suffer from computational inefficiencies when resolving points-to information due to the inherent complex structures of control flow graphs. We present CG-FSPTA, a Flow-Sensitive Constraint Graph (FSConsG) based flow-sensitive pointer analysis to overcome the inefficiency of control-flow-graph-based analysis. CG-FSPTA uses a flow-sensitive variant to leverage the structural advantages of set-constraint graphs (which are commonly used in flow-insensitive pointer analysis) while keeping the flow sensitivity of variable definitions and uses, allowing the incorporation of sophisticated graph optimization and dynamic solving techniques. In this way, CG-FSPTA achieves significant efficiency improvements while keeping the precision of flow-sensitive analysis. Experimental evaluations on benchmark programs demonstrate that CG-FSPTA, significantly reduces both memory usage and execution time while maintaining precision. In particular, by solving in the FSConsG, CG-FSPTA achieves an average memory reduction of 33.05\% and accelerates flow-sensitive pointer analysis by 7.27x compared to the state-of-art method. These experimental results underscore the efficacy of CG-FSPTA as a scalable solution to analyze large-scale software systems, establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in efficient program analysis frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Assisted Model-Based Fuzzing of Protocol Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01750v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the reliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in protocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially in real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol testing involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state transitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such models typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort, making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse protocols and implementations. We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations. Our approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from which the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this state-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences of states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The sequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol implementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three widely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported them to the respective developers for confirmation. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our LLM-assisted fuzzing framework in uncovering real-world security issues.</p></details> |  |

While existing static analysis tools can detect simple obfuscation techniques like variable renaming and dead code injection, they fail against sophisticated deep obfuscation methods such as encrypted code with local or cloud-based decryption keys that completely destroy code structure and render traditional Abstract Syntax Tree analysis ineffective. To address these challenges, we present JSidentify-V2, a novel dynamic analysis framework that detects mini-game plagiarism by capturing memory invariants during program execution. Our key insight is that while obfuscation can severely distort static code characteristics, runtime memory behavior patterns remain relatively stable. JSidentify-V2 employs a four-stage pipeline: (1) static pre-analysis and instrumentation to identify potential memory invariants, (2) adaptive hot object slicing to maximize execution coverage of critical code segments, (3) Memory Dependency Graph construction to represent behavioral fingerprints resilient to obfuscation, and (4) graph-based similarity analysis for plagiarism detection. We evaluate JSidentify-V2 against eight obfuscation methods on a comprehensive dataset of 1,200 mini-games ...</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, major vendors implement ST with proprietary extensions and hardware-specific libraries - Siemens' SCL and CODESYS' ST each differ in syntax and functionality. This fragmentation forces engineers to relearn implementation details across platforms, creating substantial productivity barriers. To address this challenge, we developed AutoPLC, a framework capable of automatically generating vendor-aware ST code directly from natural language requirements. Our solution begins by building two essential knowledge sources tailored to each vendor's specifications: a structured API library containing platform-exclusive functions, and an annotated case database that captures real-world implementation experience. Building on these foundations, we created a four-stage generation process that combines step-wise planning (enhanced with a lightweight natural language state machine support for control logic), contextual case retrieval using LLM-based reranking, API recommendation guided by industrial data, and dynamic validation through direct interaction with vendor IDEs. Implemented for Siemens TIA Portal and the CODESYS platform, AutoPLC achieves 90%+ compilation success on our 914-task benchmark (covering general-purpose and process control functions), outperforming all selected baselines, at an average cost of only $0.13 per task. Experienced PLC engineers positively assessed the practical utility of the generated code, including cases that failed compilation. We open-source our framework at https://github.com/cangkui/AutoPLC.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Directed Grammar-Based Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01472v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To effectively test complex software, it is important to generate goal-specific inputs, i.e., inputs that achieve a specific testing goal. However, most state-of-the-art test generators are not designed to target specific goals. Notably, grammar-based test generators, which (randomly) produce syntactically valid inputs via an input specification (i.e., grammar) have a low probability of achieving an arbitrary testing goal. This work addresses this challenge by proposing an automated test generation approach (called FdLoop) which iteratively learns relevant input properties from existing inputs to drive the generation of goal-specific inputs. Given a testing goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input distribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic grammar. We concretize FdLoop for four testing goals, namely unique code coverage, input-to-code complexity, program failures (exceptions) and long execution time. We evaluate FdLoop using three (3) well-known input formats (JSON, CSS and JavaScript) and 20 open-source software. In most (86%) settings, FdLoop outperforms all five tested baselines namely the baseline grammar-based test generators (random, probabilistic and inverse-probabilistic methods), EvoGFuzz and DynaMosa. FdLoop is (up to) twice (2X) as effective as the best baseline (EvoGFuzz) in inducing erroneous behaviors. In addition, we show that the main components of FdLoop (i.e., input mutator, grammar mutator and test feedbacks) contribute positively to its effectiveness. Finally, our evaluation demonstrates that FdLoop effectively achieves single testing goals (revealing erroneous behaviors, generating complex inputs, or inducing long execution time) and scales to multiple testing goals across varying parameter settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, for replication package, see https://tinyurl.com/FDLoop-V3</p></details> |
| **[Think Broad, Act Narrow: CWE Identification with Multi-Agent Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01451v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection has received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even distinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to three main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs often struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques typically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability detection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus on binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but associating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead developers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the challenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a team of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the function under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external context to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes informed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered context. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In the PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\% of the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on ten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information significantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while still correctly identifying the true CWE in 9 out of 10 cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyClone: Bridging LLM Understanding and Dynamic Execution for Semantic Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01357v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at identifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software systems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence, particularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement identical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code semantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields suboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines LLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic clones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to filter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not identified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation approach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence through cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct LLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying semantic clones. Future work includes exploring cross-language clone detection and optimizing the framework for large-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[TestWeaver: Execution-aware, Feedback-driven Regression Testing Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01255v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regression testing ensures that code changes do not unintentionally break existing functionality. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they often suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in stagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this paper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates lightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively. TestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and improves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target line instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close test cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the target line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and (3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode variable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these targeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test generation and mitigates redundant explorations. Empirical results demonstrate that TestWeaver accelerates code coverage growth and generates more effective regression test cases than existing LLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01249v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools & data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing Expert Proof-Writing Processes in F* and Verus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02733v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proof-oriented programming languages (POPLs) empower developers to write code alongside formal correctness proofs, providing formal guarantees that the code adheres to specified requirements. Despite their powerful capabilities, POPLs present a steep learning curve and have not yet been adopted by the broader software community. The lack of understanding about the proof-development process and how expert proof developers interact with POPLs has hindered the advancement of effective proof engineering and the development of proof-synthesis models/tools. In this work, we conduct a user study, involving the collection and analysis of fine-grained source code telemetry from eight experts working with two languages, F* and Verus. Results reveal interesting trends and patterns about how experts reason about proofs and key challenges encountered during the proof development process. We identify three distinct strategies and multiple informal practices that are not captured final code snapshots, yet are predictive of task outcomes. We translate these findings into concrete design guidance for AI proof assistants: bias toward early specification drafting, explicit sub-goal decomposition, bounded active errors, and disciplined verifier interaction. We also present a case study of an F* proof agent grounded in these recommendations, and demonstrate improved performance over baseline LLMs</p></details> |  |

The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We make available our benchmark and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench and project homepage at https://xyzcs.github.io/scireplicate.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).</p></details> | <details><summary>*Firs...</summary><p>*First three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |

While these aspects are usually studied in depth separately, it is also important to carry out broader large-scale studies that touch on many topics, because they allow us to put different results into each other's perspective. Past large-scale surveys have provided valuable insights, however, the emergence of new trends (e.g., AI), new learning formats (e.g., in-IDE learning), and the increasing learner diversity highlight the need for an updated comprehensive study. To address this, we conducted a survey with 18,032 learners from 173 countries, ensuring diverse representation and exploring a wide range of topics - formal education, learning formats, AI usage, challenges, motivation, and more. This paper introduces the results of this survey as an open dataset, describes our methodology and the survey questions, and highlights, as a motivating example, three possible research directions within this data: challenges in learning, emerging formats, and insights into the in-IDE format.

EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93% functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing .NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96% semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90% compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance preservation, and integration evolution.

| **[STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench: Evaluating Complex Multi-Function Comprehension and Fine-Grained Execution Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05193v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code intelligence, yet systematically evaluating their code understanding and reasoning abilities remains challenging. Mainstream benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores, limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g., chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including 14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis, symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-assisted JSON Schema Creation and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05192v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models at the core of system and data engineering processes. In the context of research data, these models are typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data integration for non-experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Tools and Demonstrations Track of ACM/IEEE MODELS'25</p></details> |
| **[Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a systematic survey of the application of RL in code optimization and generation, highlighting its role in enhancing compiler optimization, resource allocation, and the development of frameworks and tools. Subsequent sections first delve into the intricate processes of compiler optimization, where RL algorithms are leveraged to improve efficiency and resource utilization. The discussion then progresses to the function of RL in resource allocation, emphasizing register allocation and system optimization. We also explore the burgeoning role of frameworks and tools in code generation, examining how RL can be integrated to bolster their capabilities. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in harnessing the power of RL to advance code generation and optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |

While these hardware-based solutions offer strong protection in isolated environments, their effectiveness is being undermined by cloud-native threats such as misconfigurations, compromised APIs, and lateral privilege escalations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of publicly disclosed attacks and breaches involving HSMs and TPMs in cloud environments, identifying recurring architectural and operational flaws. We propose a taxonomy of attack vectors based on real-world case studies and threat intelligence reports, highlighting the gaps between hardware trust anchors and dynamic cloud ecosystems. Furthermore, we evaluate emerging defensive paradigms: confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management systems (dKMS), assessing their potential to address these gaps. Our findings emphasize that securing cloud-based cryptographic trust requires a layered, context-aware approach that integrates both hardware and software safeguards. The study serves as a practical framework for cloud architects and security engineers to reassess key protection strategies in light of evolving threats. To our knowledge, this is the first work to synthesize documented, real-world cloud HSM and TPM failures into a coherent taxonomy grounded in modern threat models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 Flowcharts, 2 Tables</p></details> |

LadyBug connects to an Android app's GitHub repository, and is triggered when a bug is reported in the corresponding issue tracker. Developers can then record a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the project that most likely contain the reported bug. We empirically evaluated LadyBug using an automated testing pipeline and benchmark called RedWing that contains 80 fully-localized and reproducible bug reports from 39 Android apps. Our results illustrate that LadyBug outperforms text-retrieval-based baselines and that the utilization of UI information leads to a substantial increase in localization accuracy. LadyBug is an open-source tool, available at https://github.com/LadyBugML/ladybug.

| **[An ML-based Approach to Predicting Software Change Dependencies: Insights from an Empirical Study on OpenStack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05034v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it. Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment. They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes, while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33% and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k precision has room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

Building upon the International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) community's earlier experience with a Shadow PC (2021 and 2022) and Junior PC (2023 and 2024), MSR 2025 experimented with a Blended Program Committee (PC) peer review model for its Technical Track. This new model pairs up one Junior PC member with two regular PC members as part of the core review team of a given paper, instead of adding them as an extra reviewer. This paper presents the rationale, implementation, and reflections on the model, including empirical insights from a post-review author survey evaluating the quality and usefulness of reviews. Our findings highlight the potential of a Blended PC to alleviate reviewer shortages, foster inclusivity, and sustain a high-quality peer review process. We offer lessons learned and recommendations to guide future adoption and refinement of the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes</p></details> |
| **[Generative AI for Object-Oriented Programming: Writing the Right Code and Reasoning the Right Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05005v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We find ourselves in the midst of an explosion in artificial intelligence research, particularly with large language models (LLMs). These models have diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine, and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately enhancing the programming experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[R2Vul: Learning to Reason about Software Vulnerabilities with Reinforcement Learning and Structured Reasoning Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04699v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in software vulnerability detection, yet their reasoning capabilities remain unreliable. We propose R2Vul, a method that combines reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) and structured reasoning distillation to teach small code LLMs to detect vulnerabilities while generating security-aware explanations. Unlike prior chain-of-thought and instruction tuning approaches, R2Vul rewards well-founded over deceptively plausible vulnerability explanations through RLAIF, which results in more precise detection and high-quality reasoning generation. To support RLAIF, we construct the first multilingual preference dataset for vulnerability detection, comprising 18,000 high-quality samples in C\#, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C. We evaluate R2Vul across five programming languages and against four static analysis tools, eight state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines, and various fine-tuning approaches. Our results demonstrate that a 1.5B R2Vul model exceeds the performance of its 32B teacher model and leading commercial LLMs such as Claude-4-Opus. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight calibration step that reduces false positive rates under varying imbalanced data distributions. Finally, through qualitative analysis, we show that both LLM and human evaluators consistently rank R2Vul model's reasoning higher than other reasoning-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomy of Faults in Attention-Based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04925v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96 projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.</p></details> |  |

Without clear frameworks, communities risk being overwhelmed by the complexity and ambiguity introduced by GenAI, threatening the collaborative ethos that underpins OSS. We conduct a scenario-driven, conceptual exploration using a socio-technical framework inspired by McLuhan's Tetrad to surface both risks and opportunities for community resilience amid GenAI-driven disruption of OSS development across four domains: software practices, documentation, community engagement, and governance. By adopting this lens, OSS leaders and researchers can proactively shape the future of their ecosystems, rather than simply reacting to technological upheaval.</p></details> | 13 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Automated Bug Frame Retrieval from Gameplay Videos Using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04895v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern game studios deliver new builds and patches at a rapid pace, generating thousands of bug reports, many of which embed gameplay videos. To verify and triage these bug reports, developers must watch the submitted videos. This manual review is labour-intensive, slow, and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a single frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers instant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug. Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video to a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug moments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a vision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match the textual bug description and selects the most representative frame. We evaluated this approach using real-world developer-submitted gameplay videos and JIRA bug reports from a popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. The pipeline achieves an overall F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the top-1 retrieved frame. Performance is highest for the Lighting & Shadow (F1 = 0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories, and lowest for Animation & VFX (0.51). By replacing video viewing with an immediately informative image, our approach dramatically reduces manual effort and speeds up triage and regression checks, offering practical benefits to quality assurance (QA) teams and developers across the game industry.</p></details> |  |

We present Graffiti, a system that can be used to build a wide variety of personalized social applications with relative ease that also interoperate with each other. People can freely move between a plurality of designs -- each with its own aesthetic, feature set, and moderation -- all without losing their friends or data. Our concept of total reification makes it possible for seemingly contradictory designs, including conflicting moderation rules, to interoperate. Conversely, our concept of channels prevents interoperation from occurring by accident, avoiding context collapse. Graffiti applications interact through a minimal client-side API, which we show admits at least two decentralized implementations. Above the API, we built a Vue.js plugin, which we use to develop applications similar to Twitter, Messenger, and Wikipedia using only client-side code. Our case studies explore how these and other novel applications interoperate, as well as the broader ecosystem that Graffiti enables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 38th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '25), September 28-October 1, 2025, Busan, Republic of Korea. 21 pages</p></details> |
| **[Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ACM/IEEE MODELS'25</p></details> |

Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over $\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors' performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly noisy distributions.</p></details> |  |

Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

Not only are there many defects such as missing elements in the models created by learners during the exercises, but the layout of elements in the class diagrams often differs significantly from the correct answers created by the instructors. In this paper, we focus on the above problem and propose a method to provide effective support to learners during modeling exercises by automatically converting the layout of the learner's class diagram to that of the instructor, in addition to indicating the correctness of the artifacts to the learners during the exercises. The proposed method was implemented and evaluated as a tool, and the results indicate that the automatic layout conversion was an effective feedback to the learners.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has highlighted the importance of empathy in SE, there is limited understanding of how empathy manifests in SE practice, what motivates SE practitioners to demonstrate empathy, and the factors that influence empathy in SE work. Our study explores these aspects through 22 interviews and a large scale survey with 116 software practitioners. Our findings provide insights into the expression of empathy in SE, the drivers behind empathetic practices, SE activities where empathy is perceived as useful or not, and the other factors that influence empathy. In addition, we offer practical implications for SE practitioners and researchers, offering a deeper understanding of how to effectively integrate empathy into SE processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Versus Static Code Analysis Tools: A Systematic Benchmark for Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04448v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software relies on a multitude of automated testing and quality assurance tools to prevent errors, bugs and potential vulnerabilities. This study sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based static code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three state-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform (GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten real-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories such as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure classical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency, and the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based scanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their static counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs' advantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason across broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial trade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language models mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation artefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static analysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and imprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We therefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in development for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic rule-based scanners for high-assurance verification. The open benchmark and JSON-based result harness released with this paper lay a foundation for reproducible, practitioner-centric research into next-generation automated code security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking New Ground in Software Defect Prediction: Introducing Practical and Actionable Metrics with Superior Predictive Power for Enhanced Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04408v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software defect prediction using code metrics has been extensively researched over the past five decades. However, prediction harnessing non-software metrics is under-researched. Considering that the root cause of software defects is often attributed to human error, human factors theory might offer key forecasting metrics for actionable insights. This paper explores automated software defect prediction at the method level based on the developers' coding habits. First, we propose a framework for deciding the metrics to conduct predictions. Next, we compare the performance of our metrics to that of the code and commit history metrics shown by research to achieve the highest performance to date. Finally, we analyze the prediction importance of each metric. As a result of our analyses of twenty-one critical infrastructure large-scale open-source software projects, we have presented: (1) a human error-based framework with metrics useful for defect prediction at method level; (2) models using our proposed metrics achieve better average prediction performance than the state-of-the-art code metrics and history measures; (3) the prediction importance of all metrics distributes differently with each of the novel metrics having better average importance than code and history metrics; (4) the novel metrics dramatically enhance the explainability, practicality, and actionability of software defect prediction models, significantly advancing the field. We present a systematic approach to forecasting defect-prone software methods via a human error framework. This work empowers practitioners to act on predictions, empirically demonstrating how developer coding habits contribute to defects in software systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 2 formulas, 12 tables</p></details> |

Yet, organizations in regulated industries face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements, creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4) Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations, generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASE'25 Industry Showcase</p></details> |

When vulnerabilities arise, the OSS community may struggle to address them due to inactivity or lack of resources. Research highlights the link between OSS maintenance and financial support. To sustain the OSS ecosystem, maintainers should register on donation platforms and link these profiles on their project pages, enabling financial support from users and industry stakeholders. However, a detailed study on donation platform usage in OSS is missing. This study analyzes the adoption of donation platforms in the PyPI ecosystem. For each PyPI library, we retrieve assigned URLs, dependencies, and, when available, owner type and GitHub donation links. Using PageRank, we analyze different subsets of libraries from both a library and dependency chain perspective. Our findings reveal that donation platform links are often omitted from PyPI project pages and instead listed on GitHub repositories. GitHub Sponsors is the dominant platform, though many PyPI-listed links are outdated, emphasizing the need for automated link verification. Adoption rates vary significantly across libraries and dependency chains: while individual PyPI libraries show low adoption, those used as dependencies have much higher usage. This suggests that many dependencies actively seek financial support, benefiting developers relying on PyPI libraries.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at 29th edition of International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

We present Vanilla-Converter, a command-line tool that facilitates the migration of BPMN models from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8. Vanilla-Converter automates the transformation process, supports a wide range of BPMN elements, and produces a transformed model and a detailed transformation log indicating automatic changes and remaining manual conversion tasks. The tool's effectiveness is demonstrated through three case studies with real industrially used Camunda 7 models, confirming its ability to convert these models into valid and executable Camunda 8 models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12286v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVOC2RUST: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rust's compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical systems, creating demand for translating legacy C codebases to Rust. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the function, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in project-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32% improvements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches, along with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools. At the module level, EvoC2Rust reaches 92.25% compilation and 89.53% test pass rates on industrial projects, even for complex codebases and long functions.</p></details> |  |

Yet, studies investigating the productive prompting techniques often employed a limited problem space, primarily focusing on well-known prompting patterns and mainly targeting function-level SE practices. We identify significant gaps in real-world workflows that involve complexities beyond class-level (e.g., multi-class dependencies) and different features that can impact Human-LLM Interactions (HLIs) processes in code generation. To address these issues, we designed an experiment that comprehensively analyzed the HLI features regarding the code generation productivity. Our study presents two project-level benchmark tasks, extending beyond function-level evaluations. We conducted a user study with 36 participants from diverse backgrounds, asking them to solve the assigned tasks by interacting with the GPT assistant using specific prompting patterns. We also examined the participants' experience and their behavioral features during interactions by analyzing screen recordings and GPT chat logs. Our statistical and empirical investigation revealed (1) that three out of 15 HLI features significantly impacted the productivity in code generation; (2) five primary guidelines for enhancing productivity for HLI processes; and (3) a taxonomy of 29 runtime and logic errors that can occur during HLI processes, along with suggested mitigation plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>The b...</summary><p>The benchmark repository has not been publicly released yet due to the IP policy in our institutions.

While code generation using LLMs has become a popular field of research, code evaluation using LLMs remains under-explored. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We propose multi-agentic novel approaches using \emph{question-specific rubrics} tailored to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical assessment than the existing approaches that use \emph{question-agnostic rubrics}. To address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics (Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that \emph{question-specific rubrics} significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond mere syntactic correctness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICER 2025</p></details> |

The semantic gap between natural language issue descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level localization. The results also show that improved localization performance translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective strategy for improving automated software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Dependency Inference for Industrial Code Generation Based on UML Sequence Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03379v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language (NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</p></details> |  |

Model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have gained traction in addressing these challenges. However, the impact of these strategies on the robustness of compressed language models for code in adversarial scenarios remains poorly understood. Understanding how these compressed models behave under adversarial attacks is essential for their safe and effective deployment in real-world applications. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of how common compression strategies affect the adversarial robustness of compressed models. We assess the robustness of compressed versions of three widely used language models for code across three software analytics tasks, using six evaluation metrics and four commonly used classical adversarial attacks. Our findings indicate that compressed models generally maintain comparable performance to their uncompressed counterparts. However, when subjected to adversarial attacks, compressed models exhibit significantly reduced robustness. These results reveal a trade-off between model size reduction and adversarial robustness, underscoring the need for careful consideration when deploying compressed models in security-critical software applications. Our study highlights the need for further research into compression strategies that strike a balance between computational efficiency and adversarial robustness, which is essential for deploying reliable language models for code in real-world software applications.</p></details> |  |

Current red-teaming tools often rely on fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration, guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods, ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors (Xiangzhe Xu and Guangyu Shen) contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

As these models become integral to development workflows, a systematic comparison of their performance is essential for optimizing their use in real world applications. This study benchmarks these four prominent LLMs on one hundred and fifty LeetCode problems across easy, medium, and hard difficulties, generating solutions in Java and Python. We evaluate each model based on execution time, memory usage, and algorithmic complexity, revealing significant performance differences. ChatGPT demonstrates consistent efficiency in execution time and memory usage, while Copilot and DeepSeek show variability as task complexity increases. Gemini, although effective on simpler tasks, requires more attempts as problem difficulty rises.

Many existing evaluation frameworks address technical aspects such as code correctness and efficiency, but often overlook crucial human factors that affect the successful integration of AI assistants in software development workflows. In this study, I analyzed GitHub Copilot's interaction with users through its chat interface, measured Copilot's ability to adapt explanations and code generation to user expertise levels, and assessed its effectiveness in facilitating collaborative programming experiences. I established a human-centered requirements framework with clear metrics to evaluate these qualities in GitHub Copilot chat.

However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Need to Rethink Trust in AI Assistants for Software Development: A Critical Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12461v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trust is a fundamental concept in human decision-making and collaboration that has long been studied in philosophy and psychology. However, software engineering (SE) articles often use the term trust informally-providing an explicit definition or embedding results in established trust models is rare. In SE research on AI assistants, this practice culminates in equating trust with the likelihood of accepting generated content, which, in isolation, does not capture the full complexity of the trust concept. Without a common definition, true secondary research on trust is impossible. The objectives of our research were: (1) to present the psychological and philosophical foundations of human trust, (2) to systematically study how trust is conceptualized in SE and the related disciplines human-computer interaction and information systems, and (3) to discuss limitations of equating trust with content acceptance, outlining how SE research can adopt existing trust models to overcome the widespread informal use of the term trust. We conducted a literature review across disciplines and a critical review of recent SE articles focusing on conceptualizations of trust. We found that trust is rarely defined or conceptualized in SE articles. Related disciplines commonly embed their methodology and results in established trust models, clearly distinguishing, for example, between initial trust and trust formation and between appropriate and inappropriate trust. On a meta-scientific level, other disciplines further discuss whether and when trust can be applied to AI assistants at all. Our study reveals a significant maturity gap of trust research in SE compared to related disciplines. We provide concrete recommendations on how SE researchers can adopt established trust models and instruments to study trust in AI assistants beyond the acceptance of generated software artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, currently under review</p></details> |

This study investigates whether explanation needs, classified from user reviews, can be predicted based on app properties, enabling early consideration during development and large-scale requirements mining. We analyzed a gold standard dataset of 4,495 app reviews enriched with metadata (e.g., app version, ratings, age restriction, in-app purchases). Correlation analyses identified mostly weak associations between app properties and explanation needs, with moderate correlations only for specific features such as app version, number of reviews, and star ratings. Linear regression models showed limited predictive power, with no reliable forecasts across configurations. Validation on a manually labeled dataset of 495 reviews confirmed these findings. Categories such as Security & Privacy and System Behavior showed slightly higher predictive potential, while Interaction and User Interface remained most difficult to predict. Overall, our results highlight that explanation needs are highly context-dependent and cannot be precisely inferred from app metadata alone. Developers and requirements engineers should therefore supplement metadata analysis with direct user feedback to effectively design explainable and user-centered software systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Workshop (REW 2025)</p></details> |

A Case Study on Stable Diffusion Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09014v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are nowadays widely used to generate graphical content used for multiple purposes, e.g. web, art, advertisement. However, it has been shown that the images generated by these models could reinforce societal biases already existing in specific contexts. In this paper, we focus on understanding if this is the case when one generates images related to various software engineering tasks. In fact, the Software Engineering (SE) community is not immune from gender and ethnicity disparities, which could be amplified by the use of these models. Hence, if used without consciousness, artificially generated images could reinforce these biases in the SE domain. Specifically, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation of the gender and ethnicity bias exposed by three versions of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model (a very popular open-source text-to-image model) - SD 2, SD XL, and SD 3 - towards SE tasks. We obtain 6,720 images by feeding each model with two sets of prompts describing different software-related tasks: one set includes the Software Engineer keyword, and one set does not include any specification of the person performing the task. Next, we evaluate the gender and ethnicity disparities in the generated images. Results show how all models are significantly biased towards male figures when representing software engineers. On the contrary, while SD 2 and SD XL are strongly biased towards White figures, SD 3 is slightly more biased towards Asian figures. Nevertheless, all models significantly under-represent Black and Arab figures, regardless of the prompt style used. The results of our analysis highlight severe concerns about adopting those models to generate content for SE tasks and open the field for future research on bias mitigation in this context.</p></details> |  |

In our previous study, we identified a range of practitioner strategies for fostering empathy in SE contexts. Building on these insights, this paper introduces 17 actionable empathy guidelines designed to support practitioners, teams, and organisations. We also explore how these guidelines can be implemented in practice by examining real-world applications, challenges, and strategies to overcome them shared by software practitioners. To support adoption, we present a visual prioritisation framework that categorises the guidelines based on perceived importance, ease of implementation, and willingness to adopt. The findings offer practical and flexible suggestions for integrating empathy into everyday SE work, helping teams move from principles to sustainable action.</p></details> |  |

At the very least when providing sample solutions is part of automated feedback. But programs can also be used as part of the exercise task description to communicate a task's requirements. Writing good program generators that produce varied yet idiomatic code while being easily adaptable for new tasks is challenging. The challenges are intensified if task generation requires additional artifacts, like a more general behavior specification for testing or additional textual descriptions. Manually writing generators for multiple different but strongly related artifacts gets complicated quickly. We present an approach where instead of writing monolithic generators for multiple connected artifacts one specifies a small set of abstract building blocks and for each such building block defines sets of concrete realizations for various kinds of artifacts. Then the intended structure of the resulting artifacts is specified as a composition of the small abstract building blocks. This abstract description then serves as the common source from which related artifacts can be derived automatically. The approach is generic in the kind of artifacts it can produce and is therefore adaptable to a wide range of contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |

In many cases, this means that it is challenging for them to comprehend the operational semantics of such machines and, as a consequence, determine why a word is accepted or rejected. This is not entirely surprising, because students are mostly trained to design and implement deterministic programs. Comprehension of pushdown automata is further complicated, because reasoning about the stack is necessary. A common difficulty students face, for example, is understanding that two different computations on the same word may reach the same state with different stack values. To aid student understanding, we present two novel dynamic visualization tools for FSM -- a domain-specific programming language for the Automata Theory classroom -- to support the design of such machines. These tools visualize all computations that may be performed, respectively, by a nondeterministic finite-state machine or by a pushdown automata in a stepwise manner. In addition, these tools aid the machine verification process by allowing users to visually validate whether the properties a state represents hold when a machine transitions into it.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |

One of the most widely-used extensions endows Turing machines with multiple tapes. Although multitape Turing machines are an abstraction to simplify Turing machine design, students find them no less challenging. To aid students in understanding these machines, the FSM programming language provides support for their definition and execution. This, however, has proven insufficient for many students to understand the operational semantics of such machines and to understand why such machines accept or reject a word. To address this problem, three visualization tools have been developed. The first is a dynamic visualization tool that simulates machine execution. The second is a static visualization tool that automatically renders a graphic for a multitape Turing machine's transition diagram. The third is a static visualization tool that automatically renders computation graphs for multitape Turing machines. This article presents these tools and illustrates how they are used to help students design and implement multitape Turing machines. In addition, empirical data is presented that suggests these tools are well-received and found useful by students.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings TFPiE 2025, arXiv:2508.02305</p></details> |
| **[ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10323v4)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |
| **[ReFuzzer: Feedback-Driven Approach to Enhance Validity of LLM-Generated Test Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03603v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM-based compiler fuzzers often produce syntactically or semantically invalid test programs, limiting their effectiveness in exercising compiler optimizations and backend components. We introduce ReFuzzer, a framework for refining LLM-generated test programs by systematically detecting and correcting compilation and runtime violations (e.g. division by zero or array out-of-bounds accesses). ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local LLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving fuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of diverse yet valid test programs. We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box fuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs' validity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of 2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing significantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR generation components. For example, vectorization coverage had an absolute improvement of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 7.1% in black-, grey-, and white-box fuzzing, enhancing testing effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[MalFlows: Context-aware Fusion of Heterogeneous Flow Semantics for Android Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03588v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis, a fundamental technique in Android app examination, enables the extraction of control flows, data flows, and inter-component communications (ICCs), all of which are essential for malware detection. However, existing methods struggle to leverage the semantic complementarity across different types of flows for representing program behaviors, and their context-unaware nature further hinders the accuracy of cross-flow semantic integration. We propose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware fusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal is to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related information for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We further propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that distinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual constraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations through the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally fed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively aggregate the strengths of diverse flow-related information for assessing maliciousness within apps. We evaluate MalFlows on a large-scale dataset comprising over 20 million flow instances extracted from more than 31,000 real-world apps. Experimental results demonstrate that MalFlows outperforms representative baselines in Android malware detection, and meanwhile, validate the effectiveness of flow2vec in accurately learning app representations from the HIN constructed over the heterogeneous flows.</p></details> | Submitted to TDSC |

While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in design-to-code tasks, they often fail to accurately preserve the layout during code generation. To this end, we draw inspiration from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in human cognition and propose LaTCoder, a novel approach that enhances layout preservation in webpage design during code generation with Layout-as-Thought (LaT). Specifically, we first introduce a simple yet efficient algorithm to divide the webpage design into image blocks. Next, we prompt MLLMs using a CoTbased approach to generate code for each block. Finally, we apply two assembly strategies-absolute positioning and an MLLM-based method-followed by dynamic selection to determine the optimal output. We evaluate the effectiveness of LaTCoder using multiple backbone MLLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-VL2, Gemini, and GPT-4o) on both a public benchmark and a newly introduced, more challenging benchmark (CC-HARD) that features complex layouts. The experimental results on automatic metrics demonstrate significant improvements. Specifically, TreeBLEU scores increased by 66.67% and MAE decreased by 38% when using DeepSeek-VL2, compared to direct prompting. Moreover, the human preference evaluation results indicate that annotators favor the webpages generated by LaTCoder in over 60% of cases, providing strong evidence of the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | KDD 2025 v2 |
| **[Training Long-Context, Multi-Turn Software Engineering Agents with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03501v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE), which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that responds to each action with a non-trivial observation. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to 39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based on open models.</p></details> |  |

In fact, we investigate the design and evaluation of an AI-powered educational tool designed to enhance Arabic language learning for non-native speakers with beginner-to-intermediate proficiency level. The tool leverages advanced AI models to generate interactive visual quizzes, deploying Visual Question Answering as the primary activity. Adopting a constructivist learning approach, the system encourages active learning through real-life visual quizzes, and image-based questions that focus on improving vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension. The system integrates Vision-Language Pretraining models to generate contextually relevant image description from which Large Language Model generate assignments based on customized Arabic language Learning quizzes thanks to prompting. The effectiveness of the tool is evaluated through a manual annotated benchmark consisting of 1266 real-life visual quizzes, with human participants providing feedback. The results show a suitable accuracy rates, validating the tool's potential to bridge the gap in Arabic language education and highlighting the tool's promise as a reliable, AI-powered resource for Arabic learners, offering personalized and interactive learning experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[BitsAI-Fix: LLM-Driven Approach for Automated Lint Error Resolution in Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03487v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency. This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers, resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85% remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in large-scale industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Evaluation of Large Language Models in Multilingual Vulnerability Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03470v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various Deep Learning-based approaches with pre-trained language models have been proposed for automatically repairing software vulnerabilities. However, these approaches are limited to a specific programming language (C/C++). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities and strong semantic understanding, exhibiting potential to overcome multilingual vulnerability limitations. Although some work has begun to explore LLMs' repair performance, their effectiveness is unsatisfactory. To address these limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate the performance of automated vulnerability repair approaches and state-of-the-art LLMs across seven programming languages. Results show GPT-4o, instruction-tuned with few-shot prompting, performs competitively against the leading approach, VulMaster. Additionally, the LLM-based approach shows superior performance in repairing unique vulnerabilities and is more likely to repair the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Instruction-tuned GPT-4o demonstrates strong generalization on vulnerabilities in previously unseen language, outperforming existing approaches. Analysis shows Go consistently achieves the highest effectiveness across all model types, while C/C++ performs the worst. Based on findings, we discuss the promise of LLM on multilingual vulnerability repair and the reasons behind LLM's failed cases. This work takes the first look at repair approaches and LLMs across multiple languages, highlighting the promising future of adopting LLMs for multilingual vulnerability repair.</p></details> |  |

Since such code clones, i.e., identical or similar fragments of code, can bloat software projects and cause issues like bug or vulnerability propagation, their identification is of importance. In this paper, we present the StoneDetector platform and its underlying method for finding code clones in Java source and Bytecode. StoneDetector implements a conventional clone detection approach based upon the textual comparison of paths derived from the code's representation by dominator trees. In this way, the tool does not only find exact and syntactically similar near-miss code clones, but also code clones that are harder to detect due to their larger variety in the syntax. We demonstrate StoneDetector's versatility as a conventional clone detection platform and analyze its various available configuration parameters, including the usage of different string metrics, hashing algorithms, etc. In our exhaustive evaluation with other conventional clone detectors on several state-of-the-art benchmarks, we can show StoneDetector's performance and scalability in finding code clones in both, Java source and Bytecode.</p></details> | <details><summary>suppl...</summary><p>supplementary information available at https://stonedetector.fmi.uni-jena.de/</p></details> |

However, these users often face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e., the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in UIST 2025</p></details> |

While such systems promise increased autonomy, scalability, and intelligent decision-making across distributed environments, their adoption raises concerns regarding technical immaturity, integration complexity, organizational readiness, and performance-cost trade-offs. In this study, we conducted a preliminary thematic mapping to identify factors influencing the adoption of agentic software within the context of 6G. Drawing on a multivocal literature review and targeted scanning, we identified 29 motivators and 27 demotivators, which were further categorized into five high-level themes in each group. This thematic mapping offers a structured overview of the enabling and inhibiting forces shaping organizational readiness for agentic transformation. Positioned as a feasibility assessment, the study represents an early phase of a broader research initiative aimed at developing and validating a layered maturity model grounded in CMMI model with the software architectural three dimensions possibly Data, Business Logic, and Presentation. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide a practical framework to help software-driven organizations assess, structure, and advance their agent-first capabilities in alignment with the demands of 6G.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures and FIT'25 Conference</p></details> |

Despite its acknowledged significance, research on PS within the field of software engineering remains limited. The socio-technical complexities and fast-paced nature of software development present challenges to cultivating PS. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic secondary study has synthesized existing knowledge on PS in the context of software engineering. Objective: This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the existing body of knowledge on PS in software engineering. Specifically, it seeks to identify the potential antecedents and consequences associated with the presence or absence of PS among individuals involved in the software development process. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted, encompassing studies retrieved from four digital libraries. The extracted data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results: The findings indicate a growing academic interest in PS within software engineering, with the majority of studies grounded in Edmondson's framework. Factors antecedents of PS were identified at the individual, team, and organizational levels, including team autonomy, agile methodologies, and leadership behaviors. Conclusion: PS fosters innovation, learning, and team performance within software development. However, significant gaps persist in understanding the contextual factors influencing PS, its underlying mechanisms, and effective strategies for its enhancement. Future research should address these gaps by investigating the practical applications of PS within diverse organizational settings in the software engineering domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Key-Augmented Neural Triggers for Knowledge Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03340v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code comprehension and knowledge sharing remain core challenges in software engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise by generating explanations of program structure and logic. However, these approaches still face limitations: First, relevant knowledge is distributed across multiple files within a repository, aka semantic fragmentation. Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade performance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm attention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often outdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented Neural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into both training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access to repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding inference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data directly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context, reducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise deployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the synthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions; compare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference speed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability. Results show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking needs. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack expert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to 85% across all models. Overall, it is well-suited for scalable, low-latency, on-premise deployments, providing a strong foundation for code comprehension.</p></details> |  |

Their application to quantum software development remains limited, in part because of the lack of high-quality datasets both for LLM training and as dependable knowledge sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce PennyLang, an off-the-shelf, high-quality dataset of 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples with contextual descriptions, curated from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the creation and open-source release of PennyLang, a purpose-built dataset for quantum programming with PennyLane; (2) a framework for automated quantum code dataset construction that systematizes curation, annotation, and formatting to maximize downstream LLM usability; and (3) a baseline evaluation of the dataset across multiple open-source models, including ablation studies, all conducted within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Using PennyLang with RAG substantially improves performance: for example, Qwen 7B's success rate rises from 8.7% without retrieval to 41.7% with full-context augmentation, and LLaMa 4 improves from 78.8% to 84.8%, while also reducing hallucinations and enhancing quantum code correctness. Moving beyond Qiskit-focused studies, we bring LLM-based tools and reproducible methods to PennyLane for advancing AI-assisted quantum development.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

GUI prototypes play a critical role in requirements elicitation by enabling stakeholders to visualize, assess, and refine system concepts collaboratively. Moreover, prototypes serve as effective tools for early testing, iterative evaluation, and validation of design ideas with both end users and development teams. Despite these advantages, the process of constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming, frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise. Recent research has sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches, which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models for specific GUI repositories. However, these methods often suffer from limited retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets. In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based reranking techniques. GUI-ReRank further introduces a fully customizable GUI repository annotation and embedding pipeline, enabling users to effortlessly make their own GUI repositories searchable, which allows for rapid discovery of relevant GUIs for inspiration or seamless integration into customized LLM-based RAG workflows. We evaluated our approach on an established NL-based GUI retrieval benchmark, demonstrating that GUI-ReRank significantly outperforms SOTA tailored LTR models in both retrieval accuracy and generalizability. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive cost and efficiency analysis of employing MLLMs for reranking, providing valuable insights regarding the trade-offs between retrieval effectiveness and computational resources.

| **[SmartLLMs Scheduler: A Framework for Cost-Effective LLMs Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03258v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time reduction of 63.28%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A System Model Generation Benchmark from Natural Language Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03215v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System models, a critical artifact in software development, provide a formal abstraction of both the structural and behavioral aspects of software systems, which can facilitate the early requirements analysis and architecture design. However, developing system models remains challenging due to the specific syntax of model description languages and the relative scarcity of public model examples. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating code with programming languages and could potentially aid in system model development, no benchmarks currently exist for evaluating their ability to generate system models with specific description languages. We present SysMBench, which comprises 151 human-curated scenarios spanning a wide range of popular domains and varying difficulty levels. Each scenario mainly comprises a natural language requirements description, a system model expressed in a specific model description language, and a visualized system model diagram. The requirements description is fed as user input to the LLM, the system model with description language is used to verify if the generated system model conforms to the requirements, and the visualized diagram serves to support manual validation. We introduce SysMEval, a semantic-aware evaluation metric to evaluate the quality of generated system models. We evaluate 17 popular LLMs on this task with three traditional metrics and SysMEval, from directly prompting to three commonly used enhancement strategies. Our in-depth evaluation shows that LLMs perform poorly on SysMBench, with the highest BLEU of 4% and SysMEval-F1 of 62%. We release the SysMBench and its evaluation framework to enable future research on LLM-based system model generation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[MRG-Bench: Evaluating and Exploring the Requirements of Context for Repository-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02998v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation. However, current evaluation datasets suffer from issues such as the lack of runnable test cases, deviation from the distribution of real-world code, and the ability to evaluate only the Python language. These limitations undermine the credibility of the evaluation results. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MRG-Bench} (Multi-language Repository-level Code Generation Benchmark), a novel dataset that provides a more accurate evaluation of LLMs in practical repository-level code generation tasks. MRG-Bench has three main features: (1) practical data sourced from real-world code repositories that align to the practical distribution, (2) multiple programming languages support, including Python, Java, and Go, and (3) project-level runnable test cases to assess the quality of the generated code. Based on MRG-Bench, we conducted extensive experiments including large language models, long-context models, and RAG-related methods. These evaluation results demonstrate that \textbf{current repository-level code generation techniques suffer from significant performance deficiencies}. To further investigate why models fail, we designed novel experiments to annotate the underlying causes of generation errors. The results explicitly show that the majority of methods suffer from "\textbf{difficulty in understanding user requirements}," failing to comprehend their assigned tasks accurately. Moreover, the impact of different repository-level contexts on this issue exhibits significant disparities across different programming languages, suggesting that, in practice, specialized contextual information needs to be designed for different languages.</p></details> |  |

Software practitioners can address this by delivering digital services that enhance seniors' independence and reduce reliance on routine support from family members and healthcare infrastructure. However, traditional development practices, constrained by time and resources, often result in applications with major accessibility and personalisation barriers. Increasing pressure from regulatory requirements, such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA), and the personal empathy many developers feel toward supporting their older loved ones and their own future selves have created a demand for tools that support the development of accessible and adaptive software. To address this demand, this paper presents an interview-based empirical study with 18 software practitioners, evaluating AdaptForge: a low-code model-driven engineering (MDE) tool that enables the efficient creation of accessible and adaptive applications for senior users by mitigating development constraints through automated code generation. Based on these insights, we identify developer expectations for adopting such tools as industry-standard solutions and provide empirically grounded recommendations for designing low-code tools that support accessible and adaptive software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

While many methods detect test smells, few support automated removal, and most rely on static analysis or machine learning. This study evaluates models with relatively small parameter counts - Llama-3.2-3B, Gemma-2-9B, DeepSeek-R1-14B, and Phi-4-14B - for their ability to detect and refactor test smells using agent-based workflows. We assess workflows with one, two, and four agents over 150 instances of 5 common smells from real-world Java projects. Our approach generalizes to Python, Golang, and JavaScript. All models detected nearly all instances, with Phi-4-14B achieving the best refactoring accuracy (pass@5 of 75.3%). Phi-4-14B with four-agents performed within 5% of proprietary LLMs (single-agent). Multi-agent setups outperformed single-agent ones in three of five smell types, though for Assertion Roulette, one agent sufficed. We submitted pull requests with Phi-4-14B-generated code to open-source projects and six were merged.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Validation of LLM-based Evaluators for Software Engineering Artifacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02827v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However, establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality. We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation), an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with expected ordering. A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps. While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks. These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams to support model release decisions.</p></details> |  |

Static analysis (SA) tools produce many diagnostic alerts indicating that source code in C or C++ may be defective and potentially vulnerable to security exploits. Many of these alerts are false positives. Identifying the true-positive alerts and repairing the defects in the associated code are huge efforts that automated program repair (APR) tools can help with. Our experience showed us that APR can reduce the number of SA alerts significantly and reduce the manual effort of analysts to review code. This engineering experience paper details the application of design, development, and performance testing to an APR tool we built that repairs C/C++ code associated with 3 categories of alerts produced by multiple SA tools. Its repairs are simple and local. Furthermore, our findings convinced the maintainers of the CERT Coding Standards to re-assess and update the metrics used to assess when violations of guidelines are detectable or repairable. We discuss engineering design choices made to support goals of trustworthiness and acceptability to developers. Our APR tool repaired 8718 out of 9234 alerts produced by one SA tool on one codebase. It can repair 3 flaw categories. For 2 flaw categories, 2 SA tools, and 2 codebases, our tool repaired or dismissed as false positives over 80% of alerts, on average. Tests showed repairs did not appreciably degrade the performance of the code or cause new alerts to appear (with the possible exception of sqlite3.c). This paper describes unique contributions that include a new empirical analysis of SA data, our selection method for flaw categories to repair, publication of our APR tool, and a dataset of SA alerts from open-source SA tools run on open-source codebases. It discusses positive and negative results and lessons learned.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-RAG on Large Codebases Using Code Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02611v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation. We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores 84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Identification of Machine Learning-Specific Code Smells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02541v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria. This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer environment.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in software engineering tasks and translations across domains. However, little is known about LLM capabilities in translating open-source technical documentation, which mixes natural language, code, URLs, and markdown formatting. To understand the need and potential for LLMs in technical documentation translation, we evaluated community translation activity and English-to-German translations of 50 README files using OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 and Anthropic's Claude. We found scarce translation activity, mostly in larger repositories and community-driven in nature. LLM performance comparison suggests they can provide accurate translations. However, analysis revealed fidelity challenges: both models struggled to preserve structural components (e.g., hyperlinks) and exhibited formatting inconsistencies. These findings highlight both promise and challenges of LLM-assisted documentation internationalization. As a first step toward translation-aware continuous integration pipelines, we introduce TRIFID, an early-stage translation fidelity scoring framework that automatically checks how well translations preserve code, links, and formatting. Our efforts provide a foundation for automated LLM-driven support for creating and maintaining open source documentation.</p></details> |  |

As organizations increasingly depend on OSS, understanding project evolution is critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one dimension remains understudied: project resilience -- the ability to return to normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures, security vulnerabilities, and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit patterns reflect underlying project characteristics such as mature governance, sustained contributors, and robust development processes that enable resilience. Building on the Composite Stability Index (CSI) framework, we empirically validate commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked repositories. Our findings reveal that only 2\% of repositories exhibit daily stability, 29\% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly stability, while half remain unstable across all temporal levels. Programming languages and blockchain applications were the most stable. We identified two exemplary repositories that achieved stability at all three granularities, whose governance models, CI cadence, and release policies could serve as reference frameworks. We observed that large yearly commit throughput does not necessarily correlate with stability. Beyond commits, stability can be enriched with issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community-engagement metrics to broaden resilience assessment and sharpen stability-based risk evaluation.</p></details> |  |

The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We make available our benchmark and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench and project homepage at https://xyzcs.github.io/scireplicate.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).</p></details> | <details><summary>*Firs...</summary><p>*First three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |

Although already studied in Business Process Management (BPM), sustainability research has primarily focused on environmental concerns. However, achieving a holistic and lasting impact requires a systematic approach to address sustainability beyond the environmental dimension. This work proposes a conceptual model and a structured methodology with the goal of analyzing the potential of IoT to measure and improve the sustainability of BPs. The conceptual model formally represents key sustainability concepts, linking BPM and IoT by highlighting how IoT devices support and contribute to sustainability. The methodology guides the systematic analysis of existing BPs, identifies opportunities, and implements sustainability-aware, IoT-enhanced BPs. The approach is illustrated through a running example from the tourism domain and a case study in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information Systems Frontiers (1572-9419)</p></details> |

EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93% functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing .NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96% semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90% compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under measurable control.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 tables, 1 algorithm.

| **[STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench: Evaluating Complex Multi-Function Comprehension and Fine-Grained Execution Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05193v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code intelligence, yet systematically evaluating their code understanding and reasoning abilities remains challenging. Mainstream benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores, limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g., chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including 14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis, symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

LadyBug connects to an Android app's GitHub repository, and is triggered when a bug is reported in the corresponding issue tracker. Developers can then record a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the project that most likely contain the reported bug. We empirically evaluated LadyBug using an automated testing pipeline and benchmark called RedWing that contains 80 fully-localized and reproducible bug reports from 39 Android apps. Our results illustrate that LadyBug outperforms text-retrieval-based baselines and that the utilization of UI information leads to a substantial increase in localization accuracy.

| **[An ML-based Approach to Predicting Software Change Dependencies: Insights from an Empirical Study on OpenStack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05034v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it. Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment. They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes, while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33% and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k precision has room for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Bug Frame Retrieval from Gameplay Videos Using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04895v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern game studios deliver new builds and patches at a rapid pace, generating thousands of bug reports, many of which embed gameplay videos. To verify and triage these bug reports, developers must watch the submitted videos. This manual review is labour-intensive, slow, and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a single frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers instant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug. Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video to a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug moments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a vision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match the textual bug description and selects the most representative frame. We evaluated this approach using real-world developer-submitted gameplay videos and JIRA bug reports from a popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. The pipeline achieves an overall F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the top-1 retrieved frame. Performance is highest for the Lighting & Shadow (F1 = 0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories, and lowest for Animation & VFX (0.51). By replacing video viewing with an immediately informative image, our approach dramatically reduces manual effort and speeds up triage and regression checks, offering practical benefits to quality assurance (QA) teams and developers across the game industry.</p></details> |  |

Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ACM/IEEE MODELS'25</p></details> |

Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

In the context of research data, these models are typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data integration for non-experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Tools and Demonstrations Track of ACM/IEEE MODELS'25</p></details> |

We propose R2Vul, a method that combines reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) and structured reasoning distillation to teach small code LLMs to detect vulnerabilities while generating security-aware explanations. Unlike prior chain-of-thought and instruction tuning approaches, R2Vul rewards well-founded over deceptively plausible vulnerability explanations through RLAIF, which results in more precise detection and high-quality reasoning generation. To support RLAIF, we construct the first multilingual preference dataset for vulnerability detection, comprising 18,000 high-quality samples in C\#, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C. We evaluate R2Vul across five programming languages and against four static analysis tools, eight state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines, and various fine-tuning approaches. Our results demonstrate that a 1.5B R2Vul model exceeds the performance of its 32B teacher model and leading commercial LLMs such as Claude-4-Opus. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight calibration step that reduces false positive rates under varying imbalanced data distributions. Finally, through qualitative analysis, we show that both LLM and human evaluators consistently rank R2Vul model's reasoning higher than other reasoning-based baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although already studied in Business Process Management (BPM), sustainability research has primarily focused on environmental concerns. However, achieving a holistic and lasting impact requires a systematic approach to address sustainability beyond the environmental dimension. This work proposes a conceptual model and a structured methodology with the goal of analyzing the potential of IoT to measure and improve the sustainability of BPs. The conceptual model formally represents key sustainability concepts, linking BPM and IoT by highlighting how IoT devices support and contribute to sustainability. The methodology guides the systematic analysis of existing BPs, identifies opportunities, and implements sustainability-aware, IoT-enhanced BPs. The approach is illustrated through a running example from the tourism domain and a case study in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information Systems Frontiers (1572-9419)</p></details> |

While these aspects are usually studied in depth separately, it is also important to carry out broader large-scale studies that touch on many topics, because they allow us to put different results into each other's perspective. Past large-scale surveys have provided valuable insights, however, the emergence of new trends (e.g., AI), new learning formats (e.g., in-IDE learning), and the increasing learner diversity highlight the need for an updated comprehensive study. To address this, we conducted a survey with 18,032 learners from 173 countries, ensuring diverse representation and exploring a wide range of topics - formal education, learning formats, AI usage, challenges, motivation, and more. This paper introduces the results of this survey as an open dataset, describes our methodology and the survey questions, and highlights, as a motivating example, three possible research directions within this data: challenges in learning, emerging formats, and insights into the in-IDE format.

EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93% functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing .NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96% semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90% compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under measurable control.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 tables, 1 algorithm.

| **[STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench: Evaluating Complex Multi-Function Comprehension and Fine-Grained Execution Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05193v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code intelligence, yet systematically evaluating their code understanding and reasoning abilities remains challenging. Mainstream benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores, limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g., chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including 14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis, symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.</p></details> |  |

In the context of research data, these models are typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data integration for non-experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Tools and Demonstrations Track of ACM/IEEE MODELS'25</p></details> |
| **[Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo.

While these hardware-based solutions offer strong protection in isolated environments, their effectiveness is being undermined by cloud-native threats such as misconfigurations, compromised APIs, and lateral privilege escalations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of publicly disclosed attacks and breaches involving HSMs and TPMs in cloud environments, identifying recurring architectural and operational flaws. We propose a taxonomy of attack vectors based on real-world case studies and threat intelligence reports, highlighting the gaps between hardware trust anchors and dynamic cloud ecosystems. Furthermore, we evaluate emerging defensive paradigms: confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management systems (dKMS), assessing their potential to address these gaps. Our findings emphasize that securing cloud-based cryptographic trust requires a layered, context-aware approach that integrates both hardware and software safeguards. The study serves as a practical framework for cloud architects and security engineers to reassess key protection strategies in light of evolving threats. To our knowledge, this is the first work to synthesize documented, real-world cloud HSM and TPM failures into a coherent taxonomy grounded in modern threat models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 Flowcharts, 2 Tables</p></details> |

LadyBug connects to an Android app's GitHub repository, and is triggered when a bug is reported in the corresponding issue tracker. Developers can then record a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the project that most likely contain the reported bug. We empirically evaluated LadyBug using an automated testing pipeline and benchmark called RedWing that contains 80 fully-localized and reproducible bug reports from 39 Android apps. Our results illustrate that LadyBug outperforms text-retrieval-based baselines and that the utilization of UI information leads to a substantial increase in localization accuracy.

| **[An ML-based Approach to Predicting Software Change Dependencies: Insights from an Empirical Study on OpenStack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05034v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it. Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment. They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes, while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33% and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k precision has room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

This new model pairs up one Junior PC member with two regular PC members as part of the core review team of a given paper, instead of adding them as an extra reviewer. This paper presents the rationale, implementation, and reflections on the model, including empirical insights from a post-review author survey evaluating the quality and usefulness of reviews.

However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96 projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.</p></details> |  |

Without clear frameworks, communities risk being overwhelmed by the complexity and ambiguity introduced by GenAI, threatening the collaborative ethos that underpins OSS. We conduct a scenario-driven, conceptual exploration using a socio-technical framework inspired by McLuhan's Tetrad to surface both risks and opportunities for community resilience amid GenAI-driven disruption of OSS development across four domains: software practices, documentation, community engagement, and governance. By adopting this lens, OSS leaders and researchers can proactively shape the future of their ecosystems, rather than simply reacting to technological upheaval.</p></details> | 13 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Automated Bug Frame Retrieval from Gameplay Videos Using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04895v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern game studios deliver new builds and patches at a rapid pace, generating thousands of bug reports, many of which embed gameplay videos. To verify and triage these bug reports, developers must watch the submitted videos. This manual review is labour-intensive, slow, and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a single frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers instant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug. Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video to a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug moments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a vision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match the textual bug description and selects the most representative frame. We evaluated this approach using real-world developer-submitted gameplay videos and JIRA bug reports from a popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. The pipeline achieves an overall F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the top-1 retrieved frame. Performance is highest for the Lighting & Shadow (F1 = 0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories, and lowest for Animation & VFX (0.51). By replacing video viewing with an immediately informative image, our approach dramatically reduces manual effort and speeds up triage and regression checks, offering practical benefits to quality assurance (QA) teams and developers across the game industry.</p></details> |  |

We present Graffiti, a system that can be used to build a wide variety of personalized social applications with relative ease that also interoperate with each other. People can freely move between a plurality of designs -- each with its own aesthetic, feature set, and moderation -- all without losing their friends or data. Our concept of total reification makes it possible for seemingly contradictory designs, including conflicting moderation rules, to interoperate. Conversely, our concept of channels prevents interoperation from occurring by accident, avoiding context collapse. Graffiti applications interact through a minimal client-side API, which we show admits at least two decentralized implementations. Above the API, we built a Vue.js plugin, which we use to develop applications similar to Twitter, Messenger, and Wikipedia using only client-side code. Our case studies explore how these and other novel applications interoperate, as well as the broader ecosystem that Graffiti enables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 38th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '25), September 28-October 1, 2025, Busan, Republic of Korea. 21 pages</p></details> |
| **[Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ACM/IEEE MODELS'25</p></details> |

Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over $\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors' performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly noisy distributions.</p></details> |  |

Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

Not only are there many defects such as missing elements in the models created by learners during the exercises, but the layout of elements in the class diagrams often differs significantly from the correct answers created by the instructors. In this paper, we focus on the above problem and propose a method to provide effective support to learners during modeling exercises by automatically converting the layout of the learner's class diagram to that of the instructor, in addition to indicating the correctness of the artifacts to the learners during the exercises. The proposed method was implemented and evaluated as a tool, and the results indicate that the automatic layout conversion was an effective feedback to the learners.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has highlighted the importance of empathy in SE, there is limited understanding of how empathy manifests in SE practice, what motivates SE practitioners to demonstrate empathy, and the factors that influence empathy in SE work. Our study explores these aspects through 22 interviews and a large scale survey with 116 software practitioners. Our findings provide insights into the expression of empathy in SE, the drivers behind empathetic practices, SE activities where empathy is perceived as useful or not, and the other factors that influence empathy. In addition, we offer practical implications for SE practitioners and researchers, offering a deeper understanding of how to effectively integrate empathy into SE processes.</p></details> |  |

This study sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based static code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three state-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform (GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten real-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories such as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure classical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency, and the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based scanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their static counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs' advantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason across broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial trade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language models mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation artefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static analysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and imprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We therefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in development for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic rule-based scanners for high-assurance verification. The open benchmark and JSON-based result harness released with this paper lay a foundation for reproducible, practitioner-centric research into next-generation automated code security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking New Ground in Software Defect Prediction: Introducing Practical and Actionable Metrics with Superior Predictive Power for Enhanced Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04408v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software defect prediction using code metrics has been extensively researched over the past five decades. However, prediction harnessing non-software metrics is under-researched. Considering that the root cause of software defects is often attributed to human error, human factors theory might offer key forecasting metrics for actionable insights. This paper explores automated software defect prediction at the method level based on the developers' coding habits. First, we propose a framework for deciding the metrics to conduct predictions. Next, we compare the performance of our metrics to that of the code and commit history metrics shown by research to achieve the highest performance to date. Finally, we analyze the prediction importance of each metric. As a result of our analyses of twenty-one critical infrastructure large-scale open-source software projects, we have presented: (1) a human error-based framework with metrics useful for defect prediction at method level; (2) models using our proposed metrics achieve better average prediction performance than the state-of-the-art code metrics and history measures; (3) the prediction importance of all metrics distributes differently with each of the novel metrics having better average importance than code and history metrics; (4) the novel metrics dramatically enhance the explainability, practicality, and actionability of software defect prediction models, significantly advancing the field. We present a systematic approach to forecasting defect-prone software methods via a human error framework. This work empowers practitioners to act on predictions, empirically demonstrating how developer coding habits contribute to defects in software systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 2 formulas, 12 tables</p></details> |

Yet, organizations in regulated industries face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements, creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4) Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations, generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASE'25 Industry Showcase</p></details> |

When vulnerabilities arise, the OSS community may struggle to address them due to inactivity or lack of resources. Research highlights the link between OSS maintenance and financial support. To sustain the OSS ecosystem, maintainers should register on donation platforms and link these profiles on their project pages, enabling financial support from users and industry stakeholders. However, a detailed study on donation platform usage in OSS is missing. This study analyzes the adoption of donation platforms in the PyPI ecosystem. For each PyPI library, we retrieve assigned URLs, dependencies, and, when available, owner type and GitHub donation links. Using PageRank, we analyze different subsets of libraries from both a library and dependency chain perspective. Our findings reveal that donation platform links are often omitted from PyPI project pages and instead listed on GitHub repositories. GitHub Sponsors is the dominant platform, though many PyPI-listed links are outdated, emphasizing the need for automated link verification. Adoption rates vary significantly across libraries and dependency chains: while individual PyPI libraries show low adoption, those used as dependencies have much higher usage. This suggests that many dependencies actively seek financial support, benefiting developers relying on PyPI libraries.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at 29th edition of International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

| **[The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12286v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We make available our benchmark and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench and project homepage at https://xyzcs.github.io/scireplicate.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).</p></details> | <details><summary>*Firs...</summary><p>*First three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |

EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93% functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing .NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96% semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90% compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under measurable control.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 tables, 1 algorithm.

Mainstream benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores, limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g., chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including 14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis, symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-assisted JSON Schema Creation and Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05192v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models at the core of system and data engineering processes. In the context of research data, these models are typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data integration for non-experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Tools and Demonstrations Track of ACM/IEEE MODELS'25</p></details> |
| **[Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Code LLMs with Reinforcement Learning in Code Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20367v5)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid evolution of large language models (LLM), reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for code generation and optimization in various domains. This paper presents a systematic survey of the application of RL in code optimization and generation, highlighting its role in enhancing compiler optimization, resource allocation, and the development of frameworks and tools. Subsequent sections first delve into the intricate processes of compiler optimization, where RL algorithms are leveraged to improve efficiency and resource utilization. The discussion then progresses to the function of RL in resource allocation, emphasizing register allocation and system optimization. We also explore the burgeoning role of frameworks and tools in code generation, examining how RL can be integrated to bolster their capabilities. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in harnessing the power of RL to advance code generation and optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[An ML-based Approach to Predicting Software Change Dependencies: Insights from an Empirical Study on OpenStack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05034v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it. Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment. They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes, while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33% and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k precision has room for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI for Object-Oriented Programming: Writing the Right Code and Reasoning the Right Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05005v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We find ourselves in the midst of an explosion in artificial intelligence research, particularly with large language models (LLMs). These models have diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine, and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately enhancing the programming experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[R2Vul: Learning to Reason about Software Vulnerabilities with Reinforcement Learning and Structured Reasoning Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04699v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in software vulnerability detection, yet their reasoning capabilities remain unreliable. We propose R2Vul, a method that combines reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) and structured reasoning distillation to teach small code LLMs to detect vulnerabilities while generating security-aware explanations. Unlike prior chain-of-thought and instruction tuning approaches, R2Vul rewards well-founded over deceptively plausible vulnerability explanations through RLAIF, which results in more precise detection and high-quality reasoning generation. To support RLAIF, we construct the first multilingual preference dataset for vulnerability detection, comprising 18,000 high-quality samples in C\#, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C. We evaluate R2Vul across five programming languages and against four static analysis tools, eight state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines, and various fine-tuning approaches. Our results demonstrate that a 1.5B R2Vul model exceeds the performance of its 32B teacher model and leading commercial LLMs such as Claude-4-Opus. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight calibration step that reduces false positive rates under varying imbalanced data distributions. Finally, through qualitative analysis, we show that both LLM and human evaluators consistently rank R2Vul model's reasoning higher than other reasoning-based baselines.</p></details> |  |

We present Graffiti, a system that can be used to build a wide variety of personalized social applications with relative ease that also interoperate with each other. People can freely move between a plurality of designs -- each with its own aesthetic, feature set, and moderation -- all without losing their friends or data. Our concept of total reification makes it possible for seemingly contradictory designs, including conflicting moderation rules, to interoperate. Conversely, our concept of channels prevents interoperation from occurring by accident, avoiding context collapse. Graffiti applications interact through a minimal client-side API, which we show admits at least two decentralized implementations. Above the API, we built a Vue.js plugin, which we use to develop applications similar to Twitter, Messenger, and Wikipedia using only client-side code. Our case studies explore how these and other novel applications interoperate, as well as the broader ecosystem that Graffiti enables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 38th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '25), September 28-October 1, 2025, Busan, Republic of Korea. 21 pages</p></details> |
| **[$\texttt{Droid}$: A Resource Suite for AI-Generated Code Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10583v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we compile $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidCollection}$}$, the most extensive open data suite for training and evaluating machine-generated code detectors, comprising over a million code samples, seven programming languages, outputs from 43 coding models, and over three real-world coding domains. Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over $\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors' performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly noisy distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated File-Level Logging Generation for Machine Learning Applications using LLMs: A Case Study using GPT-4o Mini](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04820v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We make available our benchmark and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench and project homepage at https://xyzcs.github.io/scireplicate.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPICE: An Automated SWE-Bench Labeling Pipeline for Issue Clarity, Test Coverage, and Effort Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09108v4)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality labeled datasets are crucial for training and evaluating foundation models in software engineering, but creating them is often prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).</p></details> | <details><summary>*Firs...</summary><p>*First three authors contributed equally</p></details> |
