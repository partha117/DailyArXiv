| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Cure: LLM-based Competitor User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15724v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Non-Code Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10833v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code understanding and generation; however, their effectiveness on non-code Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Pre-trained Large Language Models for Repairing Declarative Formal Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11050v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention as a practical research domain focused on automatically fixing bugs in programs. While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

| **[Not One to Rule Them All: Mining Meaningful Code Review Orders From GitHub](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10654v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers use tools such as GitHub pull requests to review code, discuss proposed changes, and request modifications. While changed files are commonly presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100 popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for 44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order. Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests, where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than following a single predefined order.</p></details> |  |

| **[MultiCoSim: A Python-based Multi-Fidelity Co-Simulation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10869v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation is a foundational tool for the analysis and testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS), underpinning activities such as algorithm development, runtime monitoring, and system verification. As CPS grow in complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software, and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for automated and comparative evaluation. Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly compose systems or integrate components across platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed, component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and development.</p></details> |  |

| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Repeton: Structured Bug Repair with ReAct-Guided Patch-and-Test Cycles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08173v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and limited interpretability. We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Hessian-Based Insights Support Fault Diagnosis in Attention-based Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07871v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity, diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis) and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Execution-Aware Program Reduction for WebAssembly via Record and Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07834v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) programs may trigger bugs in their engine implementations. To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRepair: An Exploratory Study on Merging Task-Specific Adapters in Code LLMs for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09568v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown high capabilities in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing the Evolution and Maintenance of Quantum Software Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06894v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, but quantum software development faces significant challenges, including a steep learning curve, high hardware error rates, and a lack of mature engineering practices. This study conducts a large-scale mining analysis of over 21,000 GitHub repositories, containing 1.2 million commits from more than 10,000 developers, to examine the evolution and maintenance of quantum software. We analyze repository growth, programming language and framework adoption, and contributor trends, revealing a 200% increase in repositories and a 150% rise in contributors since 2017. Additionally, we investigate software development and maintenance practices, showing that perfective commits dominate (51.76%), while the low occurrence of corrective commits (18.54%) indicates potential gaps in bug resolution.

| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Identify Flakiness in C++ Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12340v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of regression testing in software testing is crucial as it ensures that any new modifications do not disrupt the existing functionality and behaviour of the software system. The desired outcome is for regression tests to yield identical results without any modifications made to the system being tested. In practice, however, the presence of Flaky Tests introduces non-deterministic behaviour and undermines the reliability of regression testing results. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for identifying the root cause of flaky tests in C++ projects at the code level, with the intention of assisting developers in debugging and resolving them more efficiently. We compile a comprehensive collection of C++ project flaky tests sourced from GitHub repositories. We fine-tune Mistral-7b, Llama2-7b and CodeLlama-7b models on the C++ dataset and an existing Java dataset and evaluate the performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We assess the performance of the models across various datasets and offer recommendations for both research and industry applications. The results indicate that our models exhibit varying performance on the C++ dataset, while their performance is comparable to that of the Java dataset. The Mistral-7b surpasses the other two models regarding all metrics, achieving a score of 1. Our results demonstrate the exceptional capability of LLMs to accurately classify flakiness in C++ and Java projects, providing a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of debugging flaky tests in practice.</p></details> |  |

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM-Based Fault Localization with External Memory and Project Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03585v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug. MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 7 figures |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

However, existing debuggers are primarily tailored for human interaction, and those designed for programmatic debugging focus on kernel space, resulting in limited functionality in userland. To fill this gap, we introduce libdebug, a Python library for programmatic debugging of userland binary executables. libdebug offers a user-friendly API that enables developers to build custom debugging tools for various applications, including software engineering, reverse engineering, and software security. It is released as an open-source project, along with comprehensive documentation to encourage use and collaboration across the community. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of libdebug through case studies and benchmarks, all of which are publicly available. We find that the median latency of syscall and breakpoint handling in libdebug is 3 to 4 times lower compared to that of GDB.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAMBDA: A Large Model Based Data Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17535v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large language models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

This work introduces JITScope, an interactive visualization framework that illustrates how IR nodes and instructions evolve across compilation phases. The system features a full-stack architecture: a Python-based backend transforms raw JSON-formatted IR data-representing an abstract model of the JIT compiler IR-into a normalized SQLite database; a controller layer serves processed CSV data; and a D3.js-powered frontend renders an interactive, phase-aware graph of IR node transformations. The design emphasizes modularity, traceability, and flexibility. Our roadmap explores intuitive visual representations of phase-level changes in IR node connectivity, values, and access patterns. Ultimately, JITScope lays a foundation for future tooling that enables visual exploration of IR evolution, including phase filtering, value tracking, and function-access mapping-offering a new lens into the behaviors and impacts of compiler optimizations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 8 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

The chapter considers a debugging process in which a program is tested against different test cases. Two attributes, PASS and FAIL, represent the issue of the test case. The chapter extends the analysis of data mining for fault localization for the multiple fault situations. It addresses how data mining can be further applied to fault localization for GUI components. Unlike traditional software, GUI test cases are usually event sequences, and each individual event has a unique corresponding event handler.</p></details> |  |

Virtual Platforms (VPs) have become indispensable tools for this purpose as they serve as a platform to execute and debug the unmodified target software at an early design stage. With the increasing complexity of software, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, VPs need to provide high simulation speed to ensure the target software executes within a reasonable time. Hybrid simulation, which combines virtual models with real hardware, can improve the performance of VPs. This paper introduces a novel approach for integrating real Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices into SystemC-TLM-2.0-based VPs. The embedded PCI devices enable high performance, easy integration, and allow introspection for analysis and optimization. To illustrate the practical application of our approach, we present a case study where we integrate Google Coral's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) into an ARM-based VP. The integration allows efficient execution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while eliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating AI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression testing across architectures, and device communication analysis.

| **[Evaluating Mutation-based Fault Localization for Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09059v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to execute operations. They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Better Understanding of Probabilistic Delta Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04735v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a list L of elements and a property that L exhibits, ddmin is a well-known test input minimization algorithm designed to automatically eliminate irrelevant elements from L. This algorithm is extensively adopted in test input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced variant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Employing Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element in L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many should be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical probabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its superior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability and subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing this analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate analysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to better understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success rate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping inefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and previously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD has no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose CDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and implementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings. Comprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and software debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD despite its simplification. These insights provide valuable guidance for future research and applications of test input minimization algorithms.</p></details> | accepted by ICSE25 |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

In this work, we present a preliminary source mapping framework that establishes traceability between Solidity source code, LLVM IR, and zkEVM bytecode within the zkSolc compilation pipeline. Our approach addresses the traceability challenges introduced by non-linear transformations and proof-friendly optimizations in zero-knowledge compilation. To improve the reliability of mappings, we incorporate lightweight consistency checks based on static analysis and structural validation. We evaluate the framework on a dataset of 50 benchmark contracts and 500 real-world zkSync contracts, observing a mapping accuracy of approximately 97.2% for standard Solidity constructs. Expected limitations arise in complex scenarios such as inline assembly and deep inheritance hierarchies. The measured compilation overhead remains modest, at approximately 8.6%. Our initial results suggest that source mapping support in zero-knowledge compilation pipelines is feasible and can benefit debugging, auditing, and development workflows. We hope that this work serves as a foundation for further research and tool development aimed at improving developer experience in zk-Rollup environments.</p></details> |  |

Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025)</p></details> |

Exploring the Use of Android Record & Replay Tools in Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20237v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android User Interface (UI) testing is a critical research area due to the ubiquity of apps and the challenges faced by developers. Record and replay (R&R) tools facilitate manual and automated UI testing by recording UI actions to execute test scenarios and replay bugs. These tools typically support (i) regression testing, (ii) non-crashing functional bug reproduction, and (iii) crashing bug reproduction. However, prior work only examines these tools in fragmented settings, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across common use cases. We address this gap by conducting an empirical study on using R&R tools to record and replay non-crashing failures, crashing bugs, and feature-based user scenarios, and explore combining R&R with automated input generation (AIG) tools to replay crashing bugs. Our study involves one industrial and three academic R&R tools, 34 scenarios from 17 apps, 90 non-crashing failures from 42 apps, and 31 crashing bugs from 17 apps. Results show that 17% of scenarios, 38% of non-crashing bugs, and 44% of crashing bugs cannot be reliably recorded and replayed, mainly due to action interval resolution, API incompatibility, and Android tooling limitations. Our findings highlight key future research directions to enhance the practical application of R&R tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MobileSoft 2025</p></details> |

Put some Whamm on it!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20192v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and monitoring programs are integral to engineering and deploying software. Dynamic analyses monitor applications through source code or IR injection, machine code or bytecode rewriting, and virtual machine or direct hardware support. While these techniques are viable within their respective domains, common tooling across techniques is rare, leading to fragmentation of skills, duplicated efforts, and inconsistent feature support. We address this problem in the WebAssembly ecosystem with Whamm, a declarative instrumentation DSL for WebAssembly that abstracts above the instrumentation strategy, leveraging bytecode rewriting and engine support as available. Whamm solves three problems: 1) tooling fragmentation, 2) prohibitive instrumentation overhead of general-purpose frameworks, and 3) tedium of tailoring low-level high-performance mechanisms. Whamm provides fully-programmable instrumentation with declarative match rules, static and dynamic predication, automatic state reporting, and user library support, while achieving high performance through compiler and engine optimizations. At the back end, Whamm provides instrumentation to a Wasm engine as Wasm code, reusing existing engine optimizations and unlocking new ones, most notably intrinsification, to minimize overhead. In particular, explicitly requesting program state in match rules, rather than reflection, enables the engine to efficiently bundle arguments and even inline compiled probe logic. Whamm streamlines the tooling effort, as its bytecode-rewriting target can run instrumented programs everywhere, lowering fragmentation and advancing the state of the art for engine support. We evaluate Whamm with case studies of non-trivial monitors and show it is expressive, powerful, and efficient.</p></details> |  |

Sojourner under Sabotage, a browser-based serious game, reimagines this learning experience by blending education with an immersive and interactive storyline. Players take on the role of a spaceship crew member, using unit testing and debugging techniques to identify and repair sabotaged components across seven progressively challenging levels. A study with 79 students demonstrates that the game is a powerful tool for enhancing motivation, engagement, and skill development. These findings underscore the transformative potential of serious games in making essential software engineering practices accessible and enjoyable.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriDebug: A Unified LLM for Verilog Debugging via Contrastive Embedding and Guided Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19099v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in debugging for various programming languages. However, the application of LLMs to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging. Unlike existing methods, VeriDebug employs an embedding-based technique to accurately retrieve internal information, followed by bug-fixing. VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves 64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo (36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring Questions from Programming Screenshots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18912v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of generative AI into developer forums like Stack Overflow presents an opportunity to enhance problem-solving by allowing users to post screenshots of code or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) instead of traditional text-based queries. This study evaluates the effectiveness of various large language models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA, GEMINI, and GPT-4o in interpreting such visual inputs. We employ prompt engineering techniques, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot learning, to assess each model's responsiveness and accuracy. Our findings show that while GPT-4o shows promising capabilities, achieving over 60% similarity to baseline questions for 51.75% of the tested images, challenges remain in obtaining consistent and accurate interpretations for more complex images. This research advances our understanding of the feasibility of using generative AI for image-centric problem-solving in developer communities, highlighting both the potential benefits and current limitations of this approach while envisioning a future where visual-based debugging copilot tools become a reality.</p></details> |  |

Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability, especially their error rates across domains and the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o). Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025. Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error distributions. Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50% with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%. Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over 50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates (~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability (10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability. Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Healing Software Systems: Lessons from Nature, Powered by AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20093v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As modern software systems grow in complexity and scale, their ability to autonomously detect, diagnose, and recover from failures becomes increasingly vital. Drawing inspiration from biological healing - where the human body detects damage, signals the brain, and activates targeted recovery - this paper explores the concept of self-healing software driven by artificial intelligence. We propose a novel framework that mimics this biological model system observability tools serve as sensory inputs, AI models function as the cognitive core for diagnosis and repair, and healing agents apply targeted code and test modifications. By combining log analysis, static code inspection, and AI-driven generation of patches or test updates, our approach aims to reduce downtime, accelerate debugging, and enhance software resilience. We evaluate the effectiveness of this model through case studies and simulations, comparing it against traditional manual debugging and recovery workflows. This work paves the way toward intelligent, adaptive and self-reliant software systems capable of continuous healing, akin to living organisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Interactive Debugger for Rust Trait Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18704v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiler diagnostics for type inference failures are notoriously bad, and type classes only make the problem worse. By introducing a complex search process during inference, type classes can lead to wholly inscrutable or useless errors. We describe a system, Argus, for interactively visualizing type class inferences to help programmers debug inference failures, applied specifically to Rust's trait system. The core insight of Argus is to avoid the traditional model of compiler diagnostics as one-size-fits-all, instead providing the programmer with different views on the search tree corresponding to different debugging goals. Argus carefully uses defaults to improve debugging productivity, including interface design (e.g., not showing full paths of types by default) and heuristics (e.g., sorting obligations based on the expected complexity of fixing them). We evaluated Argus in a user study where $N = 25$ participants debugged type inference failures in realistic Rust programs, finding that participants using Argus correctly localized $2.2\times$ as many faults and localized $3.3\times$ faster compared to not using Argus.</p></details> |  |

These missing links and data obstruct both developers and, more recently, large language models (LLMs) working with unfamiliar code. We present Codetations, a system that helps developers contextualize documents with rich notes and tools. Unlike previous approaches, notes in Codetations stay outside the document to prevent code clutter, attaching to spans in the document using a hybrid edit-tracking/LLM-based method. Their content is dynamic, interactive, and synchronized with code changes. A worked example shows that relevant notes with interactively-collected data improve LLM performance during code repair. In our user evaluation, developers praised these properties and saw significant potential in annotation types that we generated with an LLM in just a few minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Adaptive Software Agents for Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18316v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using multiple agents was found to improve the debugging capabilities of Large Language Models. However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design, where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix, we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting. Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct their software goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, FSE2025</p></details> |

Diffing Build Logs with CiDiff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18182v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous integration (CI) is widely used by developers to ensure the quality and reliability of their software projects. However, diagnosing a CI regression is a tedious process that involves the manual analysis of lengthy build logs. In this paper, we explore how textual differencing can support the debugging of CI regressions. As off-the-shelf diff algorithms produce suboptimal results, in this work we introduce a new diff algorithm specifically tailored to build logs called CiDiff. We evaluate CiDiff against several baselines on a novel dataset of 17 906 CI regressions, performing an accuracy study, a quantitative study and a user-study. Notably, our algorithm reduces the number of lines to inspect by about 60 % in the median case, with reasonable overhead compared to the state-of-practice LCS-diff. Finally, our algorithm is preferred by the majority of participants in 70 % of the regression cases, whereas LCS-diff is preferred in only 5 % of the cases.</p></details> |  |

(2) Showcases modern features, including per-app address spaces, threading, commodity filesystems, USB, DMA, multicore, self-hosted debugging, and a window manager. (3) Supports rich applications such as 2D/3D games, music and video players, and a blockchain miner. Unlike traditional instructional systems, VOS emphasizes strong motivation for building systems-supporting engaging, media-rich apps that go beyond basic terminal programs. To achieve this, we design VOS to strike a careful balance between essential OS complexity and overall simplicity. Our method, which we call inverse engineering, breaks down a full-featured OS into a set of incremental, self-contained prototypes. Each prototype introduces a minimal set of OS mechanisms, driven by the needs of specific apps. The construction process (i.e., forward engineering) then progressively enables these apps by bringing up one mechanism at a time. VOS makes it accessible for a wider audience to experience building a software system that is self-contained and usable in everyday scenarios.</p></details> |  |

General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2025 AI4EDU Workshop</p></details> |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, to appear at FSE 2025</p></details> |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up industrial survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 17 images, 8 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, the lack of high-quality, scalable training datasets, especially those with verifiable outputs and intermediate reasoning traces-limits progress, particularly for open-source models. In this work, we present SWE-Synth, a framework for synthesizing realistic, verifiable, and process-aware bug-fix datasets at the repository level. SWE-Synth leverages LLM agents to simulate debugging workflows, producing not only bug-fix pairs but also test cases and structured repair trajectories. Compared to manually curated datasets, our method scales with minimal human effort while preserving contextual richness and correctness. Experiments show that models trained on SWE-Synth outperform those trained on real-world datasets by 2.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic, agent-generated data to advance the state of the art in APR and software engineering automation.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the complexity inherent to AI poses new challenges. Explainable AI (XAI) may allow developers to understand better the systems they build, which, in turn, can help with tasks like debugging. In this paper, we report insights from a series of surveys with software developers that highlight that there is indeed an increased need for explanatory tools to support developers in creating AI systems. However, the feedback also indicates that existing XAI systems still fall short of this aspiration. Thus, we see an unmet need to provide developers with adequate support mechanisms to cope with this complexity so they can embed AI into high-quality software in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Engineering Interactive Systems Embedding AI Technologies at EICS 2024, Tuesday June 25th, 2024 - Cagliary, Sardinia, Italy</p></details> |

It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools implement the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose ChaosEater, a system for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines the agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for Kubernetes systems, which are managed through code (i.e., Infrastructure as Code). Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater perform software engineering tasks to complete CE cycles, including requirement definition, code generation, debugging, and testing. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on both small and large Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it stably completes reasonable single CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. The CE cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>114 p...</summary><p>114 pages (7 main), 11 figures.

| **[Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15756v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p></details> |  |

In addition, it also serves as the cornerstone of the final sign-off, determining whether the chip is ready to be sent to the semiconductor foundry for fabrication. Recently, as the technology advance relentlessly, smaller metal pitches and the increasing number of devices have led to greater challenges and longer turn-around-time for experienced human designers to debug timing issues from the Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) timing reports. As a result, an efficient and intelligent methodology is highly necessary and essential for debugging timing issues and reduce the turnaround times. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise across various tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, incorporating reasoning and actions. In this work, we propose a timing analysis agent, that is empowered by multi-LLMs task solving, and incorporates a novel hierarchical planning and solving flow to automate the analysis of timing reports from commercial tool. In addition, we build a Timing Debug Relation Graph (TDRG) that connects the reports with the relationships of debug traces from experienced timing engineers. The timing analysis agent employs the novel Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, that includes agent and coding to retrieve data accurately, on the developed TDRG. In our studies, the proposed timing analysis agent achieves an average 98% pass-rate on a single-report benchmark and a 90% pass-rate for multi-report benchmark from industrial designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent That Debugs: Dynamic State-Guided Vulnerability Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07634v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, more vulnerabilities have been discovered every day, while manual vulnerability repair requires specialized knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, many detected or even published vulnerabilities remain unpatched, thereby increasing the exposure of software systems to attacks. Recent advancements in agents based on Large Language Models have demonstrated their increasing capabilities in code understanding and generation, which can be promising to achieve automated vulnerability repair. However, the effectiveness of agents based on static information retrieval is still not sufficient for patch generation. To address the challenge, we propose a program repair agent called VulDebugger that fully utilizes both static and dynamic context, and it debugs programs in a manner akin to humans. The agent inspects the actual state of the program via the debugger and infers expected states via constraints that need to be satisfied. By continuously comparing the actual state with the expected state, it deeply understands the root causes of the vulnerabilities and ultimately accomplishes repairs. We experimentally evaluated VulDebugger on 50 real-life projects. With 60.00% successfully fixed, VulDebugger significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for vulnerability repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Accurately Do Large Language Models Understand Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04372v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric. Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 600,010 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs. We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 78% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently Under Review.

We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Studying the Impact of Early Test Termination Due to Assertion Failure on Code Coverage and Spectrum-based Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04557v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An assertion is commonly used to validate the expected programs behavior (e.g., if the returned value of a method equals an expected value) in software testing. Although it is a recommended practice to use only one assertion in a single test to avoid code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette), it is common to have multiple assertions in a single test. One issue with tests that have multiple assertions is that when the test fails at an early assertion (not the last one), the test will terminate at that point, and the remaining testing code will not be executed. This, in turn, can potentially reduce the code coverage and the performance of techniques that rely on code coverage information (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization). We refer to such a scenario as early test termination. Understanding the impact of early test termination on test coverage is important for software testing and debugging, particularly for the techniques that rely on coverage information obtained from the testing. We conducted the first empirical study on early test termination due to assertion failure (i.e., early test termination) by investigating 207 versions of 6 open-source projects. We found that a nonnegligible portion of the failed tests (19.1%) is early terminated due to assertion failure. Our findings indicate that early test termination harms both code coverage and the effectiveness of spectrum-based fault localization. For instance, after eliminating early test termination, the line/branch coverage is improved in 55% of the studied versions, and improves the performance of two popular SBFL techniques Ochiai and Tarantula by 15.1% and 10.7% compared to the original setting (without eliminating early test termination) in terms of MFR, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaCoder: An Adaptive Planning and Multi-Agent Framework for Function-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04220v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, researchers have proposed many multi-agent frameworks for function-level code generation, which aim to improve software development productivity by automatically generating function-level source code based on task descriptions. A typical multi-agent framework consists of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that are responsible for task planning, code generation, testing, debugging, etc. Studies have shown that existing multi-agent code generation frameworks perform well on ChatGPT. However, their generalizability across other foundation LLMs remains unexplored systematically. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the generalizability of four state-of-the-art multi-agent code generation frameworks across six open-source LLMs with varying parameter sizes, architectures, and performance levels. Our study reveals the unstable generalizability of existing frameworks on diverse foundation LLMs. Based on the findings obtained from the empirical study, we propose AdaCoder, a novel adaptive planning, multi-agent framework for function-level code generation. AdaCoder has two phases. Phase-1 is an initial code generation step without planning, which uses an LLM-based coding agent and a script-based testing agent to unleash LLM's native power, identify cases beyond LLM's power, and determine the errors hindering execution. Phase-2 adds a rule-based debugging agent and an LLM-based planning agent for iterative code generation with planning. Our evaluation shows that AdaCoder achieves higher generalizability on diverse LLMs. Compared to the best baseline MapCoder, AdaCoder is on average 27.69% higher in Pass@1, 16 times faster in inference, and 12 times lower in token consumption.</p></details> |  |

However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Productively Deploying Emerging Models on Emerging Platforms: A Top-Down Approach for Testing and Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09151v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While existing machine learning (ML) frameworks focus on established platforms, like running CUDA on server-grade GPUs, there have been growing demands to enable emerging AI applications in a broader set of scenarios, such as running Large Language Models (LLMs) within browsers and mobile phones. However, deploying emerging models on new platforms (such as Metal and WebGPU) presents significant software engineering challenges due to rapid model evolution and limited tooling and practices for these platforms. Previous practice for ML model deployment often follows a bottom-up fashion, where engineers first implement individual required operators and then put them together. However, this traditional development approach fails to meet the productivity requirements when deploying emerging ML applications, with the testing and debugging part as a bottleneck. To this end, we introduce \textsc{TapML}, a top-down approach designed to streamline model deployment on diverse platforms. While the traditional bottom-up approach requires crafting manual tests, \textsc{TapML} automatically creates high-quality, realistic test data through operator-wise test carving. Furthermore, \textsc{TapML} uses a migration-based strategy to gradually offload model implementation from the mature source platform to the target platform, minimizing the debugging scope of compound errors. \textsc{TapML} has been used as the default development method in the MLC-LLM project to deploy emerging ML models. Within 2 years, \textsc{TapML} has accelerated the deployment of 105 emerging models in 27 model architectures across 5 emerging platforms. We show that \textsc{TapML} effectively boosts developer productivity while ensuring the quality of deployed models. Furthermore, we summarize comprehensive case studies from our real-world development, offering best practices for developing emerging ML systems.</p></details> |  |

While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bug Classification in Quantum Software: A Rule-Based Framework and Its Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10397v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36 Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to 85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393 (quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696), category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162), suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects, while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and hardware-related issues.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |
| **[ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10323v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |

However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning, LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% - 105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true positives.</p></details> |  |
| **[A First Look at Bugs in LLM Inference Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09713v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-specific inference engines (in short as \emph{LLM inference engines}) have become a fundamental component of modern AI infrastructure, enabling the deployment of LLM-powered applications (LLM apps) across cloud and local devices. Despite their critical role, LLM inference engines are prone to bugs due to the immense resource demands of LLMs and the complexities of cross-platform compatibility. However, a systematic understanding of these bugs remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first empirical study on bugs in LLM inference engines. We mine official repositories of 5 widely adopted LLM inference engines, constructing a comprehensive dataset of 929 real-world bugs. Through a rigorous open coding process, we analyze these bugs to uncover their symptoms, root causes, and commonality. Our findings reveal six major bug symptoms and a taxonomy of 28 root causes, shedding light on the key challenges in bug detection and location within LLM inference engines. Based on these insights, we propose a series of actionable implications for researchers, inference engine vendors, and LLM app developers.</p></details> | Under review |

However, many existing methods rely solely on single-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to simultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection (AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the lack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to insufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose TrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully leveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing pipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities, comprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems from both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative reasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle multiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong interpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two popular microservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that TrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%), FT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

The lack of interoperability between these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SPLASH 2025</p></details> |

Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation.

Although recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory. It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition, synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste.

Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Variability Effects On LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10204v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models (LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier (e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model (ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, code released here: https://github.com/SprocketLab/orm-code-verifier</p></details> |

There are also a few empirical studies that have examined the hypothesis, either explicitly or implicitly. The present work continues with and contributes to this research with a replication-motivated large-scale analysis of software written in the PHP programming language. The dataset examined contains nearly four hundred thousand open source software packages written in PHP. According to the results based on reported security vulnerabilities, the hypothesis does holds; packages having been affected by vulnerabilities over their release histories are generally more popular than packages without having been affected by a single vulnerability. With this replication results, the paper contributes to the efforts to strengthen the empirical knowledge base in cyber and software security.</p></details> | Resubmitted |
| **[The Effects of GitHub Copilot on Computing Students' Programming Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Processes in Brownfield Programming Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10051v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05) and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p < 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results and analysis are presented at https://ghcopilot-icer.github.io/.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |
| **[Automated Synthesis of Formally Verified Multi-Abstraction Function Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09550v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function summaries, which characterize the behavior of code segments (typically functions) through preconditions and postconditions, are essential for understanding, reusing, and verifying software, particularly in safety-critical domains like aerospace embedded systems. However, these mission-critical legacy code serving as a valuable reused asset often lacks formal specifications. It is challenging to automatically generate function summaries for C programs, due to the existence of complex features such as loops, nested function calls, pointer aliasing, and so on. Moreover, function summaries should support multiple abstraction levels to meet diverse requirements, e.g. precise summaries capturing full functionality for formal verification and intuitive summaries for human understanding. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel framework that combines symbolic execution, large language models (LLMs), and formal verification to generate Relatively Strongest Postconditions (RSPs) and build function summaries that fully capture program behavior. Our approach leverages VST-A's symbolic execution to precisely track program execution paths and state transitions, employs LLMs to infer loop invariants based on predefined templates, and uses Frama-C to guarantee soundness of generated summaries in an iterative refinement loop. Furthermore, from generated RSPs, we automatically synthesize strongest non-redundant postconditions expressed within given domain specific language. We compare our approach with existing work through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation using large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the choice of tokens during decoding, especially at points of uncertainty that critically affect the generated program's logic. Conventional decoding methods such as greedy search and beam search apply uniform treatment to all tokens, neglecting the unique uncertainty characteristics inherent in code generation, which can result in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis demonstrating that a significant portion of generation errors arises from incorrect token ranking at high-uncertainty steps, where the ground truth token exists in the candidate set but fails to be ranked first. Inspired by this insight, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework guided by token-level uncertainty quantified via Shannon entropy. AdaDec dynamically learns uncertainty thresholds tailored to each model and employs a pause-then-rerank mechanism with lookahead when the uncertainty surpasses these thresholds. Evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks reveals that AdaDec achieves up to a 15.5% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy compared to greedy decoding, matches or outperforms traditional beam search, and reduces both computational overhead and latency through targeted, selective pausing. Our findings suggest that uncertainty-aware adaptive decoding holds considerable potential for enhancing both the reliability and efficiency of code generation with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Rust Unit Test Coverage through Hybrid Program Analysis and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09002v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for ensuring software reliability and correctness. Classic Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human effort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software testing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[RocketPPA: Code-Level Power, Performance, and Area Prediction via LLM and Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21971v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents RocketPPA, a novel ultra-fast power, performance (delay), and area (PPA) estimator operating directly at the code-level abstraction using HDL code as input. The key technical innovation is its LLM-based regression model, which uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture composed of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The LLM interprets the input HDL code and then utilizes its final hidden-layer representations to predict PPA metrics. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable efficient LLM training. Furthermore, the work includes the development of an LLM-based HDL code repair framework to generate a large and synthesizable training dataset. Experimental results on the VerilogEval benchmark demonstrate that RocketPPA achieves significant improvements in the accuracy of PPA estimation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like Llama3-MetRex-8B. Specifically, at a 10% relative error threshold, RocketPPA enhances the pass rate for area prediction by 13.6%, delay by 9.4%, and power by 14.7%. At a 20% threshold, the improvements are 9.6% for area, 10.8% for delay, and 18.5% for power. Moreover, RocketPPA achieves a speedup of over 20x compared to MetRex and 30x over MasterRTL in processing the test set. The impact of RocketPPA is the potential to substantially accelerate the hardware design process by providing accurate PPA estimations early in the design cycle, thus avoiding the overhead of manual feature engineering and time-consuming synthesis flows.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClassInvGen: Class Invariant Synthesis using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18917v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal program specifications in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants have several benefits for the construction and maintenance of programs. They not only aid in program understanding due to their unambiguous semantics but can also be enforced dynamically (or even statically when the language supports a formal verifier). However, synthesizing high-quality specifications in an underlying programming language is limited by the expressivity of the specifications or the need to express them in a declarative manner. Prior work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing high-quality method pre/postconditions for Python and Java, but does not consider class invariants. In this work, we describe ClassInvGen, a method for co-generating executable class invariants and test inputs to produce high-quality class invariants for a mainstream language such as C++, leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize pure functions. We show that ClassInvGen outperforms a pure LLM-based technique to generate specifications (from code) as well as prior data-driven invariant inference techniques such as Daikon. We contribute a benchmark of standard C++ data structures along with a harness that can help measure both the correctness and completeness of generated specifications using tests and mutants. We also demonstrate its applicability to real-world code by performing a case study on several classes within a widely used and high-integrity C++ codebase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>JEL C...</summary><p>JEL Classification: O31, C88, J24, O35, L86</p></details> |

Traditional taint analysis can track such bytes white-box, but suffers from scalability issue. Fuzzing-Driven Taint Inference (FTI) offers a black-box alternative, yet typically incurs significant runtime overhead due to extra program executions. We observe that the commonly used havoc mutation scheme in fuzzing can be adapted for lightweight FTI with zero extra executions. We present a computational model of havoc mode, demonstrating that it can perform FTI while generating new test cases. Building on this, we propose ZTaint-Havoc, a novel, efficient FTI with minimal overhead (3.84% on UniBench, 12.58% on FuzzBench). We further design an effective mutation algorithm utilizing the identified hot bytes. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that ZTaint-Havoc, implemented in AFL++, improves edge coverage by up to 33.71% on FuzzBench and 51.12% on UniBench over vanilla AFL++, with average gains of 2.97% and 6.12% in 24-hour fuzzing campaigns.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on 34th ISSTA</p></details> |

The advanced capabilities of LLM-based programming assistants to support software development tasks have led to a rise in the adoption of LLMs in SE. However, little is known about the evidenced-based practices, tools and processes verified by research findings, supported and adopted by AI programming assistants. To this end, our work conducts a preliminary evaluation exploring the beliefs of LLM used to support software development tasks. We investigate 17 evidence-based claims posited by empirical SE research across five LLM-based programming assistants. Our findings show that LLM-based programming assistants have ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims and lack credible evidence to support responses. Based on our results, we provide implications for practitioners adopting LLM-based programming assistants in development contexts and shed light on future research directions to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs -- aiming to increase awareness and adoption of evidence-based SE research findings in practice.</p></details> |  |

This framework offers visualisations at various modelling stages and seamlessly integrates large language models and logical reasoning engines. The behavioural models generated with the assistance of LLMs are automatically translated into formal logical specifications.

These agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work, we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2) using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation -- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned with human development practices.</p></details> |  |

We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Worst-Case Symbolic Constraints Analysis and Generalisation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08171v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model, WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Output to Evaluation: Does Raw Instruction-Tuned Code LLMs Output Suffice for Fill-in-the-Middle Code Generation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18789v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-processing is crucial for the automatic evaluation of LLMs in fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code generation due to the frequent presence of extraneous code in raw outputs. This extraneous generation suggests a lack of awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned \texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing, especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However, post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is a random span of code.</p></details> | Work in progress |

To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.</p></details> |  |

With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), several studies have begun exploring their application to vulnerability detection tasks. However, existing studies primarily focus on specific programming languages (e.g., C/C++) and function-level detection, leaving the strengths and weaknesses of PLMs and LLMs in multilingual and multi-granularity scenarios largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive fine-grained empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of state-of-the-art PLMs and LLMs for multilingual vulnerability detection. Using over 30,000 real-world vulnerability-fixing patches across seven programming languages, we systematically assess model performance at both the function-level and line-level. Our key findings indicate that GPT-4o, enhanced through instruction tuning and few-shot prompting, significantly outperforms all other evaluated models, including CodeT5P. Furthermore, the LLM-based approach demonstrates superior capability in detecting unique multilingual vulnerabilities, particularly excelling in identifying the most dangerous and high-severity vulnerabilities. These results underscore the promising potential of adopting LLMs for multilingual vulnerability detection at function-level and line-level, revealing their complementary strengths and substantial improvements over PLM approaches. This first empirical evaluation of PLMs and LLMs for multilingual vulnerability detection highlights LLMs' value in addressing real-world software security challenges.</p></details> | 33 pages, 9 figures |

Frequent updates in software libraries break working code that needs to be refactored, thus adding complexity to an already complex landscape. These refactoring challenges are, in many cases, fundamentally different from those known in classical software engineering due to the nature of quantum computing software. This study addresses these challenges by developing a taxonomy of quantum circuit's refactoring problems, providing a structured framework to analyze and compare different refactoring approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven valuable tools for classic software development, yet their value in quantum software engineering remains unexplored. This study uses LLMs to categorize refactoring needs in migration scenarios between different Qiskit versions. Qiskit documentation and release notes were scrutinized to create an initial taxonomy of refactoring required for migrating between Qiskit releases. Two taxonomies were produced: one by expert developers and one by an LLM. These taxonomies were compared, analyzing differences and similarities, and were integrated into a unified taxonomy that reflects the findings of both methods. By systematically categorizing refactoring challenges in Qiskit, the unified taxonomy is a foundation for future research on AI-assisted migration while enabling a more rigorous evaluation of automated refactoring techniques. Additionally, this work contributes to quantum software engineering (QSE) by enhancing software development workflows, improving language compatibility, and promoting best practices in quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ASQC JAIIO 54 (https://54jaiio.sadio.org.ar/simposios/)</p></details> |

However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies show that deep learning models are sensitive to the input variations, but few studies have systematically studied the robustness of Transformer under perturbed input code. In this work, we empirically study the effect of semantic-preserving code transformation on the performance of Transformer. Specifically, 24 and 27 code transformation strategies are implemented for two popular programming languages, Java and Python, respectively. For facilitating analysis, the strategies are grouped into five categories: block transformation, insertion/deletion transformation, grammatical statement transformation, grammatical token transformation, and identifier transformation. Experiments on three popular code intelligence tasks, including code completion, code summarization and code search, demonstrate insertion/deletion transformation and identifier transformation show the greatest impact on the performance of Transformer. Our results also suggest that Transformer based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) shows more robust performance than the model based on only code sequence under most code transformations. Besides, the design of positional encoding can impact the robustness of Transformer under code transformation. Based on our findings, we distill some insights about the challenges and opportunities for Transformer-based code intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by TSE (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843180/).

| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

As CPS grow in complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software, and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for automated and comparative evaluation. Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly compose systems or integrate components across platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed, component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and development.</p></details> |  |

We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The lack of interoperability between these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SPLASH 2025</p></details> |

However, how users perceive, evaluate, and critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with 894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies. Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes: positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g., scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained, co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis. To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Effective ML monitoring requires rich contextual information to move beyond detecting statistical shifts toward meaningful alerts and systematic root-cause analysis. Yet, surprisingly, despite extensive research in ML monitoring and related disciplines (drift detection, data validation, out-of-distribution detection), there is no shared understanding of how to use contextual information -- striking, given that monitoring involves interpretation of information in context. In response, this paper presents a systematic review to characterize and structure the various types of contextual information in this domain. Our analysis examines 94 primary studies across data mining, databases, software engineering, and ML. We introduce the Contextual System--Aspect--Representation (C-SAR) framework, a conceptual model that synthesizes our findings. We also identify 20 recurring and potentially reusable patterns of specific system, aspect, and representation combinations, and map them to the monitoring activities they support. This study provides a new perspective on ML monitoring: from interpreting "tea leaves" of observational statistics into constructing and managing "system maps" that enable systematic and reliable ML monitoring practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Pre-trained Large Language Models for Repairing Declarative Formal Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11050v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention as a practical research domain focused on automatically fixing bugs in programs. While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

While changed files are commonly presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100 popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for 44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order. Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests, where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than following a single predefined order.</p></details> |  |

However, the availability of hardware often lags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this, Virtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a pivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified target software. In this study, we propose an approach leveraging containerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies and enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as open-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat licenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study. Through our research, we offer a robust solution to address the challenges posed by the complexity of HW/SW systems, with practical implications for accelerating HW/SW co-development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in DVCon China 2025</p></details> |

Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Internetware 2025</p></details> |

Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.

| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXPEREPAIR: Dual-Memory Enhanced LLM-based Repository-Level Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10484v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically repairing software issues remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of software engineering and AI. Although recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory. It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition, synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Network Methods for Hub-like Microservice Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07683v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Microservice Architecture is a popular architectural paradigm that facilitates flexibility by decomposing applications into small, independently deployable services. Catalogs of architectural anti-patterns have been proposed to highlight the negative aspects of flawed microservice design. In particular, the Hub-like anti-pattern lacks an unambiguous definition and detection method. Aim: In this work, we aim to find a robust detection approach for the Hub-like microservice anti-pattern that outputs a reasonable number of Hub-like candidates with high precision. Method: We leveraged a dataset of 25 microservice networks and several network hub detection techniques to identify the Hub-like anti-pattern, namely scale-free property, centrality metrics and clustering coefficient, minimum description length principle, and the approach behind the Arcan tool. Results and Conclusion: Our findings revealed that the studied architectural networks are not scale-free, that most considered hub detection approaches do not agree on the detected hubs, and that the method by Kirkley leveraging the Erdos-Renyi encoding is the most accurate one in terms of the number of detected hubs and the detection precision. Investigating further the applicability of these methods to detecting Hub-like components in microservice-based and other systems opens up new research directions. Moreover, our results provide an evaluation of the approach utilized by the widely used Arcan tool and highlight the potential to update the tool to use the normalized degree centrality of a component in the network, or for the approach based on ER encoding to be adopted instead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Centrality Change Proneness: an Early Indicator of Microservice Architectural Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07690v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, the wide adoption of Microservice Architecture has required the identification of various patterns and anti-patterns to prevent Microservice Architectural Degradation. Frequently, the systems are modelled as a network of connected services. Recently, the study of temporal networks has emerged as a way to describe and analyze evolving networks. Previous research has explored how software metrics such as size, complexity, and quality are related to microservice centrality in the architectural network. This study investigates whether temporal centrality metrics can provide insight into the early detection of architectural degradation by correlating or affecting software metrics. We reconstructed the architecture of 7 releases of an OSS microservice project with 42 services. For every service in every release, we computed the software and centrality metrics. From one of the latter, we derived a new metric, Centrality Change Proneness. We then explored the correlation between the metrics. We identified 7 size and 5 complexity metrics that have a consistent correlation with centrality, while Centrality Change Proneness did not affect the software metrics, thus providing yet another perspective and an early indicator of microservice architectural degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bug Classification in Quantum Software: A Rule-Based Framework and Its Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10397v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36 Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to 85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393 (quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696), category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162), suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects, while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and hardware-related issues.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

The automation of UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task; however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and 3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AutoGEEval++: A Multi-Level and Multi-Geospatial-Modality Automated Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models in Geospatial Code Generation on Google Earth Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10365v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial code generation is becoming a key frontier in integrating artificial intelligence with geo-scientific analysis, yet standardised automated evaluation tools for this task remain absent. This study presents AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24 state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose, reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types, model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeTool: Enhancing Programmatic Tool Invocation of LLMs via Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20840v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool invocation significantly enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet challenges persist, particularly in complex task scenarios. Current methods, such as instruction-enhanced reasoning and supervised fine-tuning, often result in unnecessarily long reasoning paths and face difficulties in verifying the correctness of intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose CodeTool, a novel framework for stepwise code generation that improves LLM tool invocation by leveraging the concise and easily verifiable nature of code. CodeTool incorporates two distinct process rewards: the On-the-spot Reward, which provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of each tool invocation, and the Latent Reward, which assesses the contribution of each step toward overall task completion. By maximizing the cumulative reward of the On-the-spot and Latend Rewards at each step, LLMs are guided to follow efficient and accurate reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench-TMDB demonstrate the superiority of CodeTool over existing approaches.</p></details> | ACL2025 |
| **[Augmenting Large Language Models with Static Code Analysis for Automated Code Quality Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10330v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |
| **[ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10323v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |
| **[Minimizing False Positives in Static Bug Detection via LLM-Enhanced Path Feasibility Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10322v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality. However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning, LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% - 105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true positives.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a systematic review of software vulnerability detection (SVD) research from 2018 to 2023, offering a comprehensive taxonomy of techniques, feature representations, and embedding methods. Our analysis reveals that 91% of studies use AI-based methods, with graph-based models being the most prevalent. We identify key limitations, including dataset quality, reproducibility, and interpretability, and highlight emerging opportunities in underexplored techniques such as federated learning and quantum neural networks, providing a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |

We report a usability trial with 7 experienced Seccomp developers exploring how they approached sandboxing an application and the difficulties they faced. The developers each approached sandboxing the application differently and each came to different solutions. We highlight many challenges of using Seccomp, the sandboxing designs by the participants, and what developers think would make it easier for them to sandbox applications effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Variability Effects On LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10204v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Fault Domains for Conformance Testing of Finite State Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19405v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fault domain reflects a tester's assumptions about faults that may occur in an implementation and that need to be detected during testing. A fault domain that has been widely studied in the literature on black-box conformance testing is the class of finite state machines (FSMs) with at most $m$ states. Numerous strategies for generating test suites have been proposed that guarantee fault coverage for this class. These so-called $m$-complete test suites grow exponentially in $m-n$, where $n$ is the number of states of the specification, so one can only run them for small values of $m-n$. But the assumption that $m-n$ is small is not realistic in practice. In his seminal paper from 1964, Hennie raised the challenge to design checking experiments in which the number of states may increase appreciably. In order to solve this long-standing open problem, we propose (much larger) fault domains that capture the assumption that all states in an implementation can be reached by first performing a sequence from some set $A$ (typically a state cover for the specification), followed by $k$ arbitrary inputs, for some small $k$. The number of states of FSMs in these fault domains grows exponentially in $k$. We present a sufficient condition for $k$-$A$-completeness of test suites with respect to these fault domains. Our condition implies $k$-$A$-completeness of two prominent $m$-complete test suite generation strategies, the Wp and HSI methods. Thus these strategies are complete for much larger fault domains than those for which they were originally designed, and thereby solve Hennie's challenge. We show that three other prominent $m$-complete methods (H, SPY and SPYH) do not always generate $k$-$A$-complete test suites.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 11 figures, to appear in proceedings CONCUR 2025</p></details> |
| **[D-LiFT: Improving LLM-based Decompiler Backend via Code Quality-driven Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10125v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances, their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}. Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle, D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically, D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-SCORE.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However, challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models (LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier (e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model (ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, code released here: https://github.com/SprocketLab/orm-code-verifier</p></details> |

This literature review explores how modern event-driven and microservices-based architectures, particularly those leveraging Apache Kafka, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Kubernetes are transforming retail and financial systems. By systematically reviewing academic publications, technical white papers, and industry reports from recent years, this study synthesizes key themes and implementation strategies. The analysis reveals that technologies like Kafka and Spring Boot are instrumental in building low-latency, event-driven applications that support real-time analytics and fraud detection, while MongoDB, when deployed on Kubernetes, ensures fault tolerance and high availability in inventory and transaction systems. Kubernetes itself plays a crucial role in automating deployment and scaling of microservices. These findings provide valuable insights for industry practitioners aiming to design scalable infrastructures, identify research opportunities in hybrid deployment models, and offer educators a foundation to integrate modern system architectures into professional and technical communication training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing a Safety Case: Bottom-up Guidance for Claims and Evidence Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09929v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Automated Driving Systems (ADS) technology advances, ensuring safety and public trust requires robust assurance frameworks, with safety cases emerging as a critical tool toward such a goal. This paper explores an approach to assess how a safety case is supported by its claims and evidence, toward establishing credibility for the overall case. Starting from a description of the building blocks of a safety case (claims, evidence, and optional format-dependent entries), this paper delves into the assessment of support of each claim through the provided evidence. Two domains of assessment are outlined for each claim: procedural support (formalizing process specification) and implementation support (demonstrating process application). Additionally, an assessment of evidence status is also undertaken, independently from the claims support. Scoring strategies and evaluation guidelines are provided, including detailed scoring tables for claim support and evidence status assessment. The paper further discusses governance, continual improvement, and timing considerations for safety case assessments. Reporting of results and findings is contextualized within its primary use for internal decision-making on continual improvement efforts. The presented approach builds on state of the art auditing practices, but specifically tackles the question of judging the credibility of a safety case. While not conclusive on its own, it provides a starting point toward a comprehensive "Case Credibility Assessment" (CCA), starting from the evaluation of the support for each claim (individually and in aggregate), as well as every piece of evidence provided. By delving into the technical intricacies of ADS safety cases, this work contributes to the ongoing discourse on safety assurance and aims to facilitate the responsible integration of ADS technology into society.</p></details> |  |

There are also a few empirical studies that have examined the hypothesis, either explicitly or implicitly. The present work continues with and contributes to this research with a replication-motivated large-scale analysis of software written in the PHP programming language. The dataset examined contains nearly four hundred thousand open source software packages written in PHP. According to the results based on reported security vulnerabilities, the hypothesis does holds; packages having been affected by vulnerabilities over their release histories are generally more popular than packages without having been affected by a single vulnerability. With this replication results, the paper contributes to the efforts to strengthen the empirical knowledge base in cyber and software security.</p></details> | Resubmitted |

Quantum can complement classical resources for specific workloads, but their adoption depends on integration into existing HPC infrastructure. Treating quantum devices as first-class resources allows for unified scheduling, improved usability, and support for hybrid quantum-classical applications. This paper presents the design architecture and reference implementation for quantum resources control using existing workload management systems. We introduce a suite of plugins for Slurm that enable integration of on-prem and cloud quantum computing resources into existing high-performance computing centers. The paper details the interface design, plugin concept and implementation, operational aspects for heterogeneous compute clusters, as well as considerations for other resource management systems.</p></details> |  |

In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05) and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p < 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks.

At the same time, SHI is already common in commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10) with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. To address this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to advance rAI development in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2025 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency FAccT'25</p></details> |

Many approaches have been proposed to automatically discover simulation models from historical event logs, reducing the cost and time to manually design them. However, in dynamic business environments, organizations continuously refine their processes to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Existing techniques to process simulation discovery lack adaptability to real-time operational changes. In this paper, we propose a streaming process simulation discovery technique that integrates Incremental Process Discovery with Online Machine Learning methods. This technique prioritizes recent data while preserving historical information, ensuring adaptation to evolving process dynamics. Experiments conducted on four different event logs demonstrate the importance in simulation of giving more weight to recent data while retaining historical knowledge. Our technique not only produces more stable simulations but also exhibits robustness in handling concept drift, as highlighted in one of the use cases.</p></details> |  |

However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2) reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate, node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.

| **[Towards Bridging Formal Methods and Human Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09759v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) are integral to model checking and design repair tools. System engineers frequently examine LTS designs during model checking or design repair to debug, identify inconsistencies, and validate system behavior. Despite LTS's significance, no prior research has examined human comprehension of these designs. To address this, we draw on traditional software engineering and graph theory, identifying 7 key metrics: cyclomatic complexity, state space size, average branching factor, maximum depth, Albin complexity, modularity, and redundancy. We created a dataset of 148 LTS designs, sampling 48 for 324 paired comparisons, and ranked them using the Bradley-Terry model. Through Kendall's Tau correlation analysis, we found that Albin complexity ($\tau = 0.444$), state space size ($\tau = 0.420$), cyclomatic complexity ($\tau = 0.366$), and redundancy ($\tau = 0.315$) most accurately reflect human comprehension of LTS designs. To showcase the metrics' utility, we applied the Albin complexity metric within the Fortis design repair tool, ranking system redesigns. This ranking reduced annotators' comprehension time by 39\%, suggesting that metrics emphasizing human factors can enhance formal design interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to improve data annotation process in methodology section</p></details> |
| **[A First Look at Bugs in LLM Inference Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09713v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-specific inference engines (in short as \emph{LLM inference engines}) have become a fundamental component of modern AI infrastructure, enabling the deployment of LLM-powered applications (LLM apps) across cloud and local devices. Despite their critical role, LLM inference engines are prone to bugs due to the immense resource demands of LLMs and the complexities of cross-platform compatibility. However, a systematic understanding of these bugs remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first empirical study on bugs in LLM inference engines. We mine official repositories of 5 widely adopted LLM inference engines, constructing a comprehensive dataset of 929 real-world bugs. Through a rigorous open coding process, we analyze these bugs to uncover their symptoms, root causes, and commonality. Our findings reveal six major bug symptoms and a taxonomy of 28 root causes, shedding light on the key challenges in bug detection and location within LLM inference engines. Based on these insights, we propose a series of actionable implications for researchers, inference engine vendors, and LLM app developers.</p></details> | Under review |

Manual analysis of NVD references showed Git references enable over 86% success, while non-Git references achieve under 14%. Using these findings, we built an automated pipeline extracting 31,942 VFCs from 20,360 NVD records (8.7% of 235,341) with 87% precision, mainly from Git references. To fill gaps, we mined six external security databases, yielding 29,254 VFCs for 18,985 records (8.1%) at 88.4% precision, and GitHub repositories, adding 3,686 VFCs for 2,795 records (1.2%) at 73% precision. Combining these, we mapped 26,710 unique records (11.3% coverage) from 7,634 projects, with overlap between NVD and external databases, plus unique GitHub contributions. Despite success with Git references, 88.7% of records remain unmapped, highlighting the difficulty without Git links. This study offers insights for enhancing vulnerability datasets and guiding future automated security research.</p></details> |  |

We delve deeper into the tools and compare them across different dimensions and granularity - for example, whether their measurement encompasses energy and carbon emissions and the components considered (like CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.). We present our observations on the practical use (component wise consolidation of approaches) as well as the challenges that we have identified across the current state-of-the-art. As we start an initiative to address these challenges, we emphasize active collaboration across the community in this important field.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 291 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the use of Kapture, a formal modelling tool developed by D-RisQ, to translate an existing formal VDM model of a medical implant for treating focal epilepsy called CANDO. The work was undertaken without prior experience in formal methods. The paper assess Kapture's usability, the challenges of formal modelling, and the effectiveness of the translated model. The result is a model in Kapture which covers over 90% of the original VDM model, and produces matching traces of results. While several issues were encountered during design and implementation, mainly due to the initial learning curve, this paper demonstrates that complex systems can be effectively modelled in Kapture by inexperienced users and highlights some difficulties in translating VDM specifications to Kapture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 23rd Overture workshop, June 2025 (arXiv:cs/2506.08680)</p></details> |
| **[ASTAGEN: Empirical Evaluation of Automated SATD Taxonomy Generation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09601v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technical debt refers to suboptimal code that degrades software quality. When developers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its categories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing such taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding code, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to annotator subjectivity. This study presents ASTAGEN, an initial step toward automating SATD taxonomy generation using large language models (LLMs). Given a comment and its surrounding code, ASTAGEN first generates a concise explanation for each SATD comment, then incrementally generates and updates categories to construct a taxonomy. We evaluate ASTAGEN on SATD datasets from three domains: quantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully recovers domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer Configuration in machine learning. Compared to a naive use of an LLM, ASTAGEN produces more consistent category assignments due to its explanation-driven, iterative design. It also completes taxonomy generation in under two hours and for less than one USD, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that while full automation remains challenging, ASTAGEN is able to support semi-automated taxonomy construction. Furthermore, our work opens up avenues for future work, such as automatic taxonomy generation in other areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Synthesis of Formally Verified Multi-Abstraction Function Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09550v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function summaries, which characterize the behavior of code segments (typically functions) through preconditions and postconditions, are essential for understanding, reusing, and verifying software, particularly in safety-critical domains like aerospace embedded systems. However, these mission-critical legacy code serving as a valuable reused asset often lacks formal specifications. It is challenging to automatically generate function summaries for C programs, due to the existence of complex features such as loops, nested function calls, pointer aliasing, and so on. Moreover, function summaries should support multiple abstraction levels to meet diverse requirements, e.g. precise summaries capturing full functionality for formal verification and intuitive summaries for human understanding. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel framework that combines symbolic execution, large language models (LLMs), and formal verification to generate Relatively Strongest Postconditions (RSPs) and build function summaries that fully capture program behavior. Our approach leverages VST-A's symbolic execution to precisely track program execution paths and state transitions, employs LLMs to infer loop invariants based on predefined templates, and uses Frama-C to guarantee soundness of generated summaries in an iterative refinement loop. Furthermore, from generated RSPs, we automatically synthesize strongest non-redundant postconditions expressed within given domain specific language. We compare our approach with existing work through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |

It estimates the model's capability, elucidates behavior characteristics, and facilitates the identification of potential issues and limitations, thereby guiding further improvement. Given that LLMs' diverse task-handling abilities stem from large volumes of training data, a comprehensive evaluation also necessitates abundant, well-annotated, and representative test data to assess LLM performance across various downstream tasks. However, the demand for high-quality test data often entails substantial time, computational resources, and manual efforts, sometimes causing the evaluation to be inefficient or impractical. To address these challenges, researchers propose active testing, which estimates the overall performance by selecting a subset of test data. Nevertheless, the existing active testing methods tend to be inefficient, even inapplicable, given the unique new challenges of LLMs (e.g., diverse task types, increased model complexity, and unavailability of training data). To mitigate such limitations and expedite the development cycle of LLMs, in this work, we introduce AcTracer, an active testing framework tailored for LLMs that strategically selects a small subset of test data to achieve a more accurate performance estimation for LLMs. AcTracer utilizes both internal and external information from LLMs to guide the test sampling process, reducing variance through a multi-stage pool-based active selection. Our experiment results demonstrate that AcTracer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods across various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (2025)</p></details> |

However, many existing methods rely solely on single-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to simultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection (AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the lack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to insufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose TrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully leveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing pipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities, comprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems from both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative reasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle multiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong interpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two popular microservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that TrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%), FT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning as a Resource: Optimizing Fast and Slow Thinking in Code Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09396v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This position paper proposes a fundamental shift in designing code generation models: treating reasoning depth as a controllable resource. Rather than being an incidental byproduct of prompting, we argue that the trade-off between rapid, direct answers ("fast thinking") and elaborate, chain-of-thought deliberation ("slow thinking") must be explicitly managed. We contend that optimizing reasoning budgets across the entire model lifecycle - from synthetic data creation and benchmarking to real-world deploymen - can unlock superior trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost. This paper outlines how adaptive control over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new multi-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious deployment policies. By viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes to be scheduled, we envision coding agents that think deep when necessary and act fast when possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation using large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the choice of tokens during decoding, especially at points of uncertainty that critically affect the generated program's logic. Conventional decoding methods such as greedy search and beam search apply uniform treatment to all tokens, neglecting the unique uncertainty characteristics inherent in code generation, which can result in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis demonstrating that a significant portion of generation errors arises from incorrect token ranking at high-uncertainty steps, where the ground truth token exists in the candidate set but fails to be ranked first. Inspired by this insight, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework guided by token-level uncertainty quantified via Shannon entropy. AdaDec dynamically learns uncertainty thresholds tailored to each model and employs a pause-then-rerank mechanism with lookahead when the uncertainty surpasses these thresholds. Evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks reveals that AdaDec achieves up to a 15.5% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy compared to greedy decoding, matches or outperforms traditional beam search, and reduces both computational overhead and latency through targeted, selective pausing. Our findings suggest that uncertainty-aware adaptive decoding holds considerable potential for enhancing both the reliability and efficiency of code generation with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less is More: DocString Compression in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22793v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering has intensified the need for improved model and resource efficiency. In particular, for neural code generation, LLMs are used to translate function/method signature and DocString to executable code. DocStrings which capture user re quirements for the code and used as the prompt for LLMs, often contains redundant information. Recent advancements in prompt compression have shown promising results in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their applicability to code generation remains uncertain. Our empirical study show that the state-of-the-art prompt compression methods achieve only about 10% reduction, as further reductions would cause significant performance degradation. In our study, we propose a novel compression method, ShortenDoc, dedicated to DocString compression for code generation. Our extensive experiments on six code generation datasets, five open-source LLMs (1B to 10B parameters), and one closed-source LLM GPT-4o confirm that ShortenDoc achieves 25-40% compression while preserving the quality of generated code, outperforming other baseline methods at similar compression levels. The benefit of this research is to improve efficiency and reduce the cost while maintaining the quality of the generated code, especially when calling third-party APIs, and is able to reduce the token processing cost by 25-40%.</p></details> | TOSEM |

This survey systematically reviews RL-driven techniques across the code development lifecycle, from compiler-level optimizations and resource allocation strategies to end-to-end code synthesis frameworks. We first examine classical and modern RL algorithms -- spanning policy gradients, actor-critic methods, human-feedback alignment, and preference-based optimization -- and their adaptations to the unique challenges of code generation, such as sparse and delayed rewards. Next, we analyze key benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics that drive progress in RL-augmented Code LLMs. Finally, we identify open problems, including the need for richer feedback sources, support for low-level and domain-specific languages, and methods to reduce computational overhead. By consolidating current insights and outlining future directions, this work aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging RL to produce more robust, efficient, and human-aligned code generation systems.</p></details> |  |

Exposing and Trapping Undecidable Patches and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03651v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantity and quality of vulnerability datasets are essential for developing deep learning solutions to vulnerability-related tasks. Due to the limited availability of vulnerabilities, a common approach to building such datasets is analyzing security patches in source code. However, existing security patches often suffer from inaccurate labels, insufficient contextual information, and undecidable patches that fail to clearly represent the root causes of vulnerabilities or their fixes. These issues introduce noise into the dataset, which can mislead detection models and undermine their effectiveness. To address these issues, we present mono, a novel LLM-powered framework that simulates human experts' reasoning process to construct reliable vulnerability datasets. mono introduces three key components to improve security patch datasets: (i) semantic-aware patch classification for precise vulnerability labeling, (ii) iterative contextual analysis for comprehensive code understanding, and (iii) systematic root cause analysis to identify and filter undecidable patches. Our comprehensive evaluation on the MegaVul benchmark demonstrates that mono can correct 31.0% of labeling errors, recover 89% of inter-procedural vulnerabilities, and reveals that 16.7% of CVEs contain undecidable patches. Furthermore, mono's enriched context representation improves existing models' vulnerability detection accuracy by 15%. We open source the framework mono and the dataset MonoLens in https://github.com/vul337/mono.</p></details> |  |

With this widespread penetration, the carbon emissions of software are rapidly growing as well, thereby negatively impacting the long-term sustainability of our environment. Hence, optimizing software from a sustainability standpoint becomes more crucial than ever. We believe that the adoption of automated tools that can identify energy-inefficient patterns in the code and guide appropriate refactoring can significantly assist in this optimization. In this extended abstract, we present an industry case study that evaluates the sustainability impact of refactoring energy-inefficient code patterns identified by automated software sustainability assessment tools for a large application. Preliminary results highlight a positive impact on the application's sustainability post-refactoring, leading to a 29% decrease in per-user per-month energy consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages.

| **[Boosting Rust Unit Test Coverage through Hybrid Program Analysis and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09002v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for ensuring software reliability and correctness. Classic Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human effort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software testing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

State Manipulation is one of the notorious attacks in DeFi smart contracts, with price variable being the most commonly exploited state variable-attackers manipulate token prices to gain illicit profits. In this paper, we propose PriceSleuth, a novel method that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and static analysis to detect Price Manipulation (PM) attacks proactively. PriceSleuth firstly identifies core logic function related to price calculation in DeFi contracts. Then it guides LLM to locate the price calculation code statements. Secondly, PriceSleuth performs backward dependency analysis of price variables, instructing LLM in detecting potential price manipulation. Finally, PriceSleuth utilizes propagation analysis of price variables to assist LLM in detecting whether these variables are maliciously exploited. We presented preliminary experimental results to substantiate the effectiveness of PriceSleuth . And we outline future research directions for PriceSleuth.</p></details> |  |

However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes (e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models for review analysis. We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in 53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*). Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and ensuring reliable insights.</p></details> |  |

As a widely used benchmark for evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections, impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard entries, yield 18 and 11 ranking changes, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The key technical innovation is its LLM-based regression model, which uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture composed of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The LLM interprets the input HDL code and then utilizes its final hidden-layer representations to predict PPA metrics. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable efficient LLM training. Furthermore, the work includes the development of an LLM-based HDL code repair framework to generate a large and synthesizable training dataset. Experimental results on the VerilogEval benchmark demonstrate that RocketPPA achieves significant improvements in the accuracy of PPA estimation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like Llama3-MetRex-8B. Specifically, at a 10% relative error threshold, RocketPPA enhances the pass rate for area prediction by 13.6%, delay by 9.4%, and power by 14.7%. At a 20% threshold, the improvements are 9.6% for area, 10.8% for delay, and 18.5% for power. Moreover, RocketPPA achieves a speedup of over 20x compared to MetRex and 30x over MasterRTL in processing the test set. The impact of RocketPPA is the potential to substantially accelerate the hardware design process by providing accurate PPA estimations early in the design cycle, thus avoiding the overhead of manual feature engineering and time-consuming synthesis flows.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClassInvGen: Class Invariant Synthesis using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18917v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal program specifications in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants have several benefits for the construction and maintenance of programs. They not only aid in program understanding due to their unambiguous semantics but can also be enforced dynamically (or even statically when the language supports a formal verifier). However, synthesizing high-quality specifications in an underlying programming language is limited by the expressivity of the specifications or the need to express them in a declarative manner. Prior work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing high-quality method pre/postconditions for Python and Java, but does not consider class invariants. In this work, we describe ClassInvGen, a method for co-generating executable class invariants and test inputs to produce high-quality class invariants for a mainstream language such as C++, leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize pure functions. We show that ClassInvGen outperforms a pure LLM-based technique to generate specifications (from code) as well as prior data-driven invariant inference techniques such as Daikon. We contribute a benchmark of standard C++ data structures along with a harness that can help measure both the correctness and completeness of generated specifications using tests and mutants. We also demonstrate its applicability to real-world code by performing a case study on several classes within a widely used and high-integrity C++ codebase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formal Methods Meets Readability: Auto-Documenting JML Java Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09230v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates whether formal specifications using Java Modeling Language (JML) can enhance the quality of Large Language Model (LLM)-generated Javadocs. While LLMs excel at producing documentation from code alone, we hypothesize that incorporating formally verified invariants yields more complete and accurate results. We present a systematic comparison of documentation generated from JML-annotated and non-annotated Java classes, evaluating quality through both automated metrics and expert analysis. Our findings demonstrate that JML significantly improves class-level documentation completeness, with more moderate gains at the method level. Formal specifications prove particularly effective in capturing complex class invariants and design contracts that are frequently overlooked in code-only documentation. A threshold effect emerges, where the benefits of JML become more pronounced for classes with richer sets of invariants. While JML enhances specification coverage, its impact on core descriptive quality is limited, suggesting that formal specifications primarily ensure comprehensive coverage rather than fundamentally altering implementation descriptions. These results offer actionable insights for software teams adopting formal methods in documentation workflows, highlighting scenarios where JML provides clear advantages. The study contributes to AI-assisted software documentation research by demonstrating how formal methods and LLMs can synergistically improve documentation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[How Do Users Revise Architectural Related Questions on Stack Overflow: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18959v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technical Questions and Answers (Q&A) sites, such as Stack Overflow (SO), accumulate a significant variety of information related to software development in posts from users. To ensure the quality of this information, SO encourages its users to review posts through various mechanisms (e.g., question and answer revision processes). Although Architecture Related Posts (ARPs) communicate architectural information that has a system-wide impact on development, little is known about how SO users revise information shared in ARPs. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical study to understand how users revise Architecture Related Questions (ARQs) on SO. We manually checked 13,205 ARPs and finally identified 4,114 ARQs that contain revision information. Our main findings are that: (1) The revision of ARQs is not prevalent in SO, and an ARQ revision starts soon after this question is posted (i.e., from 1 minute onward). Moreover, the revision of an ARQ occurs before and after this question receives its first answer/architecture solution, with most revisions beginning before the first architecture solution is posted. Both Question Creators (QCs) and non-QCs actively participate in ARQ revisions, with most revisions being made by QCs. (2) A variety of information (14 categories) is missing and further provided in ARQs after being posted, among which design context, component dependency, and architecture concern are dominant information. (3) Clarify the understanding of architecture under design and improve the readability of architecture problem are the two major purposes of the further provided information in ARQs. (4) The further provided information in ARQs has several impacts on the quality of answers/architecture solutions, including making architecture solution useful, making architecture solution informative, making architecture solution relevant, among others.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 7 images, 8 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

Global diffusion and impact of generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08945v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative coding tools promise big productivity gains, but uneven uptake could widen skill and income gaps. We train a neural classifier to spot AI-generated Python functions in 80 million GitHub commits (2018-2024) by 200,000 developers and track how fast--and where--these tools take hold. By December 2024, AI wrote an estimated 30.1% of Python functions from U.S. contributors, versus 24.3% in Germany, 23.2% in France, 21.6% in India, 15.4% in Russia and 11.7% in China. Newer GitHub users use AI more than veterans, while male and female developers adopt at similar rates. Within-developer fixed-effects models show that moving to 30% AI use raises quarterly commits by 2.4%. Coupling this effect with occupational task and wage data puts the annual value of AI-assisted coding in the United States at $9.6-$14.4 billion, rising to $64-$96 billion if we assume higher estimates of productivity effects reported by randomized control trials. Moreover, generative AI prompts learning and innovation, leading to increases in the number of new libraries and library combinations that programmers use. In short, AI usage is already widespread but highly uneven, and the intensity of use, not only access, drives measurable gains in output and exploration.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08379v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance individual productivity in guided settings. Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>JEL C...</summary><p>JEL Classification: O31, C88, J24, O35, L86</p></details> |

No previous work investigated the relationship between the behavioral uncertainty of a UAV, characterized in this work by inconsistent or erratic control signal patterns, and the unsafety of its flight. By quantifying uncertainty, it is possible to develop a predictor for unsafety, which acts as a flight supervisor. We conducted a large-scale empirical investigation of safety violations using PX4-Autopilot, an open-source UAV software platform. Our dataset of over 5,000 simulated flights, created to challenge obstacle avoidance, allowed us to explore the relation between uncertain UAV decisions and safety violations: up to 89% of unsafe UAV states exhibit significant decision uncertainty, and up to 74% of uncertain decisions lead to unsafe states. Based on these findings, we implemented Superialist (Supervising Autonomous Aerial Vehicles), a runtime uncertainty detector based on autoencoders, the state-of-the-art technology for anomaly detection. Superialist achieved high performance in detecting uncertain behaviors with up to 96% precision and 93% recall. Despite the observed performance degradation when using the same approach for predicting unsafety (up to 74% precision and 87% recall), Superialist enabled early prediction of unsafe states up to 50 seconds in advance.</p></details> | 39 pages |

Traditional taint analysis can track such bytes white-box, but suffers from scalability issue. Fuzzing-Driven Taint Inference (FTI) offers a black-box alternative, yet typically incurs significant runtime overhead due to extra program executions. We observe that the commonly used havoc mutation scheme in fuzzing can be adapted for lightweight FTI with zero extra executions. We present a computational model of havoc mode, demonstrating that it can perform FTI while generating new test cases. Building on this, we propose ZTaint-Havoc, a novel, efficient FTI with minimal overhead (3.84% on UniBench, 12.58% on FuzzBench). We further design an effective mutation algorithm utilizing the identified hot bytes. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that ZTaint-Havoc, implemented in AFL++, improves edge coverage by up to 33.71% on FuzzBench and 51.12% on UniBench over vanilla AFL++, with average gains of 2.97% and 6.12% in 24-hour fuzzing campaigns.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on 34th ISSTA</p></details> |

The advanced capabilities of LLM-based programming assistants to support software development tasks have led to a rise in the adoption of LLMs in SE. However, little is known about the evidenced-based practices, tools and processes verified by research findings, supported and adopted by AI programming assistants. To this end, our work conducts a preliminary evaluation exploring the beliefs of LLM used to support software development tasks. We investigate 17 evidence-based claims posited by empirical SE research across five LLM-based programming assistants. Our findings show that LLM-based programming assistants have ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims and lack credible evidence to support responses. Based on our results, we provide implications for practitioners adopting LLM-based programming assistants in development contexts and shed light on future research directions to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs -- aiming to increase awareness and adoption of evidence-based SE research findings in practice.</p></details> |  |

For developers, getting access to automated tools that analyze code and suggest sustainabilityrelated optimizations becomes extremely important from a learning and implementation perspective. However, there is currently a dearth of such tools due to the lack of standardized knowledge, which serves as the foundation of these tools. In this paper, we motivate the need for the development of a standard knowledge base of commonly occurring sustainability weaknesses in code, and propose an initial way of doing that. Furthermore, through preliminary experiments, we demonstrate why existing knowledge regarding software weaknesses cannot be re-tagged "as is" to sustainability without significant due diligence, thereby urging further explorations in this ecologically significant domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages.

Nevertheless, user models do not seem to be part of standard modeling languages nor common in current model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to analyze existing proposals for user modeling in MDE and identify their limitations. The results showcase that there is a lack of a unified and complete user modeling perspective. Instead, we observe a lot of fragmented and partial proposals considering only simple user dimensions and with lack of proper tool support. This limits the implementation of richer user interfaces able to better support the user-specific needs. Therefore, we hope this analysis triggers a discussion on the importance of user models and their inclusion in MDE pipelines. Especially in a context where, thanks to the rise of AI techniques, personalization, based on a rich number of user dimensions, is becoming more and more of a possibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA 2025)</p></details> |

An Investigative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08790v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener, more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or "greenness" of software is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and effective remediation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages.

| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Cure: LLM-based Competitor User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15724v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

As CPS grow in complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software, and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for automated and comparative evaluation. Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly compose systems or integrate components across platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed, component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Non-Code Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10833v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code understanding and generation; however, their effectiveness on non-code Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not One to Rule Them All: Mining Meaningful Code Review Orders From GitHub](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10654v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers use tools such as GitHub pull requests to review code, discuss proposed changes, and request modifications. While changed files are commonly presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100 popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for 44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order. Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests, where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than following a single predefined order.</p></details> |  |

However, the availability of hardware often lags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this, Virtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a pivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified target software. In this study, we propose an approach leveraging containerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies and enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as open-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat licenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study. Through our research, we offer a robust solution to address the challenges posed by the complexity of HW/SW systems, with practical implications for accelerating HW/SW co-development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in DVCon China 2025</p></details> |

Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.

| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bug Classification in Quantum Software: A Rule-Based Framework and Its Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10397v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36 Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to 85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393 (quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696), category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162), suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects, while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and hardware-related issues.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

The automation of UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task; however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the popular dataset Design2Code.

This study presents AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24 state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose, reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types, model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation.

| **[Augmenting Large Language Models with Static Code Analysis for Automated Code Quality Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10330v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |
| **[ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10323v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |
| **[New Fault Domains for Conformance Testing of Finite State Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19405v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fault domain reflects a tester's assumptions about faults that may occur in an implementation and that need to be detected during testing. A fault domain that has been widely studied in the literature on black-box conformance testing is the class of finite state machines (FSMs) with at most $m$ states. Numerous strategies for generating test suites have been proposed that guarantee fault coverage for this class. These so-called $m$-complete test suites grow exponentially in $m-n$, where $n$ is the number of states of the specification, so one can only run them for small values of $m-n$. But the assumption that $m-n$ is small is not realistic in practice. In his seminal paper from 1964, Hennie raised the challenge to design checking experiments in which the number of states may increase appreciably. In order to solve this long-standing open problem, we propose (much larger) fault domains that capture the assumption that all states in an implementation can be reached by first performing a sequence from some set $A$ (typically a state cover for the specification), followed by $k$ arbitrary inputs, for some small $k$. The number of states of FSMs in these fault domains grows exponentially in $k$. We present a sufficient condition for $k$-$A$-completeness of test suites with respect to these fault domains. Our condition implies $k$-$A$-completeness of two prominent $m$-complete test suite generation strategies, the Wp and HSI methods. Thus these strategies are complete for much larger fault domains than those for which they were originally designed, and thereby solve Hennie's challenge. We show that three other prominent $m$-complete methods (H, SPY and SPYH) do not always generate $k$-$A$-complete test suites.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 11 figures, to appear in proceedings CONCUR 2025</p></details> |

Yet, despite recent advances, their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}. Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle, D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically, D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-SCORE.</p></details> |  |

| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, how users perceive, evaluate, and critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with 894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies. Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes: positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g., scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained, co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis. To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Pre-trained Large Language Models for Repairing Declarative Formal Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11050v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention as a practical research domain focused on automatically fixing bugs in programs. While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptiveLLM: A Framework for Selecting Optimal Cost-Efficient LLM for Code-Generation Based on CoT Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10525v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation.

Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.

However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXPEREPAIR: Dual-Memory Enhanced LLM-based Repository-Level Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10484v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically repairing software issues remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of software engineering and AI. Although recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory. It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition, synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |

Current methods, such as instruction-enhanced reasoning and supervised fine-tuning, often result in unnecessarily long reasoning paths and face difficulties in verifying the correctness of intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose CodeTool, a novel framework for stepwise code generation that improves LLM tool invocation by leveraging the concise and easily verifiable nature of code. CodeTool incorporates two distinct process rewards: the On-the-spot Reward, which provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of each tool invocation, and the Latent Reward, which assesses the contribution of each step toward overall task completion. By maximizing the cumulative reward of the On-the-spot and Latend Rewards at each step, LLMs are guided to follow efficient and accurate reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench-TMDB demonstrate the superiority of CodeTool over existing approaches.</p></details> | ACL2025 |

As CPS grow in complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software, and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for automated and comparative evaluation. Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly compose systems or integrate components across platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed, component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and development.</p></details> |  |

However, how users perceive, evaluate, and critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with 894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies. Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes: positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g., scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained, co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis. To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Effective ML monitoring requires rich contextual information to move beyond detecting statistical shifts toward meaningful alerts and systematic root-cause analysis. Yet, surprisingly, despite extensive research in ML monitoring and related disciplines (drift detection, data validation, out-of-distribution detection), there is no shared understanding of how to use contextual information -- striking, given that monitoring involves interpretation of information in context. In response, this paper presents a systematic review to characterize and structure the various types of contextual information in this domain. Our analysis examines 94 primary studies across data mining, databases, software engineering, and ML. We introduce the Contextual System--Aspect--Representation (C-SAR) framework, a conceptual model that synthesizes our findings. We also identify 20 recurring and potentially reusable patterns of specific system, aspect, and representation combinations, and map them to the monitoring activities they support.

| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |

| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Pre-trained Large Language Models for Repairing Declarative Formal Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11050v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention as a practical research domain focused on automatically fixing bugs in programs. While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

While changed files are commonly presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100 popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for 44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order. Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests, where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than following a single predefined order.</p></details> |  |

However, the availability of hardware often lags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this, Virtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a pivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified target software. In this study, we propose an approach leveraging containerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies and enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as open-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat licenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study.

Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation.

Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.

However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXPEREPAIR: Dual-Memory Enhanced LLM-based Repository-Level Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10484v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically repairing software issues remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of software engineering and AI. Although recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory. It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition, synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Network Methods for Hub-like Microservice Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07683v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Microservice Architecture is a popular architectural paradigm that facilitates flexibility by decomposing applications into small, independently deployable services. Catalogs of architectural anti-patterns have been proposed to highlight the negative aspects of flawed microservice design. In particular, the Hub-like anti-pattern lacks an unambiguous definition and detection method. Aim: In this work, we aim to find a robust detection approach for the Hub-like microservice anti-pattern that outputs a reasonable number of Hub-like candidates with high precision. Method: We leveraged a dataset of 25 microservice networks and several network hub detection techniques to identify the Hub-like anti-pattern, namely scale-free property, centrality metrics and clustering coefficient, minimum description length principle, and the approach behind the Arcan tool. Results and Conclusion: Our findings revealed that the studied architectural networks are not scale-free, that most considered hub detection approaches do not agree on the detected hubs, and that the method by Kirkley leveraging the Erdos-Renyi encoding is the most accurate one in terms of the number of detected hubs and the detection precision. Investigating further the applicability of these methods to detecting Hub-like components in microservice-based and other systems opens up new research directions. Moreover, our results provide an evaluation of the approach utilized by the widely used Arcan tool and highlight the potential to update the tool to use the normalized degree centrality of a component in the network, or for the approach based on ER encoding to be adopted instead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |

Frequently, the systems are modelled as a network of connected services. Recently, the study of temporal networks has emerged as a way to describe and analyze evolving networks. Previous research has explored how software metrics such as size, complexity, and quality are related to microservice centrality in the architectural network. This study investigates whether temporal centrality metrics can provide insight into the early detection of architectural degradation by correlating or affecting software metrics. We reconstructed the architecture of 7 releases of an OSS microservice project with 42 services. For every service in every release, we computed the software and centrality metrics. From one of the latter, we derived a new metric, Centrality Change Proneness. We then explored the correlation between the metrics. We identified 7 size and 5 complexity metrics that have a consistent correlation with centrality, while Centrality Change Proneness did not affect the software metrics, thus providing yet another perspective and an early indicator of microservice architectural degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bug Classification in Quantum Software: A Rule-Based Framework and Its Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10397v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36 Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to 85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393 (quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696), category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162), suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects, while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and hardware-related issues.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

The automation of UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task; however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and 3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |

This study presents AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24 state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose, reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types, model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeTool: Enhancing Programmatic Tool Invocation of LLMs via Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20840v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool invocation significantly enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet challenges persist, particularly in complex task scenarios. Current methods, such as instruction-enhanced reasoning and supervised fine-tuning, often result in unnecessarily long reasoning paths and face difficulties in verifying the correctness of intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose CodeTool, a novel framework for stepwise code generation that improves LLM tool invocation by leveraging the concise and easily verifiable nature of code. CodeTool incorporates two distinct process rewards: the On-the-spot Reward, which provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of each tool invocation, and the Latent Reward, which assesses the contribution of each step toward overall task completion. By maximizing the cumulative reward of the On-the-spot and Latend Rewards at each step, LLMs are guided to follow efficient and accurate reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench-TMDB demonstrate the superiority of CodeTool over existing approaches.</p></details> | ACL2025 |
| **[Augmenting Large Language Models with Static Code Analysis for Automated Code Quality Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10330v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |
| **[ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10323v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |
| **[Minimizing False Positives in Static Bug Detection via LLM-Enhanced Path Feasibility Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10322v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality. However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning, LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% - 105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true positives.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a systematic review of software vulnerability detection (SVD) research from 2018 to 2023, offering a comprehensive taxonomy of techniques, feature representations, and embedding methods. Our analysis reveals that 91% of studies use AI-based methods, with graph-based models being the most prevalent. We identify key limitations, including dataset quality, reproducibility, and interpretability, and highlight emerging opportunities in underexplored techniques such as federated learning and quantum neural networks, providing a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |

We highlight many challenges of using Seccomp, the sandboxing designs by the participants, and what developers think would make it easier for them to sandbox applications effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Variability Effects On LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10204v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Fault Domains for Conformance Testing of Finite State Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19405v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fault domain reflects a tester's assumptions about faults that may occur in an implementation and that need to be detected during testing. A fault domain that has been widely studied in the literature on black-box conformance testing is the class of finite state machines (FSMs) with at most $m$ states. Numerous strategies for generating test suites have been proposed that guarantee fault coverage for this class. These so-called $m$-complete test suites grow exponentially in $m-n$, where $n$ is the number of states of the specification, so one can only run them for small values of $m-n$. But the assumption that $m-n$ is small is not realistic in practice. In his seminal paper from 1964, Hennie raised the challenge to design checking experiments in which the number of states may increase appreciably. In order to solve this long-standing open problem, we propose (much larger) fault domains that capture the assumption that all states in an implementation can be reached by first performing a sequence from some set $A$ (typically a state cover for the specification), followed by $k$ arbitrary inputs, for some small $k$. The number of states of FSMs in these fault domains grows exponentially in $k$. We present a sufficient condition for $k$-$A$-completeness of test suites with respect to these fault domains. Our condition implies $k$-$A$-completeness of two prominent $m$-complete test suite generation strategies, the Wp and HSI methods. Thus these strategies are complete for much larger fault domains than those for which they were originally designed, and thereby solve Hennie's challenge. We show that three other prominent $m$-complete methods (H, SPY and SPYH) do not always generate $k$-$A$-complete test suites.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 11 figures, to appear in proceedings CONCUR 2025</p></details> |
| **[D-LiFT: Improving LLM-based Decompiler Backend via Code Quality-driven Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10125v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances, their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}. Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle, D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically, D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-SCORE.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However, challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models (LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier (e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model (ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, code released here: https://github.com/SprocketLab/orm-code-verifier</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing.

However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |

We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While changed files are commonly presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100 popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for 44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order. Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests, where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than following a single predefined order.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptiveLLM: A Framework for Selecting Optimal Cost-Efficient LLM for Code-Generation Based on CoT Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10525v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation.

Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially. Our code and generated examples are open-sourced at [https://github.com/GitsSaikat/Pygen]</p></details> | 33 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Towards Understanding Bugs in Distributed Training and Inference Frameworks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10426v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However, the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs, which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging and repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLM-Based UI2Code Automation Guided by UI Layout Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10376v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task; however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and 3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AutoGEEval++: A Multi-Level and Multi-Geospatial-Modality Automated Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models in Geospatial Code Generation on Google Earth Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10365v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial code generation is becoming a key frontier in integrating artificial intelligence with geo-scientific analysis, yet standardised automated evaluation tools for this task remain absent. This study presents AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24 state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose, reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types, model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeTool: Enhancing Programmatic Tool Invocation of LLMs via Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20840v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool invocation significantly enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet challenges persist, particularly in complex task scenarios. Current methods, such as instruction-enhanced reasoning and supervised fine-tuning, often result in unnecessarily long reasoning paths and face difficulties in verifying the correctness of intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose CodeTool, a novel framework for stepwise code generation that improves LLM tool invocation by leveraging the concise and easily verifiable nature of code. CodeTool incorporates two distinct process rewards: the On-the-spot Reward, which provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of each tool invocation, and the Latent Reward, which assesses the contribution of each step toward overall task completion. By maximizing the cumulative reward of the On-the-spot and Latend Rewards at each step, LLMs are guided to follow efficient and accurate reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench-TMDB demonstrate the superiority of CodeTool over existing approaches.</p></details> | ACL2025 |
| **[Augmenting Large Language Models with Static Code Analysis for Automated Code Quality Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10330v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |
| **[ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10323v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |

This study presents a systematic review of software vulnerability detection (SVD) research from 2018 to 2023, offering a comprehensive taxonomy of techniques, feature representations, and embedding methods. Our analysis reveals that 91% of studies use AI-based methods, with graph-based models being the most prevalent. We identify key limitations, including dataset quality, reproducibility, and interpretability, and highlight emerging opportunities in underexplored techniques such as federated learning and quantum neural networks, providing a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |

| **[SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Cure: LLM-based Competitor User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15724v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[MultiCoSim: A Python-based Multi-Fidelity Co-Simulation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10869v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation is a foundational tool for the analysis and testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS), underpinning activities such as algorithm development, runtime monitoring, and system verification. As CPS grow in complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software, and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for automated and comparative evaluation. Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly compose systems or integrate components across platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed, component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Non-Code Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10833v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code understanding and generation; however, their effectiveness on non-code Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The lack of interoperability between these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SPLASH 2025</p></details> |
