| **[SweRank+: Multilingual, Multi-Turn Code Ranking for Software Issue Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20482v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining large-scale, multilingual codebases hinges on accurately localizing issues, which requires mapping natural-language error descriptions to the relevant functions that need to be modified. However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Automated In-Isolation Validation in Repository-Level Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21878v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code translation aims to migrate entire repositories across programming languages while preserving functionality automatically. Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the possible integration with other OMNeT++ libraries allows highly detailed simulations. We measure iblock's performance against a state-of-the-art blockchain simulator, proving that it is more efficient at the same level of simulation detail. We also validate iblock by using it to simulate different scenarios such as the normal Bitcoin operation and the selfish mine attack, showing that simulation results are coherent with theoretical expectations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmaries: Automatic Inference of Formal Security Summaries for Java Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20396v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a scalable, modular, and sound approach for automatically constructing formal security specifications for Java bytecode programs in the form of method summaries. A summary provides an abstract representation of a method's security behavior, consisting of the conditions under which the method can be securely invoked, together with specifications of information flows and aliasing updates. Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used. We prove the soundness of our approach in terms of guaranteeing termination-insensitive non-interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Appropriately-Sized Services with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20381v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-based architecture (SBA) has gained attention in industry and academia as a means to modernize legacy systems. It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Comprehensive Study of Bugs in Modern Distributed Deep Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20345v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In today's data-driven era, deep learning is vital for processing massive datasets, yet single-device training is constrained by computational and memory limits. Distributed deep learning overcomes these challenges by leveraging multiple GPUs or machines in parallel. While general-purpose frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch) provide distributed capabilities, these are often add-on features that demand significant manual effort for advanced parallelism, underscoring the need for specialized frameworks. This study conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of practitioner challenges in dedicated distributed frameworks. We examine 849 real-world issues from DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI and construct a taxonomy of 34 bug symptoms, 28 root causes, and 6 fix patterns. Crucially, we establish explicit mappings between symptoms, causes, and fixes across distributed training stages, enabling a systematic understanding of how issues emerge and are resolved. Our results show that 45.1\% of bug symptoms are unique to distributed frameworks, with setup failures, memory issues, and performance anomalies being the most prevalent. Moreover, 95\% of issues in the communication setup stage occur exclusively in distributed contexts. We also find over 60\% of cases can be resolved through version and dependency management, and distributed feature, API, and communication tuning. Based on these findings, we provide actionable implications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comment Traps: How Defective Commented-out Code Augment Defects in AI-Assisted Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20334v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models in code generation, AI-powered editors such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor are revolutionizing software development practices. At the same time, studies have identified potential defects in the generated code. Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate. This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags. Even with explicit instructions to ignore the defective CO code, the reduction in defects does not exceed 21.84 percent. These findings underscore the need for improved robustness and security measures in AI coding assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by FSE 2026 (ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering).

| **[Toward Explaining Large Language Models in Software Engineering Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20328v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially advanced the automation of software engineering (SE) tasks, enabling complex activities such as code generation and code summarization. However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions. Collectively, FeatureSHAP represents a meaningful step toward practical explainable AI in software engineering. FeatureSHAP is available at https://github.com/deviserlab/FeatureSHAP.</p></details> |  |

Non-targeted analysis using LC/GC-HRMS handles these cases. But when findings trigger regulatory action, reproducibility becomes operational: can an independent laboratory repeat the analysis and reach the same conclusion? We assessed 103 tools (2004-2025) against six pillars drawn from FAIR and BP4NTA principles: laboratory validation (C1), data availability (C2), code availability (C3), standardised formats (C4), knowledge integration (C5), and portable implementation (C6). Health contributed 51 tools, Pharma 31, and Chemistry 21. Nine in ten tools shared data (C2, 90/103, 87%). Fewer than four in ten supported portable implementations (C6, 40/103, 39%). Validation and portability rarely appeared together (C1+C6, 18/103, 17%). Over twenty-one years, openness climbed from 56% to 86% while operability dropped from 55% to 43%. No tool addressed food safety. Journal data-sharing policies increased what authors share but not what reviewers can run. Tools became easier to find but harder to execute. Strengthening C1, C4, and C6 would turn documented artifacts into workflows that external laboratories can replay.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Journal of Cheminformatics</p></details> |

However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the possible integration with other OMNeT++ libraries allows highly detailed simulations. We measure iblock's performance against a state-of-the-art blockchain simulator, proving that it is more efficient at the same level of simulation detail.

A summary provides an abstract representation of a method's security behavior, consisting of the conditions under which the method can be securely invoked, together with specifications of information flows and aliasing updates. Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used. We prove the soundness of our approach in terms of guaranteeing termination-insensitive non-interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Appropriately-Sized Services with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20381v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-based architecture (SBA) has gained attention in industry and academia as a means to modernize legacy systems. It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

Distributed deep learning overcomes these challenges by leveraging multiple GPUs or machines in parallel. While general-purpose frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch) provide distributed capabilities, these are often add-on features that demand significant manual effort for advanced parallelism, underscoring the need for specialized frameworks. This study conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of practitioner challenges in dedicated distributed frameworks. We examine 849 real-world issues from DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI and construct a taxonomy of 34 bug symptoms, 28 root causes, and 6 fix patterns. Crucially, we establish explicit mappings between symptoms, causes, and fixes across distributed training stages, enabling a systematic understanding of how issues emerge and are resolved. Our results show that 45.1\% of bug symptoms are unique to distributed frameworks, with setup failures, memory issues, and performance anomalies being the most prevalent. Moreover, 95\% of issues in the communication setup stage occur exclusively in distributed contexts. We also find over 60\% of cases can be resolved through version and dependency management, and distributed feature, API, and communication tuning. Based on these findings, we provide actionable implications.</p></details> |  |

A summary provides an abstract representation of a method's security behavior, consisting of the conditions under which the method can be securely invoked, together with specifications of information flows and aliasing updates. Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used. We prove the soundness of our approach in terms of guaranteeing termination-insensitive non-interference.</p></details> |  |

It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts.

Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment.

However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks.

However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation.</p></details> |  |

We measure iblock's performance against a state-of-the-art blockchain simulator, proving that it is more efficient at the same level of simulation detail.

A summary provides an abstract representation of a method's security behavior, consisting of the conditions under which the method can be securely invoked, together with specifications of information flows and aliasing updates. Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used. We prove the soundness of our approach in terms of guaranteeing termination-insensitive non-interference.</p></details> |  |

It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

Distributed deep learning overcomes these challenges by leveraging multiple GPUs or machines in parallel. While general-purpose frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch) provide distributed capabilities, these are often add-on features that demand significant manual effort for advanced parallelism, underscoring the need for specialized frameworks. This study conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of practitioner challenges in dedicated distributed frameworks. We examine 849 real-world issues from DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI and construct a taxonomy of 34 bug symptoms, 28 root causes, and 6 fix patterns. Crucially, we establish explicit mappings between symptoms, causes, and fixes across distributed training stages, enabling a systematic understanding of how issues emerge and are resolved. Our results show that 45.1\% of bug symptoms are unique to distributed frameworks, with setup failures, memory issues, and performance anomalies being the most prevalent. Moreover, 95\% of issues in the communication setup stage occur exclusively in distributed contexts. We also find over 60\% of cases can be resolved through version and dependency management, and distributed feature, API, and communication tuning. Based on these findings, we provide actionable implications.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, studies have identified potential defects in the generated code. Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate. This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags. Even with explicit instructions to ignore the defective CO code, the reduction in defects does not exceed 21.84 percent. These findings underscore the need for improved robustness and security measures in AI coding assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by FSE 2026 (ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering).

| **[Toward Explaining Large Language Models in Software Engineering Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20328v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially advanced the automation of software engineering (SE) tasks, enabling complex activities such as code generation and code summarization. However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions. Collectively, FeatureSHAP represents a meaningful step toward practical explainable AI in software engineering.

We examine 849 real-world issues from DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI and construct a taxonomy of 34 bug symptoms, 28 root causes, and 6 fix patterns. Crucially, we establish explicit mappings between symptoms, causes, and fixes across distributed training stages, enabling a systematic understanding of how issues emerge and are resolved. Our results show that 45.1\% of bug symptoms are unique to distributed frameworks, with setup failures, memory issues, and performance anomalies being the most prevalent. Moreover, 95\% of issues in the communication setup stage occur exclusively in distributed contexts. We also find over 60\% of cases can be resolved through version and dependency management, and distributed feature, API, and communication tuning.

Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions.

However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Automated In-Isolation Validation in Repository-Level Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21878v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code translation aims to migrate entire repositories across programming languages while preserving functionality automatically. Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the possible integration with other OMNeT++ libraries allows highly detailed simulations. We measure iblock's performance against a state-of-the-art blockchain simulator, proving that it is more efficient at the same level of simulation detail. We also validate iblock by using it to simulate different scenarios such as the normal Bitcoin operation and the selfish mine attack, showing that simulation results are coherent with theoretical expectations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmaries: Automatic Inference of Formal Security Summaries for Java Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20396v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a scalable, modular, and sound approach for automatically constructing formal security specifications for Java bytecode programs in the form of method summaries. A summary provides an abstract representation of a method's security behavior, consisting of the conditions under which the method can be securely invoked, together with specifications of information flows and aliasing updates. Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used. We prove the soundness of our approach in terms of guaranteeing termination-insensitive non-interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Appropriately-Sized Services with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20381v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-based architecture (SBA) has gained attention in industry and academia as a means to modernize legacy systems. It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
