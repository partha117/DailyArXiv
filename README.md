| **[When Agents Fail: A Comprehensive Study of Bugs in LLM Agents with Automated Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15232v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent application development. While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this paper has been submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |
| **[Where Do AI Coding Agents Fail? An Empirical Study of Failed Agentic Pull Requests in GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15195v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for ABAP Code Generation: An Empirical Study on Iterative Improvement by Compiler Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15188v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating ABAP code. Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Author: Hartmut Westenberger (ORCID: 0009-0009-9063-8318)</p></details> |
| **[HD-GEN: A High-Performance Software System for Human Mobility Data Generation Based on Patterns of Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01219v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding individual-level human mobility is critical for a wide range of applications. As such, real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors and patterns of life but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offers scalability and flexibility but frequently lacks realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for, generating, calibrating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine which constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module that fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite which transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking, and (4) a visualization module that extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGA: Detecting Security Vulnerabilities Using Static Aspect Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15154v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages; as such, projects written in Python involve an increasing number of diverse security vulnerabilities. However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects. In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties. We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools. This analysis was performed in less than 31 seconds, i.e., between 2.5 and 512.1 times faster than the baseline tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 3-page appendix, 23 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[From Charts to Code: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17932v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Authors and Maintainers Link (or Don't Link) Their PyPI Libraries to Code Repositories and Donation Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15139v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metadata of libraries on the Python Package Index (PyPI)-including links to source code repositories and donation platforms-plays a critical role in supporting the transparency, trust, and sustainability of open-source libraries. Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning in Code-Related Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15094v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven highly effective in automating software engineering tasks, bridging natural language and code semantics to achieve notable results in code generation and summarization. However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeLog: An Efficient Log Compression Framework with Pattern Signature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15084v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parser-based log compression, which separates static tem- plates from dynamic variables, is a promising approach to exploit the unique structure of log data. However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio? To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups. Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[SmartOracle -- An Agentic Approach to Mitigate Noise in Differential Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15074v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential fuzzers detect bugs by executing identical inputs across distinct implementations of the same specification, such as JavaScript interpreters. Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated. Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict. For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS. The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default, without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default, including versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs, and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models, metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization workflows, supporting location-based services, in particular. In this paper, we introduce a low-code, configuration-first framework in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. We instantiate the framework as LOCALIZE with preconfigured, versioned datasets that reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a example dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Practical Guide to Establishing Technical Debt Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11430v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This white paper provides an overview of the topic of "technical debt" and presents an approach for managing technical debt in teams. The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet-Adaptation for Diffusion-Based Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15041v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.</p></details> |  |

Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated. Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict. For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS. The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default, without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default, including versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs, and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models, metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization workflows, supporting location-based services, in particular. In this paper, we introduce a low-code, configuration-first framework in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. We instantiate the framework as LOCALIZE with preconfigured, versioned datasets that reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a example dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet-Adaptation for Diffusion-Based Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15041v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.</p></details> |  |

While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this paper has been submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

An Empirical Study of Failed Agentic Pull Requests in GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15195v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)</p></details> |

Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Author: Hartmut Westenberger (ORCID: 0009-0009-9063-8318)</p></details> |
| **[HD-GEN: A High-Performance Software System for Human Mobility Data Generation Based on Patterns of Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01219v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding individual-level human mobility is critical for a wide range of applications. As such, real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors and patterns of life but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offers scalability and flexibility but frequently lacks realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for, generating, calibrating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine which constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module that fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite which transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking, and (4) a visualization module that extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects. In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties. We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools. This analysis was performed in less than 31 seconds, i.e., between 2.5 and 512.1 times faster than the baseline tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 3-page appendix, 23 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[From Charts to Code: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17932v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |

Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning in Code-Related Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15094v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven highly effective in automating software engineering tasks, bridging natural language and code semantics to achieve notable results in code generation and summarization. However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.</p></details> |  |

However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio? To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups.

| **[From Charts to Code: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17932v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |

Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning in Code-Related Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15094v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven highly effective in automating software engineering tasks, bridging natural language and code semantics to achieve notable results in code generation and summarization. However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeLog: An Efficient Log Compression Framework with Pattern Signature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15084v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parser-based log compression, which separates static tem- plates from dynamic variables, is a promising approach to exploit the unique structure of log data. However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio? To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups. Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated. Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict. For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS. The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default, without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default, including versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs, and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models, metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization workflows, supporting location-based services, in particular. In this paper, we introduce a low-code, configuration-first framework in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. We instantiate the framework as LOCALIZE with preconfigured, versioned datasets that reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a example dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet-Adaptation for Diffusion-Based Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15041v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.</p></details> |  |

While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this paper has been submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

An Empirical Study of Failed Agentic Pull Requests in GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15195v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)</p></details> |

Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Author: Hartmut Westenberger (ORCID: 0009-0009-9063-8318)</p></details> |

As such, real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors and patterns of life but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offers scalability and flexibility but frequently lacks realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for, generating, calibrating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine which constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module that fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite which transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking, and (4) a visualization module that extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects. In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties. We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools. This analysis was performed in less than 31 seconds, i.e., between 2.5 and 512.1 times faster than the baseline tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 3-page appendix, 23 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |

For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this paper has been submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |
| **[Where Do AI Coding Agents Fail? An Empirical Study of Failed Agentic Pull Requests in GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15195v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for ABAP Code Generation: An Empirical Study on Iterative Improvement by Compiler Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15188v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating ABAP code. Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Author: Hartmut Westenberger (ORCID: 0009-0009-9063-8318)</p></details> |
| **[HD-GEN: A High-Performance Software System for Human Mobility Data Generation Based on Patterns of Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01219v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding individual-level human mobility is critical for a wide range of applications. As such, real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors and patterns of life but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offers scalability and flexibility but frequently lacks realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for, generating, calibrating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine which constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module that fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite which transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking, and (4) a visualization module that extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGA: Detecting Security Vulnerabilities Using Static Aspect Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15154v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages; as such, projects written in Python involve an increasing number of diverse security vulnerabilities. However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects. In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties. We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools. This analysis was performed in less than 31 seconds, i.e., between 2.5 and 512.1 times faster than the baseline tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 3-page appendix, 23 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[From Charts to Code: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17932v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |

Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning in Code-Related Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15094v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven highly effective in automating software engineering tasks, bridging natural language and code semantics to achieve notable results in code generation and summarization. However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeLog: An Efficient Log Compression Framework with Pattern Signature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15084v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parser-based log compression, which separates static tem- plates from dynamic variables, is a promising approach to exploit the unique structure of log data. However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio? To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups. Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[SmartOracle -- An Agentic Approach to Mitigate Noise in Differential Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15074v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential fuzzers detect bugs by executing identical inputs across distinct implementations of the same specification, such as JavaScript interpreters. Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated. Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict. For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS. The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default, without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default, including versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs, and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models, metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization workflows, supporting location-based services, in particular. In this paper, we introduce a low-code, configuration-first framework in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. We instantiate the framework as LOCALIZE with preconfigured, versioned datasets that reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a example dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Practical Guide to Establishing Technical Debt Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11430v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This white paper provides an overview of the topic of "technical debt" and presents an approach for managing technical debt in teams. The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet-Adaptation for Diffusion-Based Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15041v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.</p></details> |  |

While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset.

In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS. The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default, without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default, including versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs, and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models, metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization workflows, supporting location-based services, in particular. In this paper, we introduce a low-code, configuration-first framework in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. We instantiate the framework as LOCALIZE with preconfigured, versioned datasets that reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a example dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet-Adaptation for Diffusion-Based Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15041v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.</p></details> |  |

While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this paper has been submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

An Empirical Study of Failed Agentic Pull Requests in GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15195v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)</p></details> |

Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Author: Hartmut Westenberger (ORCID: 0009-0009-9063-8318)</p></details> |
| **[HD-GEN: A High-Performance Software System for Human Mobility Data Generation Based on Patterns of Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01219v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding individual-level human mobility is critical for a wide range of applications. As such, real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors and patterns of life but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offers scalability and flexibility but frequently lacks realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for, generating, calibrating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine which constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module that fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite which transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking, and (4) a visualization module that extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGA: Detecting Security Vulnerabilities Using Static Aspect Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15154v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages; as such, projects written in Python involve an increasing number of diverse security vulnerabilities. However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects. In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties. We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools. This analysis was performed in less than 31 seconds, i.e., between 2.5 and 512.1 times faster than the baseline tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 3-page appendix, 23 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[From Charts to Code: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17932v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |

Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning in Code-Related Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15094v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven highly effective in automating software engineering tasks, bridging natural language and code semantics to achieve notable results in code generation and summarization. However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeLog: An Efficient Log Compression Framework with Pattern Signature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15084v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parser-based log compression, which separates static tem- plates from dynamic variables, is a promising approach to exploit the unique structure of log data. However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio? To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups. Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated. Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict. For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS. The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</p></details> |  |

Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |

Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.</p></details> |  |

However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio? To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups. Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated. Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict. For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS. The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default, without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default, including versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs, and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models, metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization workflows, supporting location-based services, in particular. In this paper, we introduce a low-code, configuration-first framework in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. We instantiate the framework as LOCALIZE with preconfigured, versioned datasets that reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a example dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet-Adaptation for Diffusion-Based Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15041v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.</p></details> |  |

While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this paper has been submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

An Empirical Study of Failed Agentic Pull Requests in GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15195v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)</p></details> |

Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Author: Hartmut Westenberger (ORCID: 0009-0009-9063-8318)</p></details> |

As such, real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors and patterns of life but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offers scalability and flexibility but frequently lacks realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for, generating, calibrating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine which constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module that fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite which transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking, and (4) a visualization module that extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects. In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties. We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools. This analysis was performed in less than 31 seconds, i.e., between 2.5 and 512.1 times faster than the baseline tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 3-page appendix, 23 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |

Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |

Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for ABAP Code Generation: An Empirical Study on Iterative Improvement by Compiler Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15188v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating ABAP code. Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Author: Hartmut Westenberger (ORCID: 0009-0009-9063-8318)</p></details> |
| **[HD-GEN: A High-Performance Software System for Human Mobility Data Generation Based on Patterns of Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01219v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding individual-level human mobility is critical for a wide range of applications. As such, real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors and patterns of life but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offers scalability and flexibility but frequently lacks realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for, generating, calibrating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine which constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module that fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite which transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking, and (4) a visualization module that extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGA: Detecting Security Vulnerabilities Using Static Aspect Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15154v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages; as such, projects written in Python involve an increasing number of diverse security vulnerabilities. However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects. In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties. We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools. This analysis was performed in less than 31 seconds, i.e., between 2.5 and 512.1 times faster than the baseline tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 3-page appendix, 23 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[From Charts to Code: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17932v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |

Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning in Code-Related Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15094v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven highly effective in automating software engineering tasks, bridging natural language and code semantics to achieve notable results in code generation and summarization. However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeLog: An Efficient Log Compression Framework with Pattern Signature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15084v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parser-based log compression, which separates static tem- plates from dynamic variables, is a promising approach to exploit the unique structure of log data. However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio? To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups. Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[SmartOracle -- An Agentic Approach to Mitigate Noise in Differential Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15074v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential fuzzers detect bugs by executing identical inputs across distinct implementations of the same specification, such as JavaScript interpreters. Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated. Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict. For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS. The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default, without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default, including versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs, and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models, metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization workflows, supporting location-based services, in particular. In this paper, we introduce a low-code, configuration-first framework in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. We instantiate the framework as LOCALIZE with preconfigured, versioned datasets that reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a example dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet-Adaptation for Diffusion-Based Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15041v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.</p></details> |  |

While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this paper has been submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a low-code, configuration-first framework in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. We instantiate the framework as LOCALIZE with preconfigured, versioned datasets that reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a example dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Practical Guide to Establishing Technical Debt Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11430v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This white paper provides an overview of the topic of "technical debt" and presents an approach for managing technical debt in teams. The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet-Adaptation for Diffusion-Based Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15041v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.</p></details> |  |

| **[When Agents Fail: A Comprehensive Study of Bugs in LLM Agents with Automated Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15232v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent application development. While standalone LLMs cannot perform any actions, LLM agents address the limitation by integrating tools. However, debugging LLM agents is difficult and costly as the field is still in it's early stage and the community is underdeveloped. To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations. For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this paper has been submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |
| **[Where Do AI Coding Agents Fail? An Empirical Study of Failed Agentic Pull Requests in GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15195v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for ABAP Code Generation: An Empirical Study on Iterative Improvement by Compiler Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15188v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating ABAP code. Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, Author: Hartmut Westenberger (ORCID: 0009-0009-9063-8318)</p></details> |
| **[HD-GEN: A High-Performance Software System for Human Mobility Data Generation Based on Patterns of Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01219v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding individual-level human mobility is critical for a wide range of applications. As such, real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors and patterns of life but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offers scalability and flexibility but frequently lacks realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for, generating, calibrating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine which constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module that fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite which transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking, and (4) a visualization module that extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGA: Detecting Security Vulnerabilities Using Static Aspect Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15154v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages; as such, projects written in Python involve an increasing number of diverse security vulnerabilities. However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects. In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties. We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools. This analysis was performed in less than 31 seconds, i.e., between 2.5 and 512.1 times faster than the baseline tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 3-page appendix, 23 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[From Charts to Code: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17932v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Authors and Maintainers Link (or Don't Link) Their PyPI Libraries to Code Repositories and Donation Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15139v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metadata of libraries on the Python Package Index (PyPI)-including links to source code repositories and donation platforms-plays a critical role in supporting the transparency, trust, and sustainability of open-source libraries. Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning in Code-Related Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15094v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven highly effective in automating software engineering tasks, bridging natural language and code semantics to achieve notable results in code generation and summarization. However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeLog: An Efficient Log Compression Framework with Pattern Signature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15084v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parser-based log compression, which separates static tem- plates from dynamic variables, is a promising approach to exploit the unique structure of log data. However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio? To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups. Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[SmartOracle -- An Agentic Approach to Mitigate Noise in Differential Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15074v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential fuzzers detect bugs by executing identical inputs across distinct implementations of the same specification, such as JavaScript interpreters. Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated. Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict. For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\times$ and API costs by 10$\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS. The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work.</p></details> |  |
