Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub(https://github.com/trishullab/clever) as well as HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever).

| **[Exploring Large Language Models for Access Control Policy Synthesis and Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20692v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies, they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Soundness and Precision Benchmark for Java Debloating Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20679v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software development reuses code by importing libraries as dependencies. Software projects typically include an average of 36 dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off, we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs. JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and reliable debloated software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - accepted at the ACM Workshop on Software Supply Chain Offensive Research and Ecosystem Defenses (SCORED '25)</p></details> |
| **[Lessons Learned: A Multi-Agent Framework for Code LLMs to Learn and Improve](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23946v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Large Language Models for Fault Localization: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20521v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks, but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

| **[Fine-Tuning Multilingual Language Models for Code Review: An Empirical Study on Industrial C# Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19271v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but often time-consuming and cognitively demanding, especially in industrial environments. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation, Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs for automated code review.</p></details> |  |

| **[FidelityGPT: Correcting Decompilation Distortions with Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19615v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompilation converts machine code into human-readable form, enabling analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89% and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%, Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review on Large Language Models for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01466v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to patch software bugs and reduce manual debugging efforts. Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |
| **[InspectCoder: Dynamic Analysis-Enabled Self Repair through interactive LLM-Debugger Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18327v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhyFlow: Interrogative Debugger for Sensemaking Taint Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |

Yet few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, potentially due to the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench has 111 curated and reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific out-of-order execution issue. To support reproducibility and ease of use, JunoBench offers a unified execution environment where crashes and fixes can be reliably reproduced. By providing realistic crashes and their resolutions, JunoBench facilitates bug detection, localization, and repair tailored to the interactive and iterative nature of notebook-based ML development.</p></details> |  |

It showcases modern features, including per-app address spaces, threading, commodity filesystems, USB, DMA, multicore support, self-hosted debugging, and a window manager. It supports rich applications such as 2D/3D games, music and video players, and a blockchain miner. Unlike traditional instructional systems, Proto emphasizes engaging, media-rich apps that go beyond basic terminal programs. Our method breaks down a full-featured OS into a set of incremental, self-contained prototypes. Each prototype introduces a minimal set of OS mechanisms, driven by the needs of specific apps. The construction process then progressively enables these apps by bringing up one mechanism at a time. Proto enables a wider audience to experience building a self-contained software system used in daily life</p></details> | 17 pages, SOSP'25 |

Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Final Code: A Process-Oriented Error Analysis of Software Development Agents in Real-World GitHub Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICSE 2026, Research Track</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Study of Time Limit Exceeded Errors in Online Programming Assignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14339v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online programming platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode attract millions of users seeking to learn to program or refine their skills for industry interviews. A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon their submissions after repeated TLE failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely performance issues. Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same 1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.</p></details> |  |

Automated repair of such failures is promising, but existing techniques rely on test cases, which are not available for non-compilable code. We employ an automated repair approach for compilation errors driven by large language models (LLMs). Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000 commits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours typically required for manual debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference: 2025 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)</p></details> |
| **[Can ChatGPT support software verification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 2024</p></details> |
| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69 AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95% CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90% relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1 inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus 28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%) occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points; arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven, provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis with end-to-end auditability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, link to code repo</p></details> |
| **[On Developers' Self-Declaration of AI-Generated Code: An Analysis of Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16485v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers, who use them to assist in software development due to their capability to generate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

However, the reality of video games require its own set of unique debugging techniques such as On-Screen Console, Debug Draws, Debug Camera, Cheats and In-Game Menus, and Data Scrubbing. In this article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, gas 2026 conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |

We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite their importance, no existing evaluation benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework, HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting in Practice: Investigating Software Developers' Use of Generative AI Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06000v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has fundamentally transformed software development. Although prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill, existing research focuses primarily on individual techniques rather than software developers' broader workflows. This study presents a systematic investigation of how software engineers integrate GenAI tools into their professional practice through a large-scale survey examining prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across various software engineering tasks. We surveyed 91 software engineers, including 72 active GenAI users, to understand AI usage patterns throughout the development process. Our 14 key findings show that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency strongly correlates with using AI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and code review, and that developers prefer iterative multi-turn conversations to single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable, while complex code generation and debugging present sizable challenges. Our insights provide an empirical baseline of current developer practices, from simple code generation to deeper workflow integration, with actionable insights for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[RedCodeAgent: Automatic Red-teaming Agent against Diverse Code Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02609v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.</p></details> |  |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging approach should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with the tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |

Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap, this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity. Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes. Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts. Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences, necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |

Vibe coding is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code. Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101 practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools' outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers, particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping, but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.</p></details> |  |

We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJjFfnxUx0.</p></details> |  |
| **[TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.</p></details> |  |

Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress (V2)</p></details> |

LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence-Guided Concolic Testing of Transformer Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23806v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an {influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible, pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring, compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that (i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration, and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering potential utility for debugging and model auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Specific Instruction: A Longitudinal Study on Debugging Skill Acquisition and Retention for Novice Programmers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22420v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localization is a critical skill, yet novices often lack systematic approaches. Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps; the impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week longitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract guidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that pairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4). Forty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5). Each session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element containing a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to completion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and strategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to completion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other groups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p < 0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other groups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses showed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants internalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that context-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger retention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions produced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized performance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may bridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more equitable path for novices.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (25 pages for the paper, rest pages are references and appendix). 4 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[SecureAgentBench: Benchmarking Secure Code Generation under Realistic Vulnerability Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22097v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents (SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions, (ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step toward more reliable software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |

Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Co-evolutionary Metamorphic Differential Testing for Autonomous Systems with an Interpretability Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16478v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, such as autonomous driving systems, evolve rapidly through frequent updates, risking unintended behavioral degradations. Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment. CoCoMagic offers an efficient, effective, and interpretable way for the differential testing of evolving autonomous systems across versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous systems, giving rise to a new class of software known as Agentware, where LLM-powered agents perform complex, open-ended tasks in domains such as software engineering, customer service, and data analysis. However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |

Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |

A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rethinking Technology Stack Selection with AI Coding Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11132v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now an integral part of software development workflows and are reshaping the whole process. Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[ViScratch: Using Large Language Models and Gameplay Videos for Automated Feedback in Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11065v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based programming environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in programming education, in particular for young learners. While the use of blocks helps prevent syntax errors, semantic bugs remain common and difficult to debug. Existing tools for Scratch debugging rely heavily on predefined rules or user manual inputs, and crucially, they ignore the platform's inherently visual nature. We introduce ViScratch, the first multimodal feedback generation system for Scratch that leverages both the project's block code and its generated gameplay video to diagnose and repair bugs. ViScratch uses a two-stage pipeline: a vision-language model first aligns visual symptoms with code structure to identify a single critical issue, then proposes minimal, abstract syntax tree level repairs that are verified via execution in the Scratch virtual machine. We evaluate ViScratch on a set of real-world Scratch projects against state-of-the-art LLM-based tools and human testers. Results show that gameplay video is a crucial debugging signal: ViScratch substantially outperforms prior tools in both bug identification and repair quality, even without access to project descriptions or goals. This work demonstrates that video can serve as a first-class specification in visual programming environments, opening new directions for LLM-based debugging beyond symbolic code alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Testing and Adapting REST APIs as LLM Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15546v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build autonomous agents that perform complex tasks with external tools, often exposed through APIs in enterprise systems. Direct use of these APIs is difficult due to the complex input schema and verbose responses. Current benchmarks overlook these challenges, leaving a gap in assessing API readiness for agent-driven automation. We present a testing framework that systematically evaluates enterprise APIs when wrapped as Python tools for LLM-based agents. The framework generates data-aware test cases, translates them into natural language instructions, and evaluates whether agents can correctly invoke the tool, handle their inputs, and process its responses. We apply the framework to generate over 2400 test cases across different domains and develop a taxonomy of common errors, including input misinterpretation, output failures, and schema mismatches. We further classify errors to support debugging and tool refinement. Our framework provides a systematic approach to enabling enterprise APIs as reliable tools for agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aspect-Oriented Programming in Secure Software Development: A Case Study of Security Aspects in Web Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07449v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security remains a critical challenge in modern web applications, where threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks continue to undermine trust and reliability. Traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality, leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging, and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches. Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code, coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators. Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers seeking to balance security with software quality in web application development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Challenging Bug Prediction and Repair Models with Synthetic Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02407v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs are essential in software engineering; many research studies in the past decades have been proposed to detect, localize, and repair bugs in software systems. Effectiveness evaluation of such techniques requires complex bugs, i.e., those that are hard to detect through testing and hard to repair through debugging. From the classic software engineering point of view, a hard-to-repair bug differs from the correct code in multiple locations, making it hard to localize and repair. Hard-to-detect bugs, on the other hand, manifest themselves under specific test inputs and reachability conditions. These two objectives, i.e., generating hard-to-detect and hard-to-repair bugs, are mostly aligned; a bug generation technique can change multiple statements to be covered only under a specific set of inputs. However, these two objectives are conflicting for learning-based techniques: A bug should have a similar code representation to the correct code in the training data to challenge a bug prediction model to distinguish them. The hard-to-repair bug definition remains the same but with a caveat: the more a bug differs from the original code, the more distant their representations are and easier to be detected. We propose BugFarm, to transform arbitrary code into multiple complex bugs. BugFarm leverages LLMs to mutate code in multiple locations (hard-to-repair). To ensure that multiple modifications do not notably change the code representation, BugFarm analyzes the attention of the underlying model and instructs LLMs to only change the least attended locations (hard-to-detect). Our comprehensive evaluation of 435k+ bugs from over 1.9M mutants generated by BUGFARM and two alternative approaches demonstrates our superiority in generating bugs that are hard to detect by learning-based bug prediction approaches and hard-to-repair by state-of-the-art learning-based program repair technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in SCAM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and repairing faults when programs fail to formally verify can be complex and time-consuming. Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIO: Multiverse Debugging in the Face of Input/Output -- Extended Version with Additional Appendices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06845v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution paths within the state space. Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e. states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse, may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is caused by the debugger. This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during regular execution. We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our techniques. As a demonstration of the approach we highlight a color dial built with a Lego Mindstorms motor, and color sensor, providing a tangible example of how our approach enables multiverse debugging for programs running on an STM32 microcontroller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This extended version provides auxiliary material to the article of the same title that will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the PACMPL issue for OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging. While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22 subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs, where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well in repository-level debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures, EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |

Their adoption requires systematic investigation to ensure responsible integration into curricula. Objective: This doctoral research aims to develop a validated framework for integrating LLMs into SE education through a multi-phase process, including taxonomies development, empirical investigation, and case studies. This paper presents the first empirical step. Method: We conducted a pilot repository mining study of 400 GitHub projects, analyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of motivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8] study. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits), software engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming assistance and debugging support (97 hits) were strongly represented. Demotivators, including plagiarism and IP concerns (385 hits), security, privacy and data integrity (87 hits), and over-reliance on AI in learning (39 hits), also appeared prominently. In contrast, demotivators such as challenges in evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded no hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical validation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes, highlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a comprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE education.</p></details> |  |

While classical software engineering has evolved with various tools and methodologies to tackle such bugs, the emergence of quantum computing presents unique challenges. Quantum software development introduces complexities due to the probabilistic nature of quantum computing, distinct algorithmic primitives, and potential hardware noise. In this paper, we introduce CircInspect, an interactive tool tailored for debugging quantum programs in Python and PennyLane.

| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the dynamic data dependency of a step that reads a variable $v$ is challenging. It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An experience-based classification of quantum bugs in quantum software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03280v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However, the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong, which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that - unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic quantum debugging strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access, Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |

We present a framework that integrates spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT. This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.</p></details> |  |

| **[Which Is Better For Reducing Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Pinning or Floating?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08609v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning} as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common. We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable dependencies.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE 2025 |
| **[Large Language Models for Fault Localization: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20521v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks, but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[On Interaction Effects in Greybox Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19984v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A greybox fuzzer is an automated software testing tool that generates new test inputs by applying randomly chosen mutators (e.g., flipping a bit or deleting a block of bytes) to a seed input in random order and adds all coverage-increasing inputs to the corpus of seeds. We hypothesize that the order in which mutators are applied to a seed input has an impact on the effectiveness of greybox fuzzers. In our experiments, we fit a linear model to a dataset that contains the effectiveness of all possible mutator pairs and indeed observe the conjectured interaction effect. This points us to more efficient fuzzing by choosing the most promising mutator sequence with a higher likelihood. We propose MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that learns and chooses the most promising mutator sequences. MuoFuzz learns the conditional probability that the next mutator will yield an interesting input, given the previously selected mutator. Then, it samples from the learned probability using a random walk to generate mutator sequences. We compare the performance of MuoFuzz to AFL++, which uses a fixed selection probability, and MOPT, which optimizes the selection probability of each mutator in isolation. Experimental results on the FuzzBench and MAGMA benchmarks show that MuoFuzz achieves the highest code coverage and finds four bugs missed by AFL++ and one missed by both AFL++ and MOPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, Accepted for presentation at the 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '26)</p></details> |

We introduce a novel method for synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning, outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over three seeds.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Goal-Driven Survey on Root Cause Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19593v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a crucial aspect of incident management in large-scale cloud services. While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been widely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because the term "RCA" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For instance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is fundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a definitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these goal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types (e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of works with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps in the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen who want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who want to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA survey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high demand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that effectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of cloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period from 2014 to 2025. In addition to the goal-driven categorization, it discusses the ultimate goal of all RCA papers as an umbrella covering different RCA formulations. Moreover, the paper discusses open challenges and future directions in RCA.</p></details> |  |

While Metamorphic Testing (MT) is effective for fault detection in ADS, existing methods rely heavily on manual effort and lack automation. We present AutoMT, a multi-agent MT framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that automates the extraction of Metamorphic Relations (MRs) from local traffic rules and the generation of valid follow-up test cases. AutoMT leverages LLMs to extract MRs from traffic rules in Gherkin syntax using a predefined ontology. A vision-language agent analyzes scenarios, and a search agent retrieves suitable MRs from a RAG-based database to generate follow-up cases via computer vision. Experiments show that AutoMT achieves up to 5 x higher test diversity in follow-up case generation compared to the best baseline (manual expert-defined MRs) in terms of validation rate, and detects up to 20.55% more behavioral violations. While manual MT relies on a fixed set of predefined rules, AutoMT automatically extracts diverse metamorphic relations that augment real-world datasets and help uncover corner cases often missed during in-field testing and data collection. Its modular architecture separating MR extraction, filtering, and test generation supports integration into industrial pipelines and potentially enables simulation-based testing to systematically cover underrepresented or safety-critical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrioXpert: An Automated Incident Management Framework for Microservice System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10043v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated incident management plays a pivotal role in large-scale microservice systems. However, many existing methods rely solely on single-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to simultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection (AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the lack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to insufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose TrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully leveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing pipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities, comprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems from both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative reasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle multiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong interpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two microservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that TrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%), FT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks. TrioXpert has also been deployed in Lenovo's production environment, demonstrating substantial gains in diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This research was conducted with the aim of designing and implementing an integrated and reproducible infrastructure for the development, building, and testing of a Linux-based operating system using the Yocto Project. The proposed structure was implemented based on a three-layer architecture consisting of the main Yocto repositories, a custom layer (meta-custom), and a coordinating manifest layer to ensure version synchronization, scalability, and reproducibility. Three sample projects, including libhelloworld, helloworld, and the kernel module hello mod, were developed and integrated into the build process. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines were implemented with GitLab CI and combined with an isolated Docker environment to automate and streamline the build and testing workflows. Using a local cache server containing hashserv, downloads and sstate cache significantly reduced the build time. The functionality and stability of the system were verified through six boot test scenarios in the QEMU simulator. The results show that the proposed design not only ensures reproducibility but also can be extended to advanced applications such as continuous deployment of real-time Linux versions. Future recommendations include expanding automated tests, implementing system monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, using distributed builds, optimizing with Docker multi-stage builds, and enabling continuous deployment of real-time Linux changes to provide a stable and scalable model for industrial and research projects in embedded systems with a rapid and reliable development cycle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20749v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60 ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of 0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLEVER: A Curated Benchmark for Formally Verified Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13938v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$, a high-quality, curated benchmark of 161 problems for end-to-end verified code generation in Lean. Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub(https://github.com/trishullab/clever) as well as HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever). All our evaluation code is also available online(https://github.com/trishullab/clever-prover).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Soundness and Precision Benchmark for Java Debloating Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20679v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software development reuses code by importing libraries as dependencies. Software projects typically include an average of 36 dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off, we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs. JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and reliable debloated software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - accepted at the ACM Workshop on Software Supply Chain Offensive Research and Ecosystem Defenses (SCORED '25)</p></details> |
| **[Which Is Better For Reducing Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Pinning or Floating?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08609v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning} as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common. We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable dependencies.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE 2025 |
| **[Large Language Models for Fault Localization: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20521v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks, but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation, Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs for automated code review.</p></details> |  |

Yet, Java has no support for it. We solve this problem with Classport, a system that embeds dependency information into Java class files, enabling the retrieval of dependency information at runtime. We evaluate Classport on six real-world projects, demonstrating the feasibility in identifying dependencies at runtime. Runtime dependency introspection with Classport opens important avenues for runtime integrity checking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Efficient and Permissive Programmatic Runtime Shields for Neural Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05641v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing use of neural policies in control systems, ensuring their safety and reliability has become a critical software engineering task. One prevalent approach to ensuring the safety of neural policies is to deploy programmatic runtime shields alongside them to correct their unsafe commands. However, the programmatic runtime shields synthesized by existing methods are either computationally expensive or insufficiently permissive, resulting in high overhead and unnecessary interventions on the system. To address these challenges, we propose Aegis, a novel framework that synthesizes lightweight and permissive programmatic runtime shields for neural policies. Aegis achieves this by formulating the seeking of a runtime shield as a sketch-based program synthesis problem and proposing a novel method that leverages counterexample-guided inductive synthesis and Bayesian optimization to solve it. To evaluate Aegis and its synthesized shields, we use eight representative control systems and compare Aegis with the current state-of-the-art. Our results show that the programmatic runtime shields synthesized by Aegis can correct all unsafe commands from neural policies, ensuring that the systems do not violate any desired safety properties at all times. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, Aegis's shields exhibit a 2.2$\times$ reduction in time overhead and a 3.9$\times$ reduction in memory usage, suggesting that they are much more lightweight. Moreover, Aegis's shields incur an average of 1.5$\times$ fewer interventions than other shields, showing better permissiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 39 pages</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Benchmarks and Solutions in Software Engineering of LLM-Empowered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09721v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration. This survey serves as a foundational guide for advancing LLM-driven software engineering. We maintain a GitHub repository that continuously updates the reviewed and related papers at https://github.com/lisaGuojl/LLM-Agent-SE-Survey.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Automated Cloud Infrastructure-as-Code Reconciliation with AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20211v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally, cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating, or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs, or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may undo valid updates or trigger errors. We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372 drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$ improvement).</p></details> |  |

RAD (Rapid Application Development) platforms emerged in the nineties, but the success of modern software technologies motivated that a large number of enterprises tackled the migration of their RAD applications, such as Oracle Forms. Our research group has collaborated with a software company in developing a solution to migrate PL/SQL monolithic code on Forms triggers and program units to Java code separated in several tiers. Our research focused on the model-driven reengineering process applied to develop the migration tool for the conversion of PL/SQL code to Java. Legacy code is represented in form of KDM (Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel) models. In this paper, we propose a software process to implement a model-driven re-engineering. This process integrates a TDD-like approach to incrementally develop model transformations with three kinds of validations for the generated code. The implementation and validation of the re-engineering approach are explained in detail, as well as the evaluation of some issues related with the application of MDE.</p></details> | 31 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Integrating Transparent Models, LLMs, and Practitioner-in-the-Loop: A Case of Nonprofit Program Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19799v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering, model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy, and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[QiMeng-MuPa: Mutual-Supervised Learning for Sequential-to-Parallel Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11153v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation. Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose \textbf{QiMeng-MuPa}, a novel \textbf{Mu}tual-Supervised Learning framework for Sequential-to-\textbf{Pa}rallel code translation, to address the functional equivalence issue. QiMeng-MuPa consists of two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that QiMeng-MuPa significantly enhances the performance of the base models: when applied to Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

| **[Type-aware LLM-based Regression Test Generation for Python Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14000v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated regression test generation has been extensively explored, yet generating high-quality tests for Python programs remains particularly challenging. Because of the Python's dynamic typing features, existing approaches, ranging from search-based software testing (SBST) to recent LLM-driven techniques, are often prone to type errors. Hence, existing methods often generate invalid inputs and semantically inconsistent test cases, which ultimately undermine their practical effectiveness. To address these limitations, we present Test4Py, a novel framework that enhances type correctness in automated test generation for Python. Test4Py leverages the program's call graph to capture richer contextual information about parameters, and introduces a behavior-based type inference mechanism that accurately infers parameter types and construct valid test inputs. Beyond input construction, Test4Py integrates an iterative repair procedure that progressively refines generated test cases to improve coverage. In an evaluation on 183 real-world Python modules, Test4Py achieved an average statement coverage of 83.0% and branch coverage of 70.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art tools by 7.2% and 8.4%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Participants: Participants in this human research study include people without programming background, novice programmers, and university students with varying programming experience (from freshmen to PhD level). There were 23 participants for this study. Study Methods: This study uses an Within-Subjects Experimental Design to assess how people with diverse programming backgrounds understand and use bitwise operators. Participants complete tasks in JavaScript program, and their task completion time and accuracy of the tasks are recorded for analysis. Findings: The results indicate that operators can be one of the factors predicting response time, with a small but significant effect, with R-squared 0.032, (1, 494) = 16.5, p < .001. Additionally, some operators like OR, NOT, and Left Shift showed statistical significance in task completion times compared to other operators. Conclusions: While the complexity of bitwise operators did not generally result in longer task completion times, certain operators were found to be less intuitive, suggesting the need for further investigation and potential redesign for improved understandability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 tables, 9 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20749v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

Although prior works have focused on individual stages, comprehensive comparisons of full ETL workflows across programming languages using Apache Iceberg remain limited. The analysis was performed by executing several operations, including downloading data from CSV files, transforming and loading it into an Apache Iceberg analytical table. It was found that the performance of the Spark algorithm varies significantly depending on the amount of data and the programming language used. When processing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71 seconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of 9.62 seconds. For processing a large CSV file of 1.6 gigabytes, all programming languages demonstrated similar results: the fastest performance was showed in Python: 46.34 seconds, while Scala and Java showed results of 47.72 and 50.56 seconds, respectively. When performing a more complex operation that involved combining two CSV files into a single dataset for further loading into an Apache Iceberg table, Scala demonstrated the highest performance, at 374.42 seconds. Java processing was completed in 379.8 seconds, while Python was the least efficient, with a runtime of 398.32 seconds. It follows that the programming language significantly affects the efficiency of data processing by the Apache Spark algorithm, with Scala and Java being more productive for processing large amounts of data and complex operations, while Python demonstrates an advantage in working with small amounts of data. The results obtained can be useful for optimizing data handling processes depending on specific performance requirements and the amount of information being processed.</p></details> | <details><summary>CITI ...</summary><p>CITI 2025, 3rd International Workshop on Computer Information Technologies in Industry 4.0, June 11-12, 2025, Ternopil, Ukraine.

| **[Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Interdependence and Complementarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18802v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition where actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture it. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications achieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions provide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |

One way to catch regressions before they reach production is executing performance tests before deployment, e.g., using microbenchmarks, which measure performance at subroutine level. In projects with many microbenchmarks, this may take several hours due to repeated execution to get accurate results, disqualifying them from frequent use in CI/CD pipelines. We propose $\mu$OpTime, a static approach to reduce the execution time of microbenchmark suites by configuring the number of repetitions for each microbenchmark. Based on the results of a full, previous microbenchmark suite run, $\mu$OpTime determines the minimal number of (measurement) repetitions with statistical stability metrics that still lead to accurate results. We evaluate $\mu$OpTime with an experimental study on 14 open-source projects written in two programming languages and five stability metrics. Our results show that (i) $\mu$OpTime reduces the total suite execution time (measurement phase) by up to 95.83% (Go) and 94.17% (Java), (ii) the choice of stability metric depends on the project and programming language, (iii) microbenchmark warmup phases have to be considered for Java projects (potentially leading to higher reductions), and (iv) $\mu$OpTime can be used to reliably detect performance regressions in CI/CD pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

The domain of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is no exception, as raw data typically consists of large amounts of time-series data logging the system's status in regular time intervals. Such data has to be sanity checked and preprocessed to be consumable by data-centric workflows. We introduce CPSLint, a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide data preparation for industrial CPS. We build up on the fact that many raw data collections in the CPS domain require similar actions to render them suitable for Machine-Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) workflows, yet still vary enough to hope for one universally applicable solution. CPSLint's main features include type checking and enforcing constraints through validation and remediation for data columns, such as imputing missing data from surrounding rows. More advanced features cover inference of extra CPS-specific data structures, both column-wise and row-wise. For instance, as row-wise structures, descriptive execution phases are an effective method of data compartmentalisation are extracted and prepared for ML-assisted FDI workflows. We demonstrate CPSLint's features through a proof of concept implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Abstraction Breaks Physics: Rethinking Modular Design in Quantum Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18557v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstraction is a fundamental principle in classical software engineering, which enables modularity, reusability, and scalability. However, quantum programs adhere to fundamentally different semantics, such as unitarity, entanglement, the no-cloning theorem, and the destructive nature of measurement, which introduce challenges to the safe use of classical abstraction mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental conflict in quantum software engineering: abstraction practices that are syntactically valid may violate the physical constraints of quantum computation. We present three classes of failure cases where naive abstraction breaks quantum semantics and propose a set of design principles for physically sound abstraction mechanisms. We further propose research directions, including quantum-specific type systems, effect annotations, and contract-based module design. Our goal is to initiate a systematic rethinking of abstraction in quantum software engineering, based on quantum semantics and considering engineering scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Feedback Types in Automated Programming Assessment Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18923v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent rapid increase in digitization across all major industries, acquiring programming skills has increased the demand for introductory programming courses. This has further resulted in universities integrating programming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only technical studies but also business and management fields of study. Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and tutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of this, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing scalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and instant feedback. Commonly, APASs heavily rely on predefined unit tests for generating feedback, often limiting the scope and level of detail of feedback that can be provided to students. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years, new opportunities have emerged as these technologies can enhance feedback quality and personalization. To investigate how different feedback mechanisms in APASs are perceived by students, and how effective they are in supporting problem-solving, we have conducted a large-scale study with over 200 students from two different universities. Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard Unit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality and impact on student performance. Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most helpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances. These findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize automated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming education.</p></details> |  |
| **[InspectCoder: Dynamic Analysis-Enabled Self Repair through interactive LLM-Debugger Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18327v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning, transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RESCUE: Retrieval Augmented Secure Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18204v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still generate vulnerable code. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security knowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw security-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the significant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code generation with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base construction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize distillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security guidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a hierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base from top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each hierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated RESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure code generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE improves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed in-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness of individual components in RESCUE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Program Semantics Reasoning with Type Inference in System F](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23686v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM (Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '25, package released at: https://github.com/SecurityLab-UCD/TF-Bench</p></details> |

We identified a lack of support for problem discovery within AI innovation projects. To address this, we propose and evaluate DIP-AI, a discovery framework tailored to guide early-stage exploration in such initiatives. Based on a literature review, our solution proposal combines elements of ISO 12207, 5338, and Design Thinking to support the discovery of AI innovation projects, aiming at promoting higher quality deliveries and stakeholder satisfaction. We evaluated DIP-AI in an industry-academia collaboration (IAC) case study of an AI innovation project, in which participants applied DIP-AI to the discovery phase in practice and provided their perceptions about the approach's problem discovery capability, acceptance, and suggestions. The results indicate that DIP-AI is relevant and useful, particularly in facilitating problem discovery in AI projects. This research contributes to academia by sharing DIP-AI as a framework for AI problem discovery. For industry, we discuss the use of this framework in a real IAC program that develops AI innovation projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and accepted at SBQS25 - Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality.

Yet few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, potentially due to the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench has 111 curated and reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific out-of-order execution issue. To support reproducibility and ease of use, JunoBench offers a unified execution environment where crashes and fixes can be reliably reproduced. By providing realistic crashes and their resolutions, JunoBench facilitates bug detection, localization, and repair tailored to the interactive and iterative nature of notebook-based ML development.</p></details> |  |

It showcases modern features, including per-app address spaces, threading, commodity filesystems, USB, DMA, multicore support, self-hosted debugging, and a window manager. It supports rich applications such as 2D/3D games, music and video players, and a blockchain miner. Unlike traditional instructional systems, Proto emphasizes engaging, media-rich apps that go beyond basic terminal programs. Our method breaks down a full-featured OS into a set of incremental, self-contained prototypes. Each prototype introduces a minimal set of OS mechanisms, driven by the needs of specific apps. The construction process then progressively enables these apps by bringing up one mechanism at a time.

| **[Self-planning Code Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06689v5)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule solution steps prior to implementation. To this end, we introduce planning into code generation to help the model understand complex intent and reduce the difficulty of problem-solving. This paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach with large language models, which consists of two phases, namely planning phase and implementation phase. Specifically, in the planning phase, LLM outlines concise and formatted planning steps from the intent. Subsequently, in the implementation phase, the model generates code step by step, guided by the preceding planning steps. We conduct extensive experiments on various code-generation benchmarks across multiple programming languages. Experimental results show that self-planning code generation achieves a relative improvement of up to 25.4% in Pass@1 compared to direct code generation, and up to 11.9% compared to Chain-of-Thought code generation. Moreover, our self-planning approach also enhances the quality of the generated code with respect to correctness, readability, and robustness, as assessed by humans.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[CodeVisionary: An Agent-based Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13472v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities. However, they generally evaluate the generated code based on static prompts, and tend to fail for complex code scenarios which typically involve multiple requirements and require more contextual information. In addition, these approaches lack fine-grained evaluation for complex code, resulting in limited explainability. To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first agent-based evaluation framework for complex code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Requirement-guided multi-dimensional context distillation stage and (2) Fine-grained scoring and summarization stage. A comprehensive evaluation report is also generated for enhanced explainability. For validation, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 363 samples spanning 37 coding scenarios and 23 programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance among three baselines for evaluating complex code generation, outperforming the best baseline with average improvements of 0.217, 0.163, and 0.141 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://github.com/Eshe0922/CodeVisionary.</p></details> |  |
| **[TREAT: A Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation and Testing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17163v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models are fundamentally transforming the software engineering landscape, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks such as code generation, debugging, and testing. Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |

However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor intensive. We present an automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two real-world student code submission datasets in different programming languages.We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has proposed various methods to enhance models' CoT reasoning for code generation such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning. However, existing approaches still face three critical limitations: (1) limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths, which constrains generalization across various programming scenarios, (2) lack of quality assessment for intermediate reasoning steps, which hampers the reliability of the generated plans and code, and (3) the potential negative impact of "overthinking", potentially leading to unnecessarily complex and incorrect solutions. To address these limitations, we frame CoT code generation as a decision making problem and present SEER, a SElf-Exploring deep Reasoning framework that enables accurate and adaptive reasoning for code generation. SEER introduces three key components: (1) Diverse reasoning path exploration, which aims at exploring diverse reasoning paths and annotating intermediate steps without relying on manual experts or closed-source proprietary models; (2) Reasoning quality-aware model training, which trains a policy model for generating candidate reasoning steps and a value model for assessing their quality; and (3) Adaptive CoT reasoning, which dynamically switches between direct generation and step-by-step reasoning for different problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was completed in Feb. 2025, submitted to ICSE 2026 in Mar. 2025, received a major revision in Jun. 2025, and was finally accepted in Oct. 2025</p></details> |

Even novice developers can now design and generate complex framework-constrained software systems based on their high-level requirements with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when LLMs gradually "take the wheel" of software development, developers may only check whether the program works. They often miss security problems hidden in how the generated programs are implemented. In this work, we investigate the security properties of framework-constrained programs generated by state-of-the-art LLMs. We focus specifically on Chrome extensions due to their complex security model involving multiple privilege boundaries and isolated components. To achieve this, we built ChromeSecBench, a dataset with 140 prompts based on known vulnerable extensions. We used these prompts to instruct nine state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete Chrome extensions, and then analyzed them for vulnerabilities across three dimensions: scenario types, model differences, and vulnerability categories. Our results show that LLMs produced vulnerable programs at alarmingly high rates (18%-50%), particularly in Authentication & Identity and Cookie Management scenarios (up to 83% and 78% respectively). Most vulnerabilities exposed sensitive browser data like cookies, history, or bookmarks to untrusted code. Interestingly, we found that advanced reasoning models performed worse, generating more vulnerabilities than simpler models. These findings highlight a critical gap between LLMs' coding skills and their ability to write secure framework-constrained programs.</p></details> |  |

We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents QuanBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on quantum code generation. QuanBench includes 44 programming tasks that cover quantum algorithms, state preparation, gate decomposition, and quantum machine learning. Each task has an executable canonical solution and is evaluated by functional correctness (Pass@K) and quantum semantic equivalence (Process Fidelity). We evaluate several recent LLMs, including general-purpose and code-specialized models. The results show that current LLMs have limited capability in generating the correct quantum code, with overall accuracy below 40% and frequent semantic errors. We also analyze common failure cases, such as outdated API usage, circuit construction errors, and incorrect algorithm logic. QuanBench provides a basis for future work on improving quantum code generation with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by ASE2025</p></details> |

However, systematic analysis of these agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p></details> |  |

Quantum program testing has emerged as a prominent research area within the scope of quantum software engineering. While numerous approaches have been proposed to address quantum program quality assurance, our analysis reveals that most existing methods rely on measurement-based validation in practice. However, due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum programs, measurement-based validation methods face significant limitations. To investigate these limitations, we conducted an empirical study of recent research on quantum program testing, analyzing measurement-based validation methods in the literature. Our analysis categorizes existing measurement-based validation methods into two groups: distribution-level validation and output-value-level validation. We then compare measurement-based validation with statevector-based validation methods to evaluate their pros and cons. Our findings demonstrate that measurement-based validation is suitable for straightforward assessments, such as verifying the existence of specific output values, while statevector-based validation proves more effective for complicated tasks such as assessing the program behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be appeared in the proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025), NIER track, Seoul, South Korea, November 16 -20, 2025</p></details> |

As programmers lean more heavily on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants to develop code solutions, it is becoming increasingly important for programmers to comprehend GenAI solutions so that they can verify their appropriateness and properly integrate them into existing code. At the same time, GenAI tools are increasingly being enlisted to provide programmers with tailored explanations of code written both by GenAI and humans. Thus, in computing education, GenAI presents new challenges and opportunities for learners who are trying to comprehend computer programs. To provide computing educators with evidence-based guidance on the use of GenAI to facilitate code comprehension and to identify directions for future research, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of state-of-the-art approaches and tools that leverage GenAI to enhance code comprehension. Our SLR focuses on 31 studies published between 2022 and 2024. Despite their potential, GenAI assistants often yield inaccurate or unclear explanations, and novice programmers frequently struggle to craft effective prompts, thereby impeding their ability to leverage GenAI to aid code comprehension. Our review classifies GenAI-based approaches and tools, identifies methods used to study them, and summarizes the empirical evaluations of their effectiveness. We consider the implications of our findings for computing education research and practice, and identify directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce TritonRL, a domain-specialized LLM for Triton kernel generation, trained with a novel training framework that enables robust and automated kernel synthesis. Unlike general-purpose programming languages, Triton kernel generation faces unique challenges due to data scarcity and incomplete evaluation criteria, vulnerable to reward hacking. Our approach addresses these challenges end-to-end by distilling Triton-specific knowledge through supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets, and further improving code quality via reinforcement learning (RL) with robust, verifiable rewards and hierarchical reward assignment. Our RL framework robustly detects reward hacking and guides both reasoning traces and code tokens through fine-grained verification and hierarchical reward decomposition, enabling the model to generate high-quality Triton kernels that can truly replace existing modules. With robust and fine-grained evaluation, our experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that TritonRL achieves state-of-the-art correctness and speedup, surpassing all other Triton-specific models and underscoring the effectiveness of our RL-based training paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Aligned Code Readability Assessment with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16579v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code readability is crucial for software comprehension and maintenance, yet difficult to assess at scale. Traditional static metrics often fail to capture the subjective, context-sensitive nature of human judgments. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative, but their behavior as readability evaluators remains underexplored. We introduce CoReEval, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLM-based code readability assessment, comprising over 1.4 million model-snippet-prompt evaluations across 10 state of the art LLMs. The benchmark spans 3 programming languages (Java, Python, CUDA), 2 code types (functional code and unit tests), 4 prompting strategies (ZSL, FSL, CoT, ToT), 9 decoding settings, and developer-guided prompts tailored to junior and senior personas. We compare LLM outputs against human annotations and a validated static model, analyzing numerical alignment (MAE, Pearson's, Spearman's) and justification quality (sentiment, aspect coverage, semantic clustering). Our findings show that developer-guided prompting grounded in human-defined readability dimensions improves alignment in structured contexts, enhances explanation quality, and enables lightweight personalization through persona framing. However, increased score variability highlights trade-offs between alignment, stability, and interpretability. CoReEval provides a robust foundation for prompt engineering, model alignment studies, and human in the loop evaluation, with applications in education, onboarding, and CI/CD pipelines where LLMs can serve as explainable, adaptable reviewers.</p></details> |  |

Objective: This paper proposes and empirically applies a causal model to help educators scaffold responsible GenAI use in Software Engineering (SE) education. The model identifies how professor actions, student factors, and GenAI tool characteristics influence students' usage of GenAI tools. Method: Using a design-based research approach, we applied the model in two contexts: (1) revising four extensive lab assignments of a final-year Software Testing course at Queen's University Belfast (QUB), and (2) embedding GenAI-related competencies into the curriculum of a newly developed SE BSc program at Azerbaijan Technical University (AzTU). Interventions included GenAI usage declarations, output validation tasks, peer-review of AI artifacts, and career-relevant messaging. Results: TBD Conclusions: TBD</p></details> |  |

As part of HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming. Our code and dataset are also public available(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Typical existing approaches mine optimization commits from open-source codebases to construct a large-scale knowledge base, then employ information retrieval techniques such as BM25 to retrieve relevant optimization examples for hotspot code locations, thereby guiding LLMs to optimize these hotspots. However, since semantically equivalent optimizations can manifest in syntactically dissimilar code snippets, current retrieval methods often fail to identify pertinent examples, leading to suboptimal optimization performance. This limitation significantly reduces the effectiveness of existing optimization approaches. To address these limitations, we propose SemOpt, a novel framework that leverages static program analysis to precisely identify optimizable code segments, retrieve the corresponding optimization strategies, and generate the optimized results. SemOpt consists of three key components: (1) A strategy library builder that extracts and clusters optimization strategies from real-world code modifications. (2) A rule generator that generates Semgrep static analysis rules to capture the condition of applying the optimization strategy. (3) An optimizer that utilizes the strategy library to generate optimized code results. All the three components are powered by LLMs. On our benchmark containing 151 optimization tasks, SemOpt demonstrates its effectiveness under different LLMs by increasing the number of successful optimizations by 1.38 to 28 times compared to the baseline. Moreover, on popular large-scale C/C++ projects, it can improve individual performance metrics by 5.04% to 218.07%, demonstrating its practical utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLCPD: A Unified Multi-Language Code Parsing Dataset with Universal AST Schema](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16357v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the MultiLang Code Parser Dataset (MLCPD), a large-scale, language-agnostic dataset unifying syntactic and structural representations of code across ten major programming languages. MLCPD contains over seven million parsed source files normalized under our proposed universal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) schema, enabling consistent cross-language reasoning, structural learning, and multilingual software analysis. Unlike existing corpora that focus purely on token-level code or isolated parsers, MLCPD provides both hierarchical tree representations and rich metadata for every file, ensuring lossless syntactic coverage and structural uniformity. Each entry includes a normalized schema, language-level metadata, and abstracted node semantics stored in Parquet format for scalable retrieval. Empirical analyses reveal strong cross-language structural regularities-demonstrating that syntactic graphs from languages as diverse as Python, Java, and Go can be aligned under a shared schema. We release the dataset publicly on Hugging Face and the accompanying codebase on GitHub, which includes complete pipelines for dataset reproduction, grammar compilation, and a visualization tool for exploring the unified AST across languages. Together, these resources establish MLCPD as an open, reproducible foundation for future research in cross-language representation learning and program analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms, and 34 references.

This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60 ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of 0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.</p></details> |  |

Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub(https://github.com/trishullab/clever) as well as HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever).

| **[Exploring Large Language Models for Access Control Policy Synthesis and Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20692v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies, they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Software projects typically include an average of 36 dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off, we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs. JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and reliable debloated software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - accepted at the ACM Workshop on Software Supply Chain Offensive Research and Ecosystem Defenses (SCORED '25)</p></details> |
| **[How Quickly Do Development Teams Update Their Vulnerable Dependencies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17382v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry practitioners are increasingly concerned with software that contains vulnerable versions of third-party dependencies that are included both directly and transitively. To address this problem, projects are encouraged to both (a)~quickly update to non-vulnerable versions of dependencies and (b)~be mindful of the update practices of the dependencies they choose to use. To this end, researchers have proposed metrics to measure the responsiveness of the development teams of the packages in keeping their dependencies updated: Mean-Time-To-Update (MTTU) and Mean-Time-To-Remediate (MTTR). While MTTU covers all dependencies, MTTR quantifies the time needed for a package to update its vulnerable dependencies. However, existing metrics fail to capture important nuances, such as considering floating versions and prioritizing recent updates, leading to inaccurate reflections of a development team's update practices. \textit{The goal of this study is to aid practitioners in understanding how quickly packages update their dependencies.} We propose two novel metrics, Mean-Time-To-Update for dependencies (MTTU) and Mean-Time-To-Remediate for vulnerable dependencies (MTTR), that overcome the limitations of existing metrics. We conduct an empirical study using $163,207$ packages in npm ($117,129$), PyPI ($42,777$), and Cargo ($3,301$) and characterize how the ecosystems differ in MTTU and MTTR, as well as what package characteristics influence MTTU and MTTR. We found that most packages have a relatively fast dependency update practice. We further study whether MTTU can be used as a proxy for MTTR when sufficient vulnerability data is not available. As we did not find enough statistical evidence for a strong proxy, our findings suggest that MTTU could only be partially used (may be used but with caution) as a proxy for MTTR when vulnerability data is not available.</p></details> | under review |

Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process.

| **[Which Is Better For Reducing Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Pinning or Floating?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08609v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning} as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common. We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable dependencies.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE 2025 |

However, the effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks, but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

In spite of its proven usefulness and feasibility in selected projects, deductive verification is still not a mainstream technique. To pave the way to widespread use, we present a study investigating the factors enabling successful applications of deductive verification and the underlying issues preventing broader adoption. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners of verification from both industry and academia and systematically analyzed the collected data employing a thematic analysis approach. Beside empirically confirming familiar challenges, e.g., the high level of expertise needed for conducting formal proofs, our data reveal several underexplored obstacles, such as proof maintenance, insufficient control over automation, and usability concerns. We further use the results from our data analysis to extract enablers and barriers for deductive verification and formulate concrete recommendations for practitioners, tool builders, and researchers, including principles for usability, automation, and integration with existing workflows.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation, Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs for automated code review.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate representative open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks, but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

This fails to reflect the holistic context-rich nature of real-world CR. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeFuse-CR-Bench, the first comprehensiveness-aware benchmark for repository-level CR evaluation. CodeFuse-CR-Bench comprises 601 high-quality instances from 70 Python projects covering nine Pull-Request (PR) problem domains, where each instance provides rich, multi-faceted context including the associated issue, PR details, and repository state, enabling end-to-end evaluation. Beyond superficial metrics, we also propose a novel evaluation framework that combines rule-based checks for location and syntax with model-based judgments of review quality. We present the first large-scale assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on this comprehensive CR task. Our results establish crucial baselines and reveal that (1) no single LLM dominates all aspects of CR; (2) Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest comprehensive performance; and (3) different LLMs exhibit varying robustness to redundant context. These findings highlight the necessity of holistic, multi-dimensional evaluation and provide actionable insights for advancing truly intelligent yet practical CR assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Benchmarks and Solutions in Software Engineering of LLM-Empowered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09721v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration. This survey serves as a foundational guide for advancing LLM-driven software engineering. We maintain a GitHub repository that continuously updates the reviewed and related papers at https://github.com/lisaGuojl/LLM-Agent-SE-Survey.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Automated Cloud Infrastructure-as-Code Reconciliation with AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20211v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally, cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating, or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs, or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may undo valid updates or trigger errors. We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372 drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$ improvement).</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60 ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of 0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.</p></details> |  |

Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies, they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Software projects typically include an average of 36 dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off, we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs. JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts.

On the other hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning} as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common. We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable dependencies.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE 2025 |

| **[How Quickly Do Development Teams Update Their Vulnerable Dependencies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17382v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry practitioners are increasingly concerned with software that contains vulnerable versions of third-party dependencies that are included both directly and transitively. To address this problem, projects are encouraged to both (a)~quickly update to non-vulnerable versions of dependencies and (b)~be mindful of the update practices of the dependencies they choose to use. To this end, researchers have proposed metrics to measure the responsiveness of the development teams of the packages in keeping their dependencies updated: Mean-Time-To-Update (MTTU) and Mean-Time-To-Remediate (MTTR). While MTTU covers all dependencies, MTTR quantifies the time needed for a package to update its vulnerable dependencies. However, existing metrics fail to capture important nuances, such as considering floating versions and prioritizing recent updates, leading to inaccurate reflections of a development team's update practices. \textit{The goal of this study is to aid practitioners in understanding how quickly packages update their dependencies.} We propose two novel metrics, Mean-Time-To-Update for dependencies (MTTU) and Mean-Time-To-Remediate for vulnerable dependencies (MTTR), that overcome the limitations of existing metrics. We conduct an empirical study using $163,207$ packages in npm ($117,129$), PyPI ($42,777$), and Cargo ($3,301$) and characterize how the ecosystems differ in MTTU and MTTR, as well as what package characteristics influence MTTU and MTTR. We found that most packages have a relatively fast dependency update practice. We further study whether MTTU can be used as a proxy for MTTR when sufficient vulnerability data is not available. As we did not find enough statistical evidence for a strong proxy, our findings suggest that MTTU could only be partially used (may be used but with caution) as a proxy for MTTR when vulnerability data is not available.</p></details> | under review |

In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

To pave the way to widespread use, we present a study investigating the factors enabling successful applications of deductive verification and the underlying issues preventing broader adoption. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners of verification from both industry and academia and systematically analyzed the collected data employing a thematic analysis approach. Beside empirically confirming familiar challenges, e.g., the high level of expertise needed for conducting formal proofs, our data reveal several underexplored obstacles, such as proof maintenance, insufficient control over automation, and usability concerns. We further use the results from our data analysis to extract enablers and barriers for deductive verification and formulate concrete recommendations for practitioners, tool builders, and researchers, including principles for usability, automation, and integration with existing workflows.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation, Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs for automated code review.</p></details> |  |

One prevalent approach to ensuring the safety of neural policies is to deploy programmatic runtime shields alongside them to correct their unsafe commands. However, the programmatic runtime shields synthesized by existing methods are either computationally expensive or insufficiently permissive, resulting in high overhead and unnecessary interventions on the system. To address these challenges, we propose Aegis, a novel framework that synthesizes lightweight and permissive programmatic runtime shields for neural policies. Aegis achieves this by formulating the seeking of a runtime shield as a sketch-based program synthesis problem and proposing a novel method that leverages counterexample-guided inductive synthesis and Bayesian optimization to solve it. To evaluate Aegis and its synthesized shields, we use eight representative control systems and compare Aegis with the current state-of-the-art. Our results show that the programmatic runtime shields synthesized by Aegis can correct all unsafe commands from neural policies, ensuring that the systems do not violate any desired safety properties at all times. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, Aegis's shields exhibit a 2.2$\times$ reduction in time overhead and a 3.9$\times$ reduction in memory usage, suggesting that they are much more lightweight. Moreover, Aegis's shields incur an average of 1.5$\times$ fewer interventions than other shields, showing better permissiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 39 pages</p></details> |

This fails to reflect the holistic context-rich nature of real-world CR. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeFuse-CR-Bench, the first comprehensiveness-aware benchmark for repository-level CR evaluation. CodeFuse-CR-Bench comprises 601 high-quality instances from 70 Python projects covering nine Pull-Request (PR) problem domains, where each instance provides rich, multi-faceted context including the associated issue, PR details, and repository state, enabling end-to-end evaluation. Beyond superficial metrics, we also propose a novel evaluation framework that combines rule-based checks for location and syntax with model-based judgments of review quality. We present the first large-scale assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on this comprehensive CR task. Our results establish crucial baselines and reveal that (1) no single LLM dominates all aspects of CR; (2) Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest comprehensive performance; and (3) different LLMs exhibit varying robustness to redundant context. These findings highlight the necessity of holistic, multi-dimensional evaluation and provide actionable insights for advancing truly intelligent yet practical CR assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Benchmarks and Solutions in Software Engineering of LLM-Empowered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09721v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration. This survey serves as a foundational guide for advancing LLM-driven software engineering. We maintain a GitHub repository that continuously updates the reviewed and related papers at https://github.com/lisaGuojl/LLM-Agent-SE-Survey.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Automated Cloud Infrastructure-as-Code Reconciliation with AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20211v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally, cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating, or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs, or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may undo valid updates or trigger errors. We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372 drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$ improvement).</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Have LLMs Come Toward Automated SATD Taxonomy Construction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09601v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technical debt refers to suboptimal code that degrades software quality. When developers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its categories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing such taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding code, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to annotator subjectivity. In this study, we investigated to what extent large language models (LLMs) could generate SATD taxonomies. We designed a structured, LLM-driven pipeline that mirrors the taxonomy construction steps researchers typically follow. We evaluated it on SATD datasets from three domains: quantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully recovered domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer Configuration in machine learning. It also completed taxonomy generation in under two hours and for less than $1, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that, while full automation remains challenging, LLMs can support semi-automated SATD taxonomy construction. Furthermore, our work opens up avenues for future work, such as automated taxonomy generation in other areas.</p></details> | 5 pages, APSEC 2025 |

RAD (Rapid Application Development) platforms emerged in the nineties, but the success of modern software technologies motivated that a large number of enterprises tackled the migration of their RAD applications, such as Oracle Forms. Our research group has collaborated with a software company in developing a solution to migrate PL/SQL monolithic code on Forms triggers and program units to Java code separated in several tiers. Our research focused on the model-driven reengineering process applied to develop the migration tool for the conversion of PL/SQL code to Java. Legacy code is represented in form of KDM (Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel) models. In this paper, we propose a software process to implement a model-driven re-engineering. This process integrates a TDD-like approach to incrementally develop model transformations with three kinds of validations for the generated code. The implementation and validation of the re-engineering approach are explained in detail, as well as the evaluation of some issues related with the application of MDE.</p></details> | 31 pages, 22 figures |

Cache layers achieving 99% hit rates can obscure database bottlenecks until cache failures trigger 100x load amplification and cascading collapse. Current reliability engineering focuses on reactive incident response rather than proactive detection of optimization-induced vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for systematic latent risk detection, prevention, and optimization through integrated mathematical modeling, intelligent perturbation testing, and risk-aware performance optimization. We introduce the Latent Risk Index (LRI) that correlates strongly with incident severity (r=0.863, p<0.001), enabling predictive risk assessment. Our framework integrates three systems: HYDRA employing six optimization-aware perturbation strategies achieving 89.7% risk discovery rates, RAVEN providing continuous production monitoring with 92.9% precision and 93.8% recall across 1,748 scenarios, and APEX enabling risk-aware optimization maintaining 96.6% baseline performance while reducing latent risks by 59.2%. Evaluation across three testbed environments demonstrates strong statistical validation with large effect sizes (Cohen d>2.0) and exceptional reproducibility (r>0.92). Production deployment over 24 weeks shows 69.1% mean time to recovery reduction, 78.6% incident severity reduction, and 81 prevented incidents generating 1.44M USD average annual benefits with 3.2-month ROI. Our approach transforms reliability engineering from reactive incident management to proactive risk-aware optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 tables, 4 figures.

| **[The Cost of Downgrading Build Systems: A Case Study of Kubernetes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20041v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since developers invoke the build system frequently, its performance can impact productivity. Modern artifact-based build tools accelerate builds, yet prior work shows that teams may abandon them for alternatives that are easier to maintain. While prior work shows why downgrades are performed, the implications of downgrades remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we describe a case study of the Kubernetes project, focusing on its downgrade from an artifact-based build tool (Bazel) to a language-specific solution (Go Build). We reproduce and analyze the full and incremental builds of change sets during the downgrade period. On the one hand, we find that Bazel builds are faster than Go Build, completing full builds in 23.06-38.66 up to 75.19 impose a larger memory footprint than Go Build of 81.42-351.07 respectively. Bazel builds also impose a greater CPU load at parallelism settings above eight for full builds and above one for incremental builds. We estimate that downgrading from Bazel can increase CI resource costs by up to 76 explore whether our observations generalize by replicating our Kubernetes study on four other projects that also downgraded from Bazel to older build tools. We observe that while build time penalties decrease, Bazel consistently consumes more memory. We conclude that abandoning artifact-based build tools, despite perceived maintainability benefits, tends to incur considerable performance costs for large projects. Our observations may help stakeholders to balance trade-offs in build tool adoption</p></details> |  |

LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of 8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review</p></details> |

Midsize organizations encounter resource constraints and limited AI expertise, while enterprises struggle with organizational complexity and coordination challenges. Existing technology adoption frameworks, including TAM (Technology Acceptance Model), TOE (Technology Organization Environment), and DOI (Diffusion of Innovations) theory, lack the specificity required for GenAI implementation across these diverse contexts, creating a critical gap in adoption literature. This paper introduces FAIGMOE (Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises), a conceptual framework addressing the unique needs of both organizational types. FAIGMOE synthesizes technology adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion perspectives into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and Operationalization and Optimization. Each phase provides scalable guidance on readiness assessment, strategic alignment, risk governance, technical architecture, and change management adaptable to organizational scale and complexity. The framework incorporates GenAI specific considerations including prompt engineering, model orchestration, and hallucination management that distinguish it from generic technology adoption frameworks. As a perspective contribution, FAIGMOE provides the first comprehensive conceptual framework explicitly addressing GenAI adoption across midsize and enterprise organizations, offering actionable implementation protocols, assessment instruments, and governance templates requiring empirical validation through future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Interaction Effects in Greybox Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19984v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A greybox fuzzer is an automated software testing tool that generates new test inputs by applying randomly chosen mutators (e.g., flipping a bit or deleting a block of bytes) to a seed input in random order and adds all coverage-increasing inputs to the corpus of seeds. We hypothesize that the order in which mutators are applied to a seed input has an impact on the effectiveness of greybox fuzzers. In our experiments, we fit a linear model to a dataset that contains the effectiveness of all possible mutator pairs and indeed observe the conjectured interaction effect. This points us to more efficient fuzzing by choosing the most promising mutator sequence with a higher likelihood. We propose MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that learns and chooses the most promising mutator sequences. MuoFuzz learns the conditional probability that the next mutator will yield an interesting input, given the previously selected mutator. Then, it samples from the learned probability using a random walk to generate mutator sequences. We compare the performance of MuoFuzz to AFL++, which uses a fixed selection probability, and MOPT, which optimizes the selection probability of each mutator in isolation. Experimental results on the FuzzBench and MAGMA benchmarks show that MuoFuzz achieves the highest code coverage and finds four bugs missed by AFL++ and one missed by both AFL++ and MOPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, Accepted for presentation at the 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '26)</p></details> |

However, protecting model privacy without sacrificing the performance benefits of untrusted AI accelerators, such as GPUs, presents a challenging trade-off. In this paper, we initiate the study of high-performance execution on LLMs and present SecureInfer, a hybrid framework that leverages a heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-GPU architecture to isolate privacy-critical components while offloading compute-intensive operations to untrusted accelerators. Building upon an outsourcing scheme, SecureInfer adopts an information-theoretic and threat-informed partitioning strategy: security-sensitive components, including non-linear layers, projection of attention head, FNN transformations, and LoRA adapters, are executed inside an SGX enclave, while other linear operations (matrix multiplication) are performed on the GPU after encryption and are securely restored within the enclave. We implement a prototype of SecureInfer using the LLaMA-2 model and evaluate it across performance and security metrics. Our results show that SecureInfer offers strong security guarantees with reasonable performance, offering a practical solution for secure on-device model inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Intelligent Computing and Systems at the Edge (ICEdge) 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a novel method for synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning, outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over three seeds.</p></details> |  |

This study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering, model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy, and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOSQTGEN: Breaking the Sound Barrier in Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19777v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software is increasingly built by composing APIs, elevating the API contract to a critical role. Inadequate contracts, however, lead to mismatched expectations and failures, creating a pressing need for robust conformance testing. Current test generation techniques are hindered by key challenges: polyglot systems, source code inaccessibility, a cost-reliability trade-off, and, most critically, the difficulty of generating structured inputs. We introduce BOSQTGEN, a novel black-box methodology and tool for API test generation. BOSQTGEN utilizes a novel approach for decomposing API specifications into primitives, using LLMs to suggest coherent strata for them, and employing combinatorial testing to efficiently sample over these values. This approach ensures coverage of critical interactions while avoiding the redundancy of random sampling. The resulting BOSQTGEN system achieves an average of 82% code coverage on RESTful benchmarks, often a 20% or more increase over prior state-of-the-art systems and nearing parity with hand-written test suites. Providing a fully API-driven approach to test generation, enables developers to automatically create high-quality test cases for validation or test-driven development.</p></details> |  |

Our survey reviews recent platforms that let users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration, output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type (chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration, and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs (customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 6th World Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Advances and Applications (WCAIAA 2025)</p></details> |

As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a reality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area. While early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related activities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a range of socio-technical concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to the emerging community vision by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope beyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations and evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary set of values and principles to guide efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on designing/using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE. It is hoped that these ideas will encourage community collaborations and steer the SE community towards laying strong foundations of agentic SE so its not only inevitable but also deliberate and desirable in the long run.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns, particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information, multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering, automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion, peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully self-driving materials discovery.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation. Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose \textbf{QiMeng-MuPa}, a novel \textbf{Mu}tual-Supervised Learning framework for Sequential-to-\textbf{Pa}rallel code translation, to address the functional equivalence issue. QiMeng-MuPa consists of two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that QiMeng-MuPa significantly enhances the performance of the base models: when applied to Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

However, fidelity issues often degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89% and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%, Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.</p></details> |  |

| **[Handling Open-Vocabulary Constructs in Formalizing Specifications: Retrieval-Augmented Parsing with Expert Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08808v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of Open-Vocabulary Constructs(OVCs) -- ones not known beforehand -- in the context of converting natural language (NL) specifications into formal languages (e.g., temporal logic or code). Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |
| **[ETF: An Entity Tracing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Code Summaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14748v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to understand both natural language and code, driving their use in tasks like natural language-to-code (NL2Code) and code summarisation. However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Limitations of Embedding Based Methods for Measuring Functional Correctness for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01580v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of code generation from natural language (NL2Code) has become extremely popular, especially with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Meet NL2Code: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09420v2)** | 2023-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of generating code from a natural language description, or NL2Code, is considered a pressing and significant challenge in code intelligence. Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning.

| **[Exploring Large Language Models for Access Control Policy Synthesis and Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20692v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies, they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Soundness and Precision Benchmark for Java Debloating Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20679v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software development reuses code by importing libraries as dependencies. Software projects typically include an average of 36 dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off, we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs. JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and reliable debloated software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - accepted at the ACM Workshop on Software Supply Chain Offensive Research and Ecosystem Defenses (SCORED '25)</p></details> |

In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Large Language Models for Fault Localization: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20521v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks, but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[Fine-Tuning Multilingual Language Models for Code Review: An Empirical Study on Industrial C# Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19271v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but often time-consuming and cognitively demanding, especially in industrial environments. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation, Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs for automated code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeFuse-CR-Bench: A Comprehensiveness-aware Benchmark for End-to-End Code Review Evaluation in Python Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14856v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code review (CR) is a key application for Large Language Models (LLMs), but progress is hampered by a "reality gap": existing benchmarks evaluate models on isolated sub-tasks using simplified, context-poor data. This fails to reflect the holistic context-rich nature of real-world CR. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeFuse-CR-Bench, the first comprehensiveness-aware benchmark for repository-level CR evaluation. CodeFuse-CR-Bench comprises 601 high-quality instances from 70 Python projects covering nine Pull-Request (PR) problem domains, where each instance provides rich, multi-faceted context including the associated issue, PR details, and repository state, enabling end-to-end evaluation. Beyond superficial metrics, we also propose a novel evaluation framework that combines rule-based checks for location and syntax with model-based judgments of review quality. We present the first large-scale assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on this comprehensive CR task. Our results establish crucial baselines and reveal that (1) no single LLM dominates all aspects of CR; (2) Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest comprehensive performance; and (3) different LLMs exhibit varying robustness to redundant context. These findings highlight the necessity of holistic, multi-dimensional evaluation and provide actionable insights for advancing truly intelligent yet practical CR assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Benchmarks and Solutions in Software Engineering of LLM-Empowered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09721v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration. This survey serves as a foundational guide for advancing LLM-driven software engineering.

| **[Automated Cloud Infrastructure-as-Code Reconciliation with AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20211v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally, cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating, or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs, or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may undo valid updates or trigger errors. We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372 drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$ improvement).</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Have LLMs Come Toward Automated SATD Taxonomy Construction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09601v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technical debt refers to suboptimal code that degrades software quality. When developers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its categories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing such taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding code, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to annotator subjectivity. In this study, we investigated to what extent large language models (LLMs) could generate SATD taxonomies. We designed a structured, LLM-driven pipeline that mirrors the taxonomy construction steps researchers typically follow. We evaluated it on SATD datasets from three domains: quantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully recovered domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer Configuration in machine learning. It also completed taxonomy generation in under two hours and for less than $1, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that, while full automation remains challenging, LLMs can support semi-automated SATD taxonomy construction. Furthermore, our work opens up avenues for future work, such as automated taxonomy generation in other areas.</p></details> | 5 pages, APSEC 2025 |

| **[Learning to Triage Taint Flows Reported by Dynamic Program Analysis in Node.js Packages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20739v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program analysis tools often produce large volumes of candidate vulnerability reports that require costly manual review, creating a practical challenge: how can security analysts prioritize the reports most likely to be true vulnerabilities? This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60 ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of 0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.</p></details> |  |

| **[How Quickly Do Development Teams Update Their Vulnerable Dependencies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17382v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry practitioners are increasingly concerned with software that contains vulnerable versions of third-party dependencies that are included both directly and transitively. To address this problem, projects are encouraged to both (a)~quickly update to non-vulnerable versions of dependencies and (b)~be mindful of the update practices of the dependencies they choose to use. To this end, researchers have proposed metrics to measure the responsiveness of the development teams of the packages in keeping their dependencies updated: Mean-Time-To-Update (MTTU) and Mean-Time-To-Remediate (MTTR). While MTTU covers all dependencies, MTTR quantifies the time needed for a package to update its vulnerable dependencies. However, existing metrics fail to capture important nuances, such as considering floating versions and prioritizing recent updates, leading to inaccurate reflections of a development team's update practices. \textit{The goal of this study is to aid practitioners in understanding how quickly packages update their dependencies.} We propose two novel metrics, Mean-Time-To-Update for dependencies (MTTU) and Mean-Time-To-Remediate for vulnerable dependencies (MTTR), that overcome the limitations of existing metrics. We conduct an empirical study using $163,207$ packages in npm ($117,129$), PyPI ($42,777$), and Cargo ($3,301$) and characterize how the ecosystems differ in MTTU and MTTR, as well as what package characteristics influence MTTU and MTTR. We found that most packages have a relatively fast dependency update practice. We further study whether MTTU can be used as a proxy for MTTR when sufficient vulnerability data is not available. As we did not find enough statistical evidence for a strong proxy, our findings suggest that MTTU could only be partially used (may be used but with caution) as a proxy for MTTR when vulnerability data is not available.</p></details> | under review |

| **[Which Is Better For Reducing Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Pinning or Floating?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08609v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning} as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common. We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable dependencies.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE 2025 |
