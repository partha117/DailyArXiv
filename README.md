| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Python Programming Education with an AI-Powered Code Helper: Design, Implementation, and Impact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20518v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Co-evolutionary Metamorphic Differential Testing for Autonomous Systems with an Interpretability Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16478v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, such as autonomous driving systems, evolve rapidly through frequent updates, risking unintended behavioral degradations. Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment. CoCoMagic offers an efficient, effective, and interpretable way for the differential testing of evolving autonomous systems across versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous systems, giving rise to a new class of software known as Agentware, where LLM-powered agents perform complex, open-ended tasks in domains such as software engineering, customer service, and data analysis. However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |
| **[From Legacy Fortran to Portable Kokkos: An Autonomous Agentic AI Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12443v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of Programmers' Trust in Generative AI Programming Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13253v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation. Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Good Vibrations? A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rethinking Technology Stack Selection with AI Coding Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11132v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now an integral part of software development workflows and are reshaping the whole process. Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[ViScratch: Using Large Language Models and Gameplay Videos for Automated Feedback in Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11065v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based programming environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in programming education, in particular for young learners. While the use of blocks helps prevent syntax errors, semantic bugs remain common and difficult to debug. Existing tools for Scratch debugging rely heavily on predefined rules or user manual inputs, and crucially, they ignore the platform's inherently visual nature. We introduce ViScratch, the first multimodal feedback generation system for Scratch that leverages both the project's block code and its generated gameplay video to diagnose and repair bugs. ViScratch uses a two-stage pipeline: a vision-language model first aligns visual symptoms with code structure to identify a single critical issue, then proposes minimal, abstract syntax tree level repairs that are verified via execution in the Scratch virtual machine. We evaluate ViScratch on a set of real-world Scratch projects against state-of-the-art LLM-based tools and human testers. Results show that gameplay video is a crucial debugging signal: ViScratch substantially outperforms prior tools in both bug identification and repair quality, even without access to project descriptions or goals. This work demonstrates that video can serve as a first-class specification in visual programming environments, opening new directions for LLM-based debugging beyond symbolic code alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Testing and Adapting REST APIs as LLM Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15546v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build autonomous agents that perform complex tasks with external tools, often exposed through APIs in enterprise systems. Direct use of these APIs is difficult due to the complex input schema and verbose responses. Current benchmarks overlook these challenges, leaving a gap in assessing API readiness for agent-driven automation. We present a testing framework that systematically evaluates enterprise APIs when wrapped as Python tools for LLM-based agents. The framework generates data-aware test cases, translates them into natural language instructions, and evaluates whether agents can correctly invoke the tool, handle their inputs, and process its responses. We apply the framework to generate over 2400 test cases across different domains and develop a taxonomy of common errors, including input misinterpretation, output failures, and schema mismatches. We further classify errors to support debugging and tool refinement. Our framework provides a systematic approach to enabling enterprise APIs as reliable tools for agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aspect-Oriented Programming in Secure Software Development: A Case Study of Security Aspects in Web Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07449v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security remains a critical challenge in modern web applications, where threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks continue to undermine trust and reliability. Traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality, leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging, and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches. Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code, coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators. Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers seeking to balance security with software quality in web application development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Challenging Bug Prediction and Repair Models with Synthetic Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02407v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs are essential in software engineering; many research studies in the past decades have been proposed to detect, localize, and repair bugs in software systems. Effectiveness evaluation of such techniques requires complex bugs, i.e., those that are hard to detect through testing and hard to repair through debugging. From the classic software engineering point of view, a hard-to-repair bug differs from the correct code in multiple locations, making it hard to localize and repair. Hard-to-detect bugs, on the other hand, manifest themselves under specific test inputs and reachability conditions. These two objectives, i.e., generating hard-to-detect and hard-to-repair bugs, are mostly aligned; a bug generation technique can change multiple statements to be covered only under a specific set of inputs. However, these two objectives are conflicting for learning-based techniques: A bug should have a similar code representation to the correct code in the training data to challenge a bug prediction model to distinguish them. The hard-to-repair bug definition remains the same but with a caveat: the more a bug differs from the original code, the more distant their representations are and easier to be detected. We propose BugFarm, to transform arbitrary code into multiple complex bugs. BugFarm leverages LLMs to mutate code in multiple locations (hard-to-repair). To ensure that multiple modifications do not notably change the code representation, BugFarm analyzes the attention of the underlying model and instructs LLMs to only change the least attended locations (hard-to-detect). Our comprehensive evaluation of 435k+ bugs from over 1.9M mutants generated by BUGFARM and two alternative approaches demonstrates our superiority in generating bugs that are hard to detect by learning-based bug prediction approaches and hard-to-repair by state-of-the-art learning-based program repair technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in SCAM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and repairing faults when programs fail to formally verify can be complex and time-consuming. Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIO: Multiverse Debugging in the Face of Input/Output -- Extended Version with Additional Appendices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06845v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution paths within the state space. Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e. states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse, may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is caused by the debugger. This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during regular execution. We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our techniques. As a demonstration of the approach we highlight a color dial built with a Lego Mindstorms motor, and color sensor, providing a tangible example of how our approach enables multiverse debugging for programs running on an STM32 microcontroller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This extended version provides auxiliary material to the article of the same title that will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the PACMPL issue for OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging. While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22 subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs, where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well in repository-level debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures, EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

This fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP, a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop "Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool integration. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/MCP-Github-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[CFaults: Model-Based Diagnosis for Fault Localization in C Programs with Multiple Test Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09337v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks in software development. Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |

Their adoption requires systematic investigation to ensure responsible integration into curricula. Objective: This doctoral research aims to develop a validated framework for integrating LLMs into SE education through a multi-phase process, including taxonomies development, empirical investigation, and case studies. This paper presents the first empirical step. Method: We conducted a pilot repository mining study of 400 GitHub projects, analyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of motivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8] study. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits), software engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming assistance and debugging support (97 hits) were strongly represented. Demotivators, including plagiarism and IP concerns (385 hits), security, privacy and data integrity (87 hits), and over-reliance on AI in learning (39 hits), also appeared prominently. In contrast, demotivators such as challenges in evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded no hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical validation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes, highlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a comprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE education.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Developers' Self-Declaration of AI-Generated Code: An Analysis of Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16485v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers, who use them to assist in software development due to their capability to generate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 15 images, 8 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the dynamic data dependency of a step that reads a variable $v$ is challenging. It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An experience-based classification of quantum bugs in quantum software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03280v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However, the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong, which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that - unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic quantum debugging strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

| **[A Multi-stage Error Diagnosis for APB Transaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03554v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access, Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Repair of C Programs Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01947v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the repair of C programs. We present a framework that integrates spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT. This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has examined the quality of AI-generated code, little is known about how developers actually use these suggestions in real-world collaboration. We analyze 338 pull requests from 255 GitHub repositories containing self-admitted ChatGPT usage, including 645 AI-generated snippets and 3,486 developer-authored patches. We introduce PatchTrack, a tool that classifies whether ChatGPT patches were applied, not applied, or not suggested, enabling fine-grained analysis of AI-assisted decisions. Full adoption of ChatGPT code is rare: the median integration rate was 25%. A qualitative analysis of 89 pull requests with integrated patches revealed recurring patterns of structural integration, selective extraction, and iterative refinement, showing that developers typically treat ChatGPT's output as a starting point rather than a final implementation. Even when code was not directly adopted, ChatGPT influenced workflows through conceptual guidance, documentation, and debugging strategies. Integration decisions were shaped by scope, architectural fit, contributor role, and review norms. This study offers empirical insight into how generative AI is used in collaborative software development, showing that its impact extends beyond patch generation to broader decision-making. Our findings inform the design of AI-assisted tools, clarify patch adoption behavior, and support more transparent and effective use of LLMs in practice.</p></details> | 53 pages, 8 figures |

Therefore, effective and efficient debugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However, the teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in indirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer Science (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way. In this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging that interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance aims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper learning experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be integrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. We developed a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization techniques and large language models. Students can use features like the automated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and executed a small-scale, controlled experiment with eight undergraduate CS students. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the systematic guidance. They rated the automated setting of breakpoints as most effective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the breakpoint explanations. In future, we will extend our concept and implementation, and perform more intensive user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE-NIER 2025</p></details> |

Monitoring through logging a long-standing practice in traditional software offers a potential means for auditing ML applications, as logs provide traceable records of system behavior useful for debugging, performance analysis, and continuous auditing. systematically auditing models for compliance or accountability. The findings underscore the need for enhanced logging practices and tooling that systematically integrate responsible AI metrics. Such practices would support the development of auditable, transparent, and ethically responsible ML systems, aligning with growing regulatory requirements and societal expectations. By highlighting specific deficiencies and opportunities, this work provides actionable guidance for both practitioners and tool developers seeking to strengthen the accountability and trustworthiness of ML applications.</p></details> |  |

Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334v4)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025)</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

Existing agent-based methods often struggle to fully and accurately reproduce implementation details such as mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic. Previous studies show that reflection with explicit feedback improves agent performance. However, current paper reproduction methods fail to effectively adopt this strategy. This gap mainly arises from the diverse paper patterns, complex method modules, and varied configurations encountered in research papers. Motivated by how humans use systematic checklists to efficiently debug complex code, we propose \textbf{RePro}, a \textbf{Re}flective Paper-to-Code \textbf{Repro}duction framework that automatically extracts a paper's fingerprint, referring to a comprehensive set of accurate and atomic criteria serving as high-quality supervisory signals. The framework first generates code based on the extracted information, and then leverages the fingerprint within iterative verification and refinement loop. This approach systematically detects discrepancies and produces targeted revisions to align generated code with the paper's implementation details. Extensive experiments on the PaperBench Code-Dev benchmark have been conducted, RePro achieves 13.0\% performance gap over baselines, and it correctly revises complex logical and mathematical criteria in reflecting, on which the effectiveness is obvious.</p></details> |  |

This problem is especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems. Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations. These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes. Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely accessible to all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICWE 2025, Delft (30 June - 03 July 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defects4Log: Benchmarking LLMs for Logging Code Defect Detection and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11305v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniLLP: Enhancing LLM-based Log Level Prediction with Context-Aware Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08545v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8). Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy. Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally, our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and observability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07468v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceLens: Question-Driven Debugging for Taint Flow Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |

However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01215v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |

Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

This study benchmarks these four prominent LLMs on one hundred and fifty LeetCode problems across easy, medium, and hard difficulties, generating solutions in Java and Python. We evaluate each model based on execution time, memory usage, and algorithmic complexity, revealing significant performance differences. ChatGPT demonstrates consistent efficiency in execution time and memory usage, while Copilot and DeepSeek show variability as task complexity increases. Gemini, although effective on simpler tasks, requires more attempts as problem difficulty rises.

Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains.

In software engineering, many studies have focused on how LLMs support tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation. However, there has been limited focus on how full systems that integrate LLMs are tested during development. Aims: This study explores how LLM-powered systems are tested in the context of real-world application development. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 99 individual reports written by students who built and deployed LLM-powered applications as part of a university course. Each report was independently analyzed using thematic analysis, supported by a structured coding process. Results: Testing strategies combined manual and automated methods to evaluate both system logic and model behavior. Common practices included exploratory testing, unit testing, and prompt iteration. Reported challenges included integration failures, unpredictable outputs, prompt sensitivity, hallucinations, and uncertainty about correctness. Conclusions: Testing LLM-powered systems required adaptations to traditional verification methods, blending source-level reasoning with behavior-aware evaluations. These findings provide evidence on the practical context of testing generative components in software systems.</p></details> |  |

However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code. These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We experiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p></details> |  |

| **[PseudoBridge: Pseudo Code as the Bridge for Better Semantic and Logic Alignment in Code Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20881v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However, existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages. First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code. Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code retrieval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we show progress towards a basic, but portable, runtime environment for developing and executing hybrid quantum-classical programs running in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments enhanced with Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The middleware includes a second layer of scheduling after the main HPC resource manager in order to improve the utilization of the QPU, and extra functionality for observability, monitoring, and admin access. This approach enables managing multiple programming Software Development Kits (SDKs) as first-class citizens in the environment by building on a recently proposed vendor-neutral Quantum Resource Management Interface (QRMI). Lastly, we discuss and show a solution for the monitoring and observability stack, completing our description of the hybrid system architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, accepted to SFWM workshop at SC25</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Python Programming Education with an AI-Powered Code Helper: Design, Implementation, and Impact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20518v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Dual-Language General-Purpose Self-Hosted Visual Language and new Textual Programming Language for Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20426v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most visual programming languages (VPLs) are domain-specific, with few general-purpose VPLs like Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). These general-purpose VPLs are developed using textual programming languages and improving them requires textual programming. In this thesis, we designed and developed PWCT2, a dual-language (Arabic/English), general-purpose, self-hosting visual programming language. Before doing so, we specifically designed a textual programming language called Ring for its development. Ring is a dynamically typed language with a lightweight implementation, offering syntax customization features. It permits the creation of domain-specific languages through new features that extend object-oriented programming, allowing for specialized languages resembling Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or Supernova language. The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using the PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is composed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which increases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to develop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the development of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual programming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code generation and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also allows for the conversion of Ring code into visual code, enabling the creation of a self-hosting VPL that can be developed using itself. PWCT2 consists of approximately 92,000 lines of Ring code and comes with 394 visual components. PWCT2 is distributed to many users through the Steam platform and has received positive feedback, On Steam, 1772 users have launched the software, and the total recorded usage time exceeds 17,000 hours, encouraging further research and development.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

| **[Protocol Testing with I/O Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20308v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating software tests faces two fundamental problems. First, one needs to _generate inputs_ that are syntactically and semantically correct, yet sufficiently diverse to cover behavior. Second, one needs an _oracle_ to _check outputs_ whether a test case is correct or not. Both problems become apparent in _protocol testing_, where inputs are messages exchanged between parties, and outputs are the responses of these parties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protocol testing that combines input generation and output checking in a single framework. We introduce _I/O grammars_ as the first means to _completely_ specify the syntax and semantics of protocols, including messages, states, and interactions. Our implementation, based on the FANDANGO framework, takes a single I/O grammar, and can act as a _test generator_, as a _mock object_, and as an _oracle_ for a _client_, a _server_, or both (or actually any number of parties), a versatility not found in any existing tool or formalism. User-defined _constraints}_can have the generator focus on arbitrary protocol features; $k$-path guidance systematically covers states, messages, responses, and value alternatives in a unified fashion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several protocols, including DNS, FTP, and SMTP. We demonstrate that I/O grammars can specify advanced protocol features correctly and completely, while also enabling output validation of the programs under test. In its evaluation, we find that systematic coverage of the I/O grammar results in much quicker coverage of the input and response spaces (and thus functionality) compared to the random-based state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages |

This paper presents a methodology to formally verify the correctness of Stipula contracts through translation into Java code annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications. As a verification backend, the deductive verification tool KeY is used. Both, the translation and the verification of partial and total correctness for a large subset of Stipula contracts, those with disjoint cycles, is fully automatic. Our work demonstrates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool can be used successfully in a translation approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[V-GameGym: Visual Game Generation for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20136v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in programming tasks, yet current benchmarks primarily focus on single modality rather than visual game development. Most existing code-related benchmarks evaluate syntax correctness and execution accuracy, overlooking critical game-specific metrics such as playability, visual aesthetics, and user engagement that are essential for real-world deployment. To address the gap between current LLM capabilities in algorithmic problem-solving and competitive programming versus the comprehensive requirements of practical game development, we present V-GameGym, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,219 high-quality samples across 100 thematic clusters derived from real-world repositories, adopting a novel clustering-based curation methodology to ensure both diversity and structural completeness. Further, we introduce a multimodal evaluation framework with an automated LLM-driven pipeline for visual code synthesis using complete UI sandbox environments. Our extensive analysis reveals that V-GameGym effectively bridges the gap between code generation accuracy and practical game development workflows, providing quantifiable quality metrics for visual programming and interactive element generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v6)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural network (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Language Barriers: Multi-Agent Coordination for Multi-Language Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19918v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Producing high-quality code across multiple programming languages is increasingly important as today's software systems are built on heterogeneous stacks. Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the state of automated programming, yet their proficiency varies sharply between languages, especially those with limited training data such as Rust, Perl, OCaml, and Erlang. Many current solutions including language-specific fine-tuning, multi-agent orchestration, transfer learning, and intermediate-representation pipelines still approach each target language in isolation, missing opportunities to share knowledge or exploit recurring cross-language patterns. XL-CoGen tackles this challenge with a coordinated multi-agent architecture that integrates intermediate representation, code generation, translation, and automated repair. Its distinguishing feature is a data-driven mechanism for selecting bridging languages: empirically derived transfer matrices identify the best intermediate languages based on demonstrated translation success rather than raw generation accuracy. The system performs early output validation, iteratively corrects errors, and reuses intermediate artifacts as contextual scaffolds for subsequent translations. Extensive experiments show that XL-CoGen yields notable improvements with 13 percentage-point gains over the strongest fine-tuned baseline and as much as 30 percentage points over existing single-language multi-agent methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate that compatibility-guided bridging significantly outperforms LLM-based heuristics, confirming the value of cumulative cross-language knowledge transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Code Semantics Help? A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025-findings https://openreview.net/forum?id=d4ICISW2T4</p></details> |
| **[Hornet Node and the Hornet DSL: A Minimal, Executable Specification for Bitcoin Consensus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15754v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bitcoin's consensus rules are encoded in the implementation of its reference client: "The code is the spec." Yet this code is unsuitable for formal verification due to side effects, mutable state, concurrency, and legacy design. A standalone formal specification would enable verification both across versions of the reference client and against new client implementations, strengthening decentralization by reducing the risk of consensus-splitting bugs. Yet such a specification has long been considered intractable given the complexity of Bitcoin's consensus logic. We demonstrate a compact, executable, declarative C++ specification of Bitcoin consensus rules that syncs mainnet to tip in a few hours on a single thread. We also introduce the Hornet Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to encode these rules unambiguously for execution, enabling formal reasoning, consensus code generation, and AI-driven adversarial testing. Our spec-driven client Hornet Node offers a modern and modular complement to the reference client. Its clear, idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns, supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Repair of Ambiguous Problem Descriptions for LLM-Based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07270v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the importance of natural language (NL) in software engineering. However, ambiguity of NL can harm software quality, as unclear problem descriptions may lead to incorrect program generation. Detecting and resolving such ambiguity is challenging, motivating our introduction of the automated repair of ambiguous NL descriptions, which we approach by reducing code generation uncertainty and better aligning NL with input-output examples. Ambiguity repair is difficult for LLMs because they must understand how their interpretation of a description changes when the text is altered. We find that directly prompting LLMs to clarify ambiguity often produces irrelevant or inconsistent edits. To address this, we decompose this task into two simpler steps: (1) analyzing and repairing the LLM's interpretation of the description - captured by the distribution of programs it induces - using traditional testing and program repair, and (2) refining the description based on distribution changes via a method we call contrastive specification inference. We implement this approach in a tool called SpecFix and evaluate it using four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct) on three popular code generation benchmarks (HumanEval+, MBPP+ and LiveCodeBench). Without human intervention or external information, SpecFix modified 43.58% of descriptions, improving Pass@1 on the modified set by 30.9%. This yields a 4.09% absolute improvement across the entire benchmark. Repairs also transfer across models: descriptions repaired for one model improve other models' performance by 10.48%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Reuse All You Need? A Systematic Comparison of Regular Expression Composition Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20579v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composing regexes is a common but challenging engineering activity. Software engineers struggle with regex complexity, leading to defects, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. Researchers have proposed tools to synthesize regexes automatically, and recent advances in LLMs have also shown promise in generating regexes. Meanwhile, developers commonly reuse existing regexes from codebases and internet sources. No work to date has compared these various regex composition strategies, leaving software engineers unaware about which to use and researchers uncertain about open problems. We address this gap through a systematic evaluation of regex reuse, formal synthesis, and LLM-based generation strategies. We curate a novel dataset of 901,516 regexes mined from open-source software projects and internet sources (RegexReuseDB), accompanied by a set of 55,448 regex composition tasks defined by a target regex and its corresponding positive and negative string pairs (RegexCompBench). To address the absence of an automated regex reuse formulation, we design and implement reuse-by-example, the first programming by example approach that leverages RegexReuseDB. Our evaluation then benchmarks reuse-by-example, formal synthesizers, and LLMs on many aspects of interest to software engineers, including accuracy, maintainability, computational efficiency, and result diversity. Although all three approaches solve most composition tasks accurately, only reuse-by-example and LLMs excel over the range of metrics we applied, and reuse-by-example in particular offers engineers the variance in candidates that they say they find helpful. Ceteris paribus, prefer the cheaper solution--for regex composition, perhaps reuse is all you need. Our findings provide insights for developers selecting regex composition strategies and inform the design of tools to improve regex reliability in software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clotho: Measuring Task-Specific Pre-Generation Test Adequacy for LLM Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17314v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software increasingly relies on the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), from natural language understanding to program analysis and generation. Yet testing them on specific tasks remains difficult and costly: many prompts lack ground truth, forcing reliance on human judgment, while existing uncertainty and adequacy measures typically require full inference. A key challenge is to assess input adequacy in a way that reflects the demands of the task, ideally before even generating any output. We introduce CLOTHO, a task-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty directly from hidden LLM states. Given a large pool of unlabelled inputs for a specific task, CLOTHO uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to adaptively sample the most informative cases for human labelling. Based on this reference set the GMM can then rank unseen inputs by their likelihood of failure. In our empirical evaluation across eight benchmark tasks and three open-weight LLMs, CLOTHO can predict failures with a ROC-AUC of 0.716, after labelling reference sets that are on average only 5.4% of inputs. It does so without generating any outputs, thereby reducing costs compared to existing uncertainty measures. Comparison of CLOTHO and post-generation uncertainty measures shows that the two approaches complement each other. Crucially, we show that adequacy scores learnt from open-weight LLMs transfer effectively to proprietary models, extending the applicability of the approach. When prioritising test inputs for proprietary models, CLOTHO increases the average number of failing inputs from 18.7 to 42.5 out of 100, compared to random prioritisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Insertion of Flushes and Fences for Persistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19459v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CXL shared memory and persistent memory allow the contents of memory to persist beyond crashes. Stores to persistent or CXL memory are typically not immediately made persistent; developers must manually flush the corresponding cache lines to force the data to be written to the underlying storage. Correctly using flush and fence operations is known to be challenging. While state-of-the-art tools can find missing flush instructions, they often require bug-revealing test cases. No existing tools can ensure the absence of missing flush bugs. In this paper, we present PMRobust, a compiler that automatically inserts flush and fence operations to ensure that code using persistent memory is free from missing flush and fence bugs. PMRobust employs a novel static analysis with optimizations that target newly allocated objects. We have evaluated PMRobust on persistent memory libraries and several persistent memory data structures and measured a geometric mean overhead of 0.26% relative to the original benchmarks with hand-placed flush and fence operations.</p></details> |  |

We fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model with two RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49%, both beating all general-purpose baselines; on the original HumanEval they score 65.90% and 63.00%. GRPO performs well on basic tasks (44/78) and excels on intermediate ones (41/68), but neither GRPO nor ORPO solves any of the five advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted quantum programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Mutation Based Differential Testing for FPGA Logic Synthesis Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17713v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) play a crucial role in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) applications, which have been widely used in safety-critical environments, including aerospace, chip manufacturing, and medical devices. A critical step in FPGA development is logic synthesis, which enables developers to translate their software designs into hardware net lists, which facilitates the physical implementation of the chip, detailed timing and power analysis, gate-level simulation, test vector generation, and optimization and consistency checking. However, bugs or incorrect implementations in FPGA logic synthesis compilers may lead to unexpected behaviors in target wapplications, posing security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate such bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. The effectiveness of existing works is still limited by its simple, blind mutation strategy. To address this challenge, we propose a guided mutation strategy based on Bayesian optimization called LSC-Fuzz to detect bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. Specifically, LSC-Fuzz consists of three components: the test-program generation component, the Bayesian diversity selection component, and the equivalent check component. By performing test-program generation and Bayesian diversity selection, LSC-Fuzz generates diverse and complex HDL code, thoroughly testing the FPGA logic synthesis compilers using equivalent check to detect bugs. Through three months, LSC-Fuzz has found 16 bugs, 12 of these has been confirmed by official technical support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Petri Nets-based Methods on Automatically Detecting for Concurrency Bugs in Rust Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02754v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rust's memory safety guarantees, notably ownership and lifetime systems, have driven its widespread adoption. Concurrency bugs still occur in Rust programs, and existing detection approaches exhibit significant limitations: static analyzers suffer from context insensitivity and high false positives, while dynamic methods incur prohibitive runtime costs due to exponential path exploration. This paper presents a Petri net-based method for efficient, precise detection of Rust concurrency bugs. The method rests on three pillars: (1) A syntax-preserving program-to-Petri-net transformation tailored for target bug classes; (2) Semantics-preserving state compression via context-aware slicing; (3) Bug detection through efficient Petri net reachability analysis. The core innovation is its rigorous, control-flow-driven modeling of Rust's ownership semantics and synchronization primitives within the Petri net structure, with data operations represented as token movements. Integrated pointer analysis automates alias identification during transformation. Experiments on standard Rust concurrency benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods LockBud and Miri that are both tools of detecting concurrency bugs of Rust programs. Compared to LockBud, our approach reduces false positives by 35.7\% and false negatives by 28.3\% , which is obtained through our precise flow-sensitive pointer analysis. Compared with Miri that is a dynamic analysis tool, although Miri can obtain the same detection results, our method achieves 100% faster verification speed since our method takes a state reduce algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Gaming and esports are key areas influenced by the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions at scale. Tooling simplifies scientific workloads and is essential for developing the gaming and esports research area. In this work, we present ``SC2Tools'', a toolset containing multiple submodules responsible for working with, and producing larger datasets. We provide a modular structure of the implemented tooling, leaving room for future extensions where needed. Additionally, some of the tools are not StarCraft~2 exclusive and can be used with other types of data for dataset creation. The tools we present were leveraged in creating one of the largest StarCraft~2 tournament datasets to date with a separate PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning application programming interface (API) for easy access to the data. We conclude that alleviating the burden of data collection, preprocessing, and custom code development is essential for less technically proficient researchers to engage in the growing gaming and esports research area. Finally, our solution provides some foundational work toward normalizing experiment workflow in StarCraft~2</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnosing Violations of State-based Specifications in iCFTL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17776v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As modern software systems grow in complexity and operate in dynamic environments, the need for runtime analysis techniques becomes a more critical part of the verification and validation process. Runtime verification monitors the runtime system behaviour by checking whether an execution trace - a sequence of recorded events - satisfies a given specification, yielding a Boolean or quantitative verdict. However, when a specification is violated, such a verdict is often insufficient to understand why the violation happened. To fill this gap, diagnostics approaches aim to produce more informative verdicts. In this paper, we address the problem of generating informative verdicts for violated Inter-procedural Control-Flow Temporal Logic (iCFTL) specifications that express constraints over program variable values. We propose a diagnostic approach based on backward data-flow analysis to statically determine the relevant statements contributing to the specification violation. Using this analysis, we instrument the program to produce enriched execution traces. Using the enriched execution traces, we perform the runtime analysis and identify the statements whose execution led to the specification violation. We implemented our approach in a prototype tool, iCFTL-Diagnostics, and evaluated it on 112 specifications across 10 software projects. Our tool achieves 90% precision in identifying relevant statements for 100 of the 112 specifications. It reduces the number of lines that have to be inspected for diagnosing a violation by at least 90%. In terms of computational cost, iCFTL-Diagnostics generates a diagnosis within 7 min, and requires no more than 25 MB of memory. The instrumentation required to support diagnostics incurs an execution time overhead of less than 30% and a memory overhead below 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic AI for Software: thoughts from Software Engineering community](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17343v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt. At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team. Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents. Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Traditional static slicing tools rely on parsing complete source code, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios where code snippets are incomplete or unparsable. While recent research developed learning-based approaches to predict slices, they face critical challenges: (1) Inaccurate dependency identification, where models fail to precisely capture data and control dependencies between code elements; and (2) Unconstrained generation, where models produce slices with extraneous or hallucinated tokens not present in the input, violating the structural integrity of slices. To address these challenges, we propose \ourtool, a novel slicing framework that reformulates static program slicing as a sequence-to-sequence task using lightweight language models (e.g., CodeT5+). Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we introduce a copy mechanism that enables the model to more accurately capture inter-element dependencies and directly copy relevant tokens from the input, improving both dependency reasoning and generation constraint. Second, we design a constrained decoding process with (a) lexical constraint, restricting outputs to input tokens only, and (b) syntactic constraint, leveraging Tree Similarity of Edit Distance (TSED) monotonicity to detect structurally invalid outputs and discard them.

Although language models (LMs) have attracted interest for this task due to their vast latent knowledge and reasoning potential, their practical adoption has been limited. The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of deep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging larger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize cost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input generation. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question construction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based post-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a fuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics during fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design enables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much larger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\% higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.</p></details> |  |

We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v4)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACCeLLiuM: Supervised Fine-Tuning for Automated OpenACC Pragma Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20380v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is still required in order to use those directives effectively. We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops, along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops, and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models, and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU offloading of serially written programs.</p></details> |  |

Copilot for API Misuse Detection and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16795v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>API misuse introduces security vulnerabilities, system failures, and increases maintenance costs, all of which remain critical challenges in software development. Existing detection approaches rely on static analysis or machine learning-based tools that operate post-development, which delays defect resolution. Delayed defect resolution can significantly increase the cost and complexity of maintenance and negatively impact software reliability and user trust. AI-powered code assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, offer the potential for real-time API misuse detection within development environments. This study evaluates GitHub Copilot's effectiveness in identifying and correcting API misuse using MUBench, which provides a curated benchmark of misuse cases. We construct 740 misuse examples, manually and via AI-assisted variants, using correct usage patterns and misuse specifications. These examples and 147 correct usage cases are analyzed using Copilot integrated in Visual Studio Code. Copilot achieved a detection accuracy of 86.2%, precision of 91.2%, and recall of 92.4%. It performed strongly on common misuse types (e.g., missing-call, null-check) but struggled with compound or context-sensitive cases. Notably, Copilot successfully fixed over 95% of the misuses it identified. These findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of AI-driven coding assistants, positioning Copilot as a promising tool for real-time pair programming and detecting and fixing API misuses during software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 35th IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Advances in Software Computing</p></details> |

However, their adoption remains limited by high computational costs, among other factors. Small Language Models (SLMs) present a lightweight alternative. While LLMs have been evaluated on competitive programming tasks, prior work often emphasizes metrics like Elo or pass rates, neglecting failure analysis. The potential of SLMs in this space remains underexplored. In this study, we benchmark three open SLMs - Llama-3.2-3B, Gemma-3-12B, and Phi-4-14B - across 280 Codeforces problems spanning Elo ratings from 800 to 2100 and covering 36 distinct topics. All models were tasked with generating Python solutions. Phi-4-14B achieved the best SLM performance with a pass@3 of 63.6%, nearing o3-mini-high (86.8%). Combining Python and C++ outputs increased Phi-4-14B's pass@6 to 73.6%. A qualitative analysis revealed some failures stemmed from minor implementation issues rather than reasoning flaws.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |

We analyze incentives and outcomes in Google's Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP), one of the world's largest bug bounty programs. We analyze the responsiveness of the quality and quantity of bugs received to changes in payments, focusing on a change in Google's reward amounts posted in July, 2024, in which reward amounts increased by up to 200% for the highest impact tier. Our empirical results show an increase in the volume of high-value bugs received after the reward increase, for which we also compute elasticities. We further break down the sources of this increase between veteran researchers and new researchers, showing that the reward increase both redirected the attention of veteran researchers and attracted new top security researchers into the program.</p></details> |  |

Rethinking Output Validation in Quantum Program Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16595v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computing continues to emerge, ensuring the quality of quantum programs has become increasingly critical. Quantum program testing has emerged as a prominent research area within the scope of quantum software engineering. While numerous approaches have been proposed to address quantum program quality assurance, our analysis reveals that most existing methods rely on measurement-based validation in practice. However, due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum programs, measurement-based validation methods face significant limitations. To investigate these limitations, we conducted an empirical study of recent research on quantum program testing, analyzing measurement-based validation methods in the literature. Our analysis categorizes existing measurement-based validation methods into two groups: distribution-level validation and output-value-level validation. We then compare measurement-based validation with statevector-based validation methods to evaluate their pros and cons. Our findings demonstrate that measurement-based validation is suitable for straightforward assessments, such as verifying the existence of specific output values, while statevector-based validation proves more effective for complicated tasks such as assessing the program behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be appeared in the proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025), NIER track, Seoul, South Korea, November 16 -20, 2025</p></details> |
| **[PrediPrune: Reducing Verification Overhead in Souper with Machine Learning Driven Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16497v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Souper is a powerful enumerative superoptimizer that enhances the runtime performance of programs by optimizing LLVM intermediate representation (IR) code. However, its verification process, which relies on a computationally expensive SMT solver to validate optimization candidates, must explore a large search space. This large search space makes the verification process particularly expensive, increasing the burden to incorporate Souper into compilation tools. We propose PrediPrune, a stochastic candidate pruning strategy that effectively reduces the number of invalid candidates passed to the SMT solver. By utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the validity of candidates based on features extracted from the code, PrediPrune prunes unlikely candidates early, decreasing the verification workload. When combined with the state-of-the-art approach (Dataflow), PrediPrune decreases compilation time by 51% compared to the Baseline and by 12% compared to using only Dataflow, emphasizing the effectiveness of the combined approach that integrates a purely ML-based method (PrediPrune) with a purely non-ML based (Dataflow) method. Additionally, PrediPrune offers a flexible interface to trade-off compilation time and optimization opportunities, allowing end users to adjust the balance according to their needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[EquiBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Reasoning about Program Semantics via Equivalence Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12466v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integral to code-related tasks, a central question emerges: Do LLMs truly understand program semantics? We introduce EquiBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs through equivalence checking, i.e., determining whether two programs produce identical outputs for all possible inputs. Unlike prior code generation benchmarks, this task directly tests a model's ability to reason about program semantics. EquiBench consists of 2400 program pairs across four languages and six categories. These pairs are generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, ensuring high-confidence labels, nontrivial difficulty, and full automation. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that in the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 63.8% and 76.2%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline. Further analysis reveals that models often rely on syntactic similarity rather than exhibiting robust reasoning about program semantics, highlighting current limitations.

| **[MatchFixAgent: Language-Agnostic Autonomous Repository-Level Code Translation Validation and Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16187v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms source code from one programming language (PL) to another. Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |

However, these capabilities are still limited compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model, such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.</p></details> | 22 pages |

However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code. These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We experiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p></details> |  |

Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling, Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%, respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions, i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual developers and vendors are needed.</p></details> |  |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with students.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |

To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.</p></details> |  |

However, energy estimates during DL training often rely on unverified assumptions. This work addresses that gap by investigating how model architecture and training environment affect energy consumption. We train a variety of computer vision models and collect energy consumption and accuracy metrics to analyze their trade-offs across configurations. Our results show that selecting the right model-training environment combination can reduce training energy consumption by up to 80.68% with less than 2% loss in $F_1$ score. We find a significant interaction effect between model and training environment: energy efficiency improves when GPU computational power scales with model complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that common estimation practices, such as using FLOPs or GPU TDP, fail to capture these dynamics and can lead to substantial errors. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Stable Training Epoch Projection (STEP) and the Pre-training Regression-based Estimation (PRE) methods. Across evaluations, our methods outperform existing tools by a factor of two or more in estimation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 10 figures, under review in Computer Standards & Interfaces journal.

| **[PseudoBridge: Pseudo Code as the Bridge for Better Semantic and Logic Alignment in Code Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20881v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However, existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages. First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code. Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verification Limits Code LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20837v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification, we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Exploring Engagement in Hybrid Meetings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20780v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices, introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks, employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics. Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Issue Types in Open Source Blockchain-based Software Projects with the Transformer-based BERTopic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11451v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain-based software systems are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, yet a systematic understanding of their development challenges remains limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of 497,742 issues mined from 1,209 open-source blockchain projects hosted on GitHub. Employing BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, we identify 49 distinct issue topics and organize them hierarchically into 11 major subcategories. Our analysis reveals that both general software development issues and blockchain-specific concerns are nearly equally represented, with Wallet Management and UI Enhancement emerging as the most prominent topics. We further examine the temporal evolution of issue categories and resolution times, finding that Wallet issues not only dominate in frequency but also exhibit the longest resolution time. Conversely, Mechanisms issues are resolved significantly faster. Issue frequency surged after 2016 with the rise of Ethereum and decentralized applications, but started declining after 2022. These findings enhance our understanding of blockchain software maintenance, informing the development of specialized tools and practices to improve robustness and maintainability.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel programming language topic classification workflow. Our approach combines a multi-label Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a sliding window and voting strategy to enable fine-grained localization of core language concepts such as operator overloading, virtual functions, inheritance, and templates. Trained on the IBM Project CodeNet dataset, our model achieves an average F1 score of 0.90 across topics and 0.75 in code-topic highlight. Our findings contribute empirical insights and a reusable pipeline for researchers and practitioners interested in code analysis and data-driven software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we show progress towards a basic, but portable, runtime environment for developing and executing hybrid quantum-classical programs running in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments enhanced with Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The middleware includes a second layer of scheduling after the main HPC resource manager in order to improve the utilization of the QPU, and extra functionality for observability, monitoring, and admin access. This approach enables managing multiple programming Software Development Kits (SDKs) as first-class citizens in the environment by building on a recently proposed vendor-neutral Quantum Resource Management Interface (QRMI). Lastly, we discuss and show a solution for the monitoring and observability stack, completing our description of the hybrid system architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, accepted to SFWM workshop at SC25</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Python Programming Education with an AI-Powered Code Helper: Design, Implementation, and Impact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20518v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[PromptDebt: A Comprehensive Study of Technical Debt Across LLM Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20497v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software via APIs like OpenAI, offering powerful AI features without heavy infrastructure. Yet these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD). In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142 Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Proceedings of the 2025 Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE '25)</p></details> |
| **[AI-Specific Code Smells: From Specification to Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20491v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code), achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).</p></details> |  |

We conducted a mixed-methods case study in NAV IT, a large public sector agile organization. We analyzed 26,317 unique non-merge commits from 703 of NAV IT's GitHub repositories over a two-year period, focusing on commit-based activity metrics from 25 Copilot users and 14 non-users. The analysis was complemented by survey responses on their roles and perceived productivity, as well as 13 interviews. Our analysis of activity metrics revealed that individuals who used Copilot were consistently more active than non-users, even prior to Copilot's introduction. We did not find any statistically significant changes in commit-based activity for Copilot users after they adopted the tool, although minor increases were observed. This suggests a discrepancy between changes in commit-based metrics and the subjective experience of productivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 59th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Dual-Language General-Purpose Self-Hosted Visual Language and new Textual Programming Language for Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20426v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most visual programming languages (VPLs) are domain-specific, with few general-purpose VPLs like Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). These general-purpose VPLs are developed using textual programming languages and improving them requires textual programming. In this thesis, we designed and developed PWCT2, a dual-language (Arabic/English), general-purpose, self-hosting visual programming language. Before doing so, we specifically designed a textual programming language called Ring for its development. Ring is a dynamically typed language with a lightweight implementation, offering syntax customization features. It permits the creation of domain-specific languages through new features that extend object-oriented programming, allowing for specialized languages resembling Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or Supernova language. The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using the PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is composed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which increases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to develop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the development of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual programming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code generation and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also allows for the conversion of Ring code into visual code, enabling the creation of a self-hosting VPL that can be developed using itself. PWCT2 consists of approximately 92,000 lines of Ring code and comes with 394 visual components. PWCT2 is distributed to many users through the Steam platform and has received positive feedback, On Steam, 1772 users have launched the software, and the total recorded usage time exceeds 17,000 hours, encouraging further research and development.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Advancing Expert Specialization for Better MoE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22323v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per input. However, we observe that the commonly used auxiliary load balancing loss often leads to expert overlap and overly uniform routing, which hinders expert specialization and degrades overall performance during post-training. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective solution that introduces two complementary objectives: (1) an orthogonality loss to encourage experts to process distinct types of tokens, and (2) a variance loss to encourage more discriminative routing decisions. Gradient-level analysis demonstrates that these objectives are compatible with the existing auxiliary loss and contribute to optimizing the training process. Experimental results over various model architectures and across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly enhances expert specialization. Notably, our method improves classic MoE baselines with auxiliary loss by up to 23.79%, while also maintaining load balancing in downstream tasks, without any architectural modifications or additional components. We will release our code to contribute to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>33pag...</summary><p>33pages, 6figures(Accepted by Neurips 2026 Oral)</p></details> |

| **[Protocol Testing with I/O Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20308v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating software tests faces two fundamental problems. First, one needs to _generate inputs_ that are syntactically and semantically correct, yet sufficiently diverse to cover behavior. Second, one needs an _oracle_ to _check outputs_ whether a test case is correct or not. Both problems become apparent in _protocol testing_, where inputs are messages exchanged between parties, and outputs are the responses of these parties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protocol testing that combines input generation and output checking in a single framework. We introduce _I/O grammars_ as the first means to _completely_ specify the syntax and semantics of protocols, including messages, states, and interactions. Our implementation, based on the FANDANGO framework, takes a single I/O grammar, and can act as a _test generator_, as a _mock object_, and as an _oracle_ for a _client_, a _server_, or both (or actually any number of parties), a versatility not found in any existing tool or formalism. User-defined _constraints}_can have the generator focus on arbitrary protocol features; $k$-path guidance systematically covers states, messages, responses, and value alternatives in a unified fashion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several protocols, including DNS, FTP, and SMTP. We demonstrate that I/O grammars can specify advanced protocol features correctly and completely, while also enabling output validation of the programs under test. In its evaluation, we find that systematic coverage of the I/O grammar results in much quicker coverage of the input and response spaces (and thus functionality) compared to the random-based state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages |

This paper introduces a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based approach for the verifiable execution of business processes while preserving confidentiality. We integrate ZK virtual machines (zkVMs) into business process management engines through a comprehensive system architecture and a prototypical implementation. Our approach supports chained verifiable computations through proof compositions. On the example of product carbon footprinting, we model sequential footprinting activities and demonstrate how organizations can prove and verify the integrity of verifiable processes without exposing sensitive information. We assess different ZKP proving variants within process models for their efficiency in proving and verifying, and discuss the practical integration of ZKPs throughout the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle. Our experiment-driven evaluation demonstrates the automation of process verification under given confidentiality constraints.</p></details> |  |

While sampling techniques improve pass@k metrics, hardware engineers need one trustworthy solution rather than uncertain candidates. To bridge this gap, we formulate it as a semantic alignment problem between requirements and Verilog implementations, and propose VCD-RNK, a discriminator model tailored for efficient Verilog code reranking. Specifically, VCD-RNKincorporates Verilog-specific reasoning by distilling expert knowledge across three dimensions: code semantic analysis, test case generation, and functional correctness assessment. By explicitly simulating the above reasoning processes during inference, VCD-RNK effectively avoids computationally intensive test execution in existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

In order to address this, we present a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models were able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2nd ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software, Benchmark & Dataset Track (AIware '25)</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study of Testing Practices in Open Source AI Agent Frameworks and Agentic Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19185v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation model (FM)-based AI agents are rapidly gaining adoption across diverse domains, but their inherent non-determinism and non-reproducibility pose testing and quality assurance challenges. While recent benchmarks provide task-level evaluations, there is limited understanding of how developers verify the internal correctness of these agents during development. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of testing practices in the AI agent ecosystem, analyzing 39 open-source agent frameworks and 439 agentic applications. We identify ten distinct testing patterns and find that novel, agent-specific methods like DeepEval are seldom used (around 1%), while traditional patterns like negative and membership testing are widely adapted to manage FM uncertainty. By mapping these patterns to canonical architectural components of agent frameworks and agentic applications, we uncover a fundamental inversion of testing effort: deterministic components like Resource Artifacts (tools) and Coordination Artifacts (workflows) consume over 70% of testing effort, while the FM-based Plan Body receives less than 5%. Crucially, this reveals a critical blind spot, as the Trigger component (prompts) remains neglected, appearing in around 1% of all tests. Our findings offer the first empirical testing baseline in FM-based agent frameworks and agentic applications, revealing a rational but incomplete adaptation to non-determinism. To address it, framework developers should improve support for novel testing methods, application developers must adopt prompt regression testing, and researchers should explore barriers to adoption. Strengthening these practices is vital for building more robust and dependable AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Requirement Traceability through Data Augmentation Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20149v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements traceability is crucial in software engineering to ensure consistency between requirements and code. However, existing automated traceability methods are constrained by the scarcity of training data and challenges in bridging the semantic gap between artifacts. This study aims to address the data scarcity problem in requirements traceability by employing large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation. We propose a novel approach that utilizes prompt-based techniques with LLMs to generate augmented requirement-to-code trace links, thereby enhancing the training dataset. Four LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) were used, employing both zero-shot and few-shot templates. Moreover, we optimized the encoder component of the tracing model to improve its efficiency and adaptability to augmented data. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) proposing and evaluating four prompt templates for data augmentation; (2) providing a comparative analysis of four LLMs for generating trace links; (3) enhancing the model's encoder for improved adaptability to augmented datasets. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances model performance, achieving an F1 score improvement of up to 28.59%, thus demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for practical application.</p></details> |  |

Most existing code-related benchmarks evaluate syntax correctness and execution accuracy, overlooking critical game-specific metrics such as playability, visual aesthetics, and user engagement that are essential for real-world deployment. To address the gap between current LLM capabilities in algorithmic problem-solving and competitive programming versus the comprehensive requirements of practical game development, we present V-GameGym, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,219 high-quality samples across 100 thematic clusters derived from real-world repositories, adopting a novel clustering-based curation methodology to ensure both diversity and structural completeness. Further, we introduce a multimodal evaluation framework with an automated LLM-driven pipeline for visual code synthesis using complete UI sandbox environments. Our extensive analysis reveals that V-GameGym effectively bridges the gap between code generation accuracy and practical game development workflows, providing quantifiable quality metrics for visual programming and interactive element generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v6)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural network (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |

We believe that dynamic, secure monitoring of the IIoT environment can be achieved through integration with the Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Digital Twin (DT) paradigms. The current literature lacks implementation details for SDN-based DT and time-aware intelligent model training for short-term anomaly detection against IIoT threats. Therefore, we have proposed a novel framework for short-term anomaly detection that uses an SDN-based DT. Using a comprehensive dataset, time-aware labeling of features, and a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning models, we propose a novel SD-TWIN-based anomaly detection algorithm. According to the performance of a new real-time SD-TWIN deployment, the GPU- accelerated LightGBM model is particularly effective, achieving a balance of high recall and strong classification performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE Globecom Workshops-TwinNetApp</p></details> |

The open-source community has witnessed a rapid influx of neural network (NN) repositories with fast-paced iterations, making it crucial for practitioners to analyze their evolution to guide development and stay ahead of trends. While extensive research has explored traditional software evolution using Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), these are ill-suited for NN software, which relies on pre-defined modules and pre-trained models (PTMs) with distinct component structures and reuse patterns. Conceptual AI Bills of Materials (AIBOMs) also lack practical implementations for large-scale evolutionary analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce the Neural Network Bill of Material (NNBOM), a comprehensive dataset construct tailored for NN software. We create a large-scale NNBOM database from 55,997 curated PyTorch GitHub repositories, cataloging their TPLs, PTMs, and modules. Leveraging this database, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of neural network software evolution across software scale, component reuse, and inter-domain dependency, providing maintainers and developers with a holistic view of its long-term trends. Building on these findings, we develop two prototype applications, \textit{Multi repository Evolution Analyzer} and \textit{Single repository Component Assessor and Recommender}, to demonstrate the practical value of our analysis.</p></details> | 11pages,8figures |
| **[Beyond Language Barriers: Multi-Agent Coordination for Multi-Language Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19918v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Producing high-quality code across multiple programming languages is increasingly important as today's software systems are built on heterogeneous stacks. Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the state of automated programming, yet their proficiency varies sharply between languages, especially those with limited training data such as Rust, Perl, OCaml, and Erlang. Many current solutions including language-specific fine-tuning, multi-agent orchestration, transfer learning, and intermediate-representation pipelines still approach each target language in isolation, missing opportunities to share knowledge or exploit recurring cross-language patterns. XL-CoGen tackles this challenge with a coordinated multi-agent architecture that integrates intermediate representation, code generation, translation, and automated repair. Its distinguishing feature is a data-driven mechanism for selecting bridging languages: empirically derived transfer matrices identify the best intermediate languages based on demonstrated translation success rather than raw generation accuracy. The system performs early output validation, iteratively corrects errors, and reuses intermediate artifacts as contextual scaffolds for subsequent translations. Extensive experiments show that XL-CoGen yields notable improvements with 13 percentage-point gains over the strongest fine-tuned baseline and as much as 30 percentage points over existing single-language multi-agent methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate that compatibility-guided bridging significantly outperforms LLM-based heuristics, confirming the value of cumulative cross-language knowledge transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online-Optimized RAG for Tool Use and Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20415v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities. Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Traffic Accident Detection Using Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19096v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response. Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of accidents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in accident identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi-object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2025.

| **[Do Code Semantics Help? A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025-findings https://openreview.net/forum?id=d4ICISW2T4</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Metacognition: Designing a "Self-Aware" Low-Code Agent for Failure Prediction and Human Handoff](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19783v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection, this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key directions for future research.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 tables |

Yet this code is unsuitable for formal verification due to side effects, mutable state, concurrency, and legacy design. A standalone formal specification would enable verification both across versions of the reference client and against new client implementations, strengthening decentralization by reducing the risk of consensus-splitting bugs. Yet such a specification has long been considered intractable given the complexity of Bitcoin's consensus logic. We demonstrate a compact, executable, declarative C++ specification of Bitcoin consensus rules that syncs mainnet to tip in a few hours on a single thread. We also introduce the Hornet Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to encode these rules unambiguously for execution, enabling formal reasoning, consensus code generation, and AI-driven adversarial testing. Our spec-driven client Hornet Node offers a modern and modular complement to the reference client. Its clear, idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns, supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.</p></details> |  |

Over one year, 300 engineers across multiple teams integrated an in-house AI platform (DeputyDev) that combines code generation and automated review capabilities into their daily workflows. Through rigorous cohort analysis, our study demonstrates statistically significant productivity improvements, including an overall 31.8% reduction in PR review cycle time. Developer adoption was strong, with 85% satisfaction for code review features and 93% expressing a desire to continue using the platform. Adoption patterns showed systematic scaling from 4% engagement in month 1 to 83% peak usage by month 6, stabilizing at 60% active engagement. Top adopters achieved a 61% increase in code volume pushed to production, contributing to approximately 30 to 40% of code shipped to production through this tool, accounting for an overall 28% increase in code shipment volume. Unlike controlled benchmark evaluations, our longitudinal analysis provides empirical evidence from production environments, revealing both the transformative potential and practical deployment challenges of integrating AI into enterprise software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Automated Repair of Ambiguous Problem Descriptions for LLM-Based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07270v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the importance of natural language (NL) in software engineering. However, ambiguity of NL can harm software quality, as unclear problem descriptions may lead to incorrect program generation. Detecting and resolving such ambiguity is challenging, motivating our introduction of the automated repair of ambiguous NL descriptions, which we approach by reducing code generation uncertainty and better aligning NL with input-output examples. Ambiguity repair is difficult for LLMs because they must understand how their interpretation of a description changes when the text is altered. We find that directly prompting LLMs to clarify ambiguity often produces irrelevant or inconsistent edits. To address this, we decompose this task into two simpler steps: (1) analyzing and repairing the LLM's interpretation of the description - captured by the distribution of programs it induces - using traditional testing and program repair, and (2) refining the description based on distribution changes via a method we call contrastive specification inference. We implement this approach in a tool called SpecFix and evaluate it using four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct) on three popular code generation benchmarks (HumanEval+, MBPP+ and LiveCodeBench). Without human intervention or external information, SpecFix modified 43.58% of descriptions, improving Pass@1 on the modified set by 30.9%. This yields a 4.09% absolute improvement across the entire benchmark. Repairs also transfer across models: descriptions repaired for one model improve other models' performance by 10.48%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assertion Messages with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19673v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assertion messages significantly enhance unit tests by clearly explaining the reasons behind test failures, yet they are frequently omitted by developers and automated test-generation tools. Despite recent advancements, Large Language Models (LLMs) have not been systematically evaluated for their ability to generate informative assertion messages. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation of four state-of-the-art Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) LLMs - Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, Codestral-22B, CodeLlama-13B, and StarCoder - on a dataset of 216 Java test methods containing developer-written assertion messages. We find that Codestral-22B achieves the highest quality score of 2.76 out of 5 using a human-like evaluation approach, compared to 3.24 for manually written messages. Our ablation study shows that including descriptive test comments further improves Codestral's performance to 2.97, highlighting the critical role of context in generating clear assertion messages. Structural analysis demonstrates that all models frequently replicate developers' preferred linguistic patterns. We discuss the limitations of the selected models and conventional text evaluation metrics in capturing diverse assertion message structures. Our benchmark, evaluation results, and discussions provide an essential foundation for advancing automated, context-aware generation of assertion messages in test code.

| **[Is Reuse All You Need? A Systematic Comparison of Regular Expression Composition Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20579v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composing regexes is a common but challenging engineering activity. Software engineers struggle with regex complexity, leading to defects, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. Researchers have proposed tools to synthesize regexes automatically, and recent advances in LLMs have also shown promise in generating regexes. Meanwhile, developers commonly reuse existing regexes from codebases and internet sources. No work to date has compared these various regex composition strategies, leaving software engineers unaware about which to use and researchers uncertain about open problems. We address this gap through a systematic evaluation of regex reuse, formal synthesis, and LLM-based generation strategies. We curate a novel dataset of 901,516 regexes mined from open-source software projects and internet sources (RegexReuseDB), accompanied by a set of 55,448 regex composition tasks defined by a target regex and its corresponding positive and negative string pairs (RegexCompBench). To address the absence of an automated regex reuse formulation, we design and implement reuse-by-example, the first programming by example approach that leverages RegexReuseDB. Our evaluation then benchmarks reuse-by-example, formal synthesizers, and LLMs on many aspects of interest to software engineers, including accuracy, maintainability, computational efficiency, and result diversity. Although all three approaches solve most composition tasks accurately, only reuse-by-example and LLMs excel over the range of metrics we applied, and reuse-by-example in particular offers engineers the variance in candidates that they say they find helpful. Ceteris paribus, prefer the cheaper solution--for regex composition, perhaps reuse is all you need. Our findings provide insights for developers selecting regex composition strategies and inform the design of tools to improve regex reliability in software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverse Engineering User Stories from Code using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19587v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User stories are essential in agile development, yet often missing or outdated in legacy and poorly documented systems. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can automatically recover user stories directly from source code and how prompt design impacts output quality. Using 1,750 annotated C++ snippets of varying complexity, we evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs across six prompting strategies. Results show that all models achieve, on average, an F1 score of 0.8 for code up to 200 NLOC. Our findings show that a single illustrative example enables the smallest model (8B) to match the performance of a much larger 70B model. In contrast, structured reasoning via Chain-of-Thought offers only marginal gains, primarily for larger models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Aware Fuzzing: An Empirical Framework for LLM-Guided, Reasoning-Driven Input Mutation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19533v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security vulnerabilities in Internet-of-Things devices, mobile platforms, and autonomous systems remain critical. Traditional mutation-based fuzzers -- while effectively explore code paths -- primarily perform byte- or bit-level edits without semantic reasoning. Coverage-guided tools such as AFL++ use dictionaries, grammars, and splicing heuristics to impose shallow structural constraints, leaving deeper protocol logic, inter-field dependencies, and domain-specific semantics unaddressed. Conversely, reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) can leverage pretraining knowledge to understand input formats, respect complex constraints, and propose targeted mutations, much like an experienced reverse engineer or testing expert. However, lacking ground truth for "correct" mutation reasoning makes supervised fine-tuning impractical, motivating explorations of off-the-shelf LLMs via prompt-based few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source microservices framework that integrates reasoning LLMs with AFL++ on Google's FuzzBench, tackling asynchronous execution and divergent hardware demands (GPU- vs. CPU-intensive) of LLMs and fuzzers. We evaluate four research questions: (R1) How can reasoning LLMs be integrated into the fuzzing mutation loop? (R2) Do few-shot prompts yield higher-quality mutations than zero-shot? (R3) Can prompt engineering with off-the-shelf models improve fuzzing directly? and (R4) Which open-source reasoning LLMs perform best under prompt-only conditions? Experiments with Llama3.3, Deepseek-r1-Distill-Llama-70B, QwQ-32B, and Gemma3 highlight Deepseek as the most promising. Mutation effectiveness depends more on prompt complexity and model choice than shot count. Response latency and throughput bottlenecks remain key obstacles, offering directions for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clotho: Measuring Task-Specific Pre-Generation Test Adequacy for LLM Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17314v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software increasingly relies on the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), from natural language understanding to program analysis and generation. Yet testing them on specific tasks remains difficult and costly: many prompts lack ground truth, forcing reliance on human judgment, while existing uncertainty and adequacy measures typically require full inference. A key challenge is to assess input adequacy in a way that reflects the demands of the task, ideally before even generating any output. We introduce CLOTHO, a task-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty directly from hidden LLM states. Given a large pool of unlabelled inputs for a specific task, CLOTHO uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to adaptively sample the most informative cases for human labelling. Based on this reference set the GMM can then rank unseen inputs by their likelihood of failure. In our empirical evaluation across eight benchmark tasks and three open-weight LLMs, CLOTHO can predict failures with a ROC-AUC of 0.716, after labelling reference sets that are on average only 5.4% of inputs. It does so without generating any outputs, thereby reducing costs compared to existing uncertainty measures. Comparison of CLOTHO and post-generation uncertainty measures shows that the two approaches complement each other. Crucially, we show that adequacy scores learnt from open-weight LLMs transfer effectively to proprietary models, extending the applicability of the approach. When prioritising test inputs for proprietary models, CLOTHO increases the average number of failing inputs from 18.7 to 42.5 out of 100, compared to random prioritisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Insertion of Flushes and Fences for Persistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19459v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CXL shared memory and persistent memory allow the contents of memory to persist beyond crashes. Stores to persistent or CXL memory are typically not immediately made persistent; developers must manually flush the corresponding cache lines to force the data to be written to the underlying storage. Correctly using flush and fence operations is known to be challenging. While state-of-the-art tools can find missing flush instructions, they often require bug-revealing test cases. No existing tools can ensure the absence of missing flush bugs. In this paper, we present PMRobust, a compiler that automatically inserts flush and fence operations to ensure that code using persistent memory is free from missing flush and fence bugs. PMRobust employs a novel static analysis with optimizations that target newly allocated objects. We have evaluated PMRobust on persistent memory libraries and several persistent memory data structures and measured a geometric mean overhead of 0.26% relative to the original benchmarks with hand-placed flush and fence operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Preliminary Study on the Robustness of Code Generation by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20197v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness is a critical factor for reliable code generation by large language models, yet most evaluations focus on correctness and overlook key issues such as missing input validation and inadequate error handling. In this work, we present the first empirical study of LLM-generated code robustness using the CoderEval benchmark. Evaluating four state-of-the-art code LLMs, we find that 35.2% of their outputs are less robust than human-written code, with over 90% of deficiencies caused by missing conditional checks-70% of which occur in the first line. Interestingly, in 63% of cases where a conditional statement is needed but absent, the "if" token still ranks among the top three predictions, suggesting implicit recognition of control flow. To address these issues, we propose RobGen, a model-agnostic framework that improves robustness without retraining. RobGen combines a line-level intervention checker, which decides whether to adjust logits for each generated line, with token-level conditional logit adjustments to promote essential control structures. Experiments show that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust code by 10%, achieves the highest average Pass@1 (43.57), and adds minimal overhead (+33.4%). As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively enhances the reliability of LLM-generated code across diverse tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model with two RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49%, both beating all general-purpose baselines; on the original HumanEval they score 65.90% and 63.00%. GRPO performs well on basic tasks (44/78) and excels on intermediate ones (41/68), but neither GRPO nor ORPO solves any of the five advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted quantum programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19153v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs serve as verification oracles, capable of reasoning about arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs can be surprisingly effective as verification oracles, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Soundness and Consistency of LLM Agents for Executing Test Cases Written in Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19136v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user interface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually written executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to maintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma). We provide prototype tools, test suites, and results.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19117v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.</p></details> |  |

| **[Prompting for Performance: Exploring LLMs for Configuring Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09790v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems usually provide numerous configuration options that can affect performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, binary size, or bitrate. On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and requires domain expertise in options and their combinations. On the other hand, machine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a high computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations are required. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through prompts. We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT solvers. Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable limitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert knowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other cases. These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and the design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration.</p></details> | ICTAI 2025 |

A critical step in FPGA development is logic synthesis, which enables developers to translate their software designs into hardware net lists, which facilitates the physical implementation of the chip, detailed timing and power analysis, gate-level simulation, test vector generation, and optimization and consistency checking. However, bugs or incorrect implementations in FPGA logic synthesis compilers may lead to unexpected behaviors in target wapplications, posing security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate such bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. The effectiveness of existing works is still limited by its simple, blind mutation strategy. To address this challenge, we propose a guided mutation strategy based on Bayesian optimization called LSC-Fuzz to detect bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. Specifically, LSC-Fuzz consists of three components: the test-program generation component, the Bayesian diversity selection component, and the equivalent check component. By performing test-program generation and Bayesian diversity selection, LSC-Fuzz generates diverse and complex HDL code, thoroughly testing the FPGA logic synthesis compilers using equivalent check to detect bugs. Through three months, LSC-Fuzz has found 16 bugs, 12 of these has been confirmed by official technical support.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks mainly formalize the task as a static, single-turn problem, overlooking the stepwise requirement changes and iterative workflows in real-world software development. This mismatch limits the understanding of how well LLMs can support real-world development workflows. Constructing such iterative benchmarks is challenging due to the lack of public interaction traces and the difficulty of creating discriminative, turn-specific test cases. To bridge this gap, we present SR-Eval, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs on iterative code generation under Stepwise requirements Refinement. SR-Eval spans both function-level and repository-level tasks in Python and Java, enabling fine-grained and progressive evaluation across evolving requirements. The construction of SR-Eval follows a carefully designed pipeline that first leverages a multi-agent-based requirement generation method to simulate the development process and recover the multi-round interaction process from final requirements, then employs a semantic-aware discriminative test case generation component to ensure discriminative and consistent evaluation at each turn. SR-Eval comprises 443 multi-turn tasks and 1,857 questions at both function and repository levels. Using SR-Eval, we evaluate 11 representative LLMs with three prompting strategies that simulate different usage patterns. Results show that iterative code generation under stepwise requirement refinement remains highly challenging: the best-performing model achieves only 22.67% completion rate on function-level tasks and 20.00% on repository-level tasks. We further observe that prompting strategies substantially influence performance, highlighting the need for the development of advanced methods.</p></details> |  |

System and vendor applications that come pre-installed on budget Android devices frequently operate with elevated privileges, yet they receive limited independent examination. To address this gap, we developed a framework that extracts APKs from physical devices and applies static analysis to identify privacy and security issues in embedded software. Our study examined 1,544 APKs collected from seven African smartphones. The analysis revealed that 145 applications (9%) disclose sensitive data, 249 (16%) expose critical components without sufficient safeguards, and many present additional risks: 226 execute privileged or dangerous commands, 79 interact with SMS messages (read, send, or delete), and 33 perform silent installation operations. We also uncovered a vendor-supplied package that appears to transmit device identifiers and location details to an external third party. These results demonstrate that pre-installed applications on widely distributed low-cost devices represent a significant and underexplored threat to user security and privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, submitted (wating for notification)</p></details> |
| **[Application Management in C-ITS: Orchestrating Demand-Driven Deployments and Reconfigurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18793v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicles are becoming increasingly automated and interconnected, enabling the formation of cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) and the use of offboard services. As a result, cloud-native techniques, such as microservices and container orchestration, play an increasingly important role in their operation. However, orchestrating applications in a large-scale C-ITS poses unique challenges due to the dynamic nature of the environment and the need for efficient resource utilization. In this paper, we present a demand-driven application management approach that leverages cloud-native techniques - specifically Kubernetes - to address these challenges. Taking into account the demands originating from different entities within the C-ITS, the approach enables the automation of processes, such as deployment, reconfiguration, update, upgrade, and scaling of microservices. Executing these processes on demand can, for example, reduce computing resource consumption and network traffic. A demand may include a request for provisioning an external supporting service, such as a collective environment model. The approach handles changing and new demands by dynamically reconciling them through our proposed application management framework built on Kubernetes and the Robot Operating System (ROS 2). We demonstrate the operation of our framework in the C-ITS use case of collective environment perception and make the source code of the prototypical framework publicly available at https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/application_manager .</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025), Gold Coast, Australia, November 18-21, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detection of security smells in IaC scripts through semantics-aware code and language processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18790v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure through scripts and tools, streamlining software deployment. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain recurring security misconfigurations, and several detection and mitigation approaches have been proposed. Most of these rely on static analysis, using statistical code representations or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to distinguish insecure configurations from safe code. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enhances static analysis with semantic understanding by jointly leveraging natural language and code representations. Our method builds on two complementary ML models: CodeBERT, to capture semantics across code and text, and LongFormer, to represent long IaC scripts without losing contextual information. We evaluate our approach on misconfiguration datasets from two widely used IaC tools, Ansible and Puppet. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct two ablation studies (removing code text from the natural language input and truncating scripts to reduce context) and compare against four large language models (LLMs) and prior work. Results show that semantic enrichment substantially improves detection, raising precision and recall from 0.46 and 0.79 to 0.92 and 0.88 on Ansible, and from 0.55 and 0.97 to 0.87 and 0.75 on Puppet, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Security smells in infrastructure as code: a taxonomy update beyond the seven sins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18761v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for modern software management, yet security flaws in IaC scripts can have severe consequences, as exemplified by the recurring exploits of Cloud Web Services. Prior work has recognized the need to build a precise taxonomy of security smells in IaC scripts as a first step towards developing approaches to improve IaC security. This first effort led to the unveiling of seven sins, limited by the focus on a single IaC tool as well as by the extensive, and potentially biased, manual effort that was required. We propose, in our work, to revisit this taxonomy: first, we extend the study of IaC security smells to a more diverse dataset with scripts associated with seven popular IaC tools, including Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Pulumi, Saltstack, and Vagrant; second, we bring in some automation for the analysis by relying on an LLM. While we leverage LLMs for initial pattern processing, all taxonomic decisions underwent systematic human validation and reconciliation with established security standards. Our study yields a comprehensive taxonomy of 62 security smell categories, significantly expanding beyond the previously known seven. We demonstrate actionability by implementing new security checking rules within linters for seven popular IaC tools, often achieving 1.00 precision score. Our evolution study of security smells in GitHub projects reveals that these issues persist for extended periods, likely due to inadequate detection and mitigation tools. This work provides IaC practitioners with insights for addressing common security smells and systematically adopting DevSecOps practices to build safer infrastructure code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Language Model Agents to Find Vulnerabilities with CTF-Dojo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18370v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality, execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1, establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locking Down Science Gateways](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18548v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The most recent Linux kernels have a new feature for securing applications: Landlock. Like Seccomp before it, Landlock makes it possible for a running process to give up access to resources. For applications running as Science Gateways, network access is required while starting up MPI, but for the sake of security, it should be taken away prior to the reading of user-supplied parameter files. We explore the usefulness of Landlock by modifying and locking down three mature scientific codes: The Einstein Toolkit (a code that studies the dynamics of relativistic astrophysics, e.g. neutron star collisions), Octo-Tiger (a code for studying the dynamics of non-relativistic astrophysics, e.g. white dwarfs), and FUKA (an initial data solver for relativistic codes). Finally, we implement a fully-functioning FUKA science gateway that relies on Landlock (instead of user authentication) for security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Software Engineering: Foundational Pillars and a Research Roadmap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06216v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex, goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision, outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.</p></details> |  |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo generates repositories averaging 36K Code Lines, roughly 3.9$\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\times$ other baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Petri Nets-based Methods on Automatically Detecting for Concurrency Bugs in Rust Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02754v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rust's memory safety guarantees, notably ownership and lifetime systems, have driven its widespread adoption. Concurrency bugs still occur in Rust programs, and existing detection approaches exhibit significant limitations: static analyzers suffer from context insensitivity and high false positives, while dynamic methods incur prohibitive runtime costs due to exponential path exploration. This paper presents a Petri net-based method for efficient, precise detection of Rust concurrency bugs. The method rests on three pillars: (1) A syntax-preserving program-to-Petri-net transformation tailored for target bug classes; (2) Semantics-preserving state compression via context-aware slicing; (3) Bug detection through efficient Petri net reachability analysis. The core innovation is its rigorous, control-flow-driven modeling of Rust's ownership semantics and synchronization primitives within the Petri net structure, with data operations represented as token movements. Integrated pointer analysis automates alias identification during transformation. Experiments on standard Rust concurrency benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods LockBud and Miri that are both tools of detecting concurrency bugs of Rust programs. Compared to LockBud, our approach reduces false positives by 35.7\% and false negatives by 28.3\% , which is obtained through our precise flow-sensitive pointer analysis. Compared with Miri that is a dynamic analysis tool, although Miri can obtain the same detection results, our method achieves 100% faster verification speed since our method takes a state reduce algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Gaming and esports are key areas influenced by the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions at scale. Tooling simplifies scientific workloads and is essential for developing the gaming and esports research area. In this work, we present ``SC2Tools'', a toolset containing multiple submodules responsible for working with, and producing larger datasets. We provide a modular structure of the implemented tooling, leaving room for future extensions where needed. Additionally, some of the tools are not StarCraft~2 exclusive and can be used with other types of data for dataset creation. The tools we present were leveraged in creating one of the largest StarCraft~2 tournament datasets to date with a separate PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning application programming interface (API) for easy access to the data. We conclude that alleviating the burden of data collection, preprocessing, and custom code development is essential for less technically proficient researchers to engage in the growing gaming and esports research area. Finally, our solution provides some foundational work toward normalizing experiment workflow in StarCraft~2</p></details> |  |

User studies provide rich insights, but are unscalable, while large-scale quantitative signals from logs or in-product ratings are often too shallow or sparse to be reliable. To address this gap, we propose and evaluate a new approach: using sentiment analysis of developer prompts to identify implicit signals of user satisfaction. With an analysis of industrial usage logs of 372 professional developers, we show that this approach can identify a signal in ~8% of all interactions, a rate more than 13 times higher than explicit user feedback, with reasonable accuracy even with an off-the-shelf sentiment analysis approach. This new practical approach to complement existing feedback channels would open up new directions for building a more comprehensive understanding of the developer experience at scale.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies attribute such undesired behavior to flaws in algorithmic design or biased data. However, these studies ignore that discrimination is often the result of a lack of well-specified fairness requirements and their verification. The fact that experts' knowledge about fairness is often implicit makes the task of specifying precise and verifiable fairness requirements difficult. In related domains, such as security engineering, knowledge graphs have been proven to be effective in formalizing knowledge to assist requirements specification and verification. To address the lack of formal mechanisms for specifying and verifying fairness requirements, we propose the development of a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness. In this paper, we discuss the challenges, research questions, and a road map towards addressing the research questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE 33rd International Requirements Engineering Conference Workshops</p></details> |
| **[CoRaCMG: Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Commit Message Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18337v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commit messages play a key role in documenting the intent behind code changes. However, they are often low-quality, vague, or incomplete, limiting their usefulness. Commit Message Generation (CMG) aims to automatically generate descriptive commit messages from code diffs to reduce developers' effort and improve message quality. Although recent advances in LLMs have shown promise in automating CMG, their performance remains limited. This paper aims to enhance CMG performance by retrieving similar diff-message pairs to guide LLMs to generate commit messages that are more precise and informative. We proposed CoRaCMG, a Contextual Retrieval-augmented framework for Commit Message Generation, structured in three phases: (1) Retrieve: retrieving the similar diff-message pairs; (2) Augment: combining them with the query diff into a structured prompt; and (3) Generate: generating commit messages corresponding to the query diff via LLMs. CoRaCMG enables LLMs to learn project-specific terminologies and writing styles from the retrieved diff-message pairs, thereby producing high-quality commit messages. We evaluated our method on various LLMs, including closed-source GPT models and open-source DeepSeek models. Experimental results show that CoRaCMG significantly boosts LLM performance across four metrics (BLEU, Rouge-L, METEOR, and CIDEr). Specifically, DeepSeek-R1 achieves relative improvements of 76% in BLEU and 71% in CIDEr when augmented with a single retrieved example pair. After incorporating the single example pair, GPT-4o achieves the highest improvement rate, with BLEU increasing by 89%. Moreover, performance gains plateau after more than three examples are used, indicating diminishing returns. Further analysis shows that the improvements are attributed to the model's ability to capture the terminologies and writing styles of human-written commit messages from the retrieved example pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 images, 6 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Diagnosing Violations of State-based Specifications in iCFTL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17776v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As modern software systems grow in complexity and operate in dynamic environments, the need for runtime analysis techniques becomes a more critical part of the verification and validation process. Runtime verification monitors the runtime system behaviour by checking whether an execution trace - a sequence of recorded events - satisfies a given specification, yielding a Boolean or quantitative verdict. However, when a specification is violated, such a verdict is often insufficient to understand why the violation happened. To fill this gap, diagnostics approaches aim to produce more informative verdicts. In this paper, we address the problem of generating informative verdicts for violated Inter-procedural Control-Flow Temporal Logic (iCFTL) specifications that express constraints over program variable values. We propose a diagnostic approach based on backward data-flow analysis to statically determine the relevant statements contributing to the specification violation. Using this analysis, we instrument the program to produce enriched execution traces. Using the enriched execution traces, we perform the runtime analysis and identify the statements whose execution led to the specification violation. We implemented our approach in a prototype tool, iCFTL-Diagnostics, and evaluated it on 112 specifications across 10 software projects. Our tool achieves 90% precision in identifying relevant statements for 100 of the 112 specifications. It reduces the number of lines that have to be inspected for diagnosing a violation by at least 90%. In terms of computational cost, iCFTL-Diagnostics generates a diagnosis within 7 min, and requires no more than 25 MB of memory. The instrumentation required to support diagnostics incurs an execution time overhead of less than 30% and a memory overhead below 20%.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments containing hundreds or thousands of available tools, where loading all tools simultaneously is computationally infeasible. We propose and evaluate five distinct architectures that progressively refine the tool selection process, culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool selection with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces tool loading by up to 50% while maintaining task completion accuracy, advancing the path towards truly general-purpose AI agents capable of dynamically adapting to diverse task environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSIL: Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |

Using real-world Google Cluster Data (GCD) workload traces and the AGOCS framework, the study extracts node attributes and task constraints, then analyses them to identify suitable node-task pairings. It focuses on tasks that can be executed on either a single node or fewer than a thousand out of 12.5k nodes in the analysed GCD cluster. Task constraint operators are compacted, pre-processed with one-hot encoding, and used as features in a training dataset. Various ML classifiers, including Artificial Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Ridge Regression, Adaptive Boosting, and Bagging, are fine-tuned and assessed for accuracy and F1-scores. The final ensemble voting classifier model achieved 98% accuracy and a 1.5-1.8% misclassification rate for tasks with a single suitable node.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version of the paper published in IEEE Access (2024).

Originally pioneered by Netflix, CE simulates real-world failures to expose weaknesses before they impact production. In this paper, we present a systematic gray literature review that investigates how industry practitioners have adopted and adapted CE principles over recent years. Analyzing 50 sources published between 2019 and early 2024, we developed a comprehensive classification framework that extends the foundational CE principles into ten distinct concepts. Our study reveals that while the core tenets of CE remain influential, practitioners increasingly emphasize controlled experimentation, automation, and risk mitigation strategies to align with the demands of agile and continuously evolving DevOps pipelines. Our results enhance the understanding of how CE is intended and implemented in practice, and offer guidance for future research and industrial applications aimed at improving system robustness in dynamic production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025</p></details> |

These platforms harness modern UIX paradigms, component-based architectures, and the SaaS model to enable non-experts to build software. The widespread adoption of single-page applications (SPAs), driven by these frameworks, has shaped low-code tools to deliver responsive, client side experiences. In parallel, many modeling platforms have moved to the cloud, adopting either server-centric architectures (e.g., GSLP) or client-side intelligence via SPA frameworks, anchoring core components in JavaScript or TypeScript. Within this context, OCL.js, a JavaScript-based implementation of the Object Constraint Language, offers a web aligned approach to model validation, yet faces challenges such as partial standard coverage, limited adoption, and weak integration with modern front-end toolchains. In this paper, we explore JSX, a declarative, functional subset of JavaScript/TypeScript used in the React ecosystem, as an alternative to constraint expression in SaaS-based modeling environments. Its component-oriented structure supports inductive definitions for syntax, code generation, and querying. Through empirical evaluation, we compare JSX-based constraints with OCL.js across representative modeling scenarios. Results show JSX provides broader expressiveness and better fits front-end-first architectures, indicating a promising path for constraint specification in modern modeling tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 Figures, Joint Proceedings of the STAF 2025 Workshops: OCL, OOPSLE, LLM4SE, ICMM, AgileMDE, AI4DPS, and TTC.

| **[Agentic AI for Software: thoughts from Software Engineering community](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17343v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt. At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team. Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents. Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p></details> | 4 pages |

As software systems get more complex and the threat landscape evolves, traditional text-based and numerical methods for analyzing and interpreting security concerns become increasingly ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review existing research and create a comprehensive taxonomy of software security visualization techniques through literature, categorizing these techniques into four types: graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualization. This systematic review explores over 60 recent key research papers in software security visualization, highlighting its key issues, recent advancements, and prospective future research directions. From the comprehensive analysis, the two main areas were distinctly highlighted as extensive software development visualization, focusing on advanced methods for depicting software architecture: operational security visualization and cybersecurity visualization. The findings highlight the necessity for innovative visualization techniques that adapt to the evolving security landscape, with practical implications for enhancing threat detection, improving security response strategies, and guiding future research.</p></details> |  |

This prominent role positions prompts as potential SE artifacts that, like other artifacts, may require systematic development, documentation, and maintenance. However, little is known about how prompts are actually used and managed in LLM-integrated workflows, what challenges practitioners face, and whether the benefits of systematic prompt management outweigh the associated effort. To address this gap, we propose a research programme that (a) characterizes current prompt practices, challenges, and influencing factors in SE; (b) analyzes prompts as software artifacts, examining their evolution, traceability, reuse, and the trade-offs of systematic management; and (c) develops and empirically evaluates evidence-based guidelines for managing prompts in LLM-integrated workflows. As a first step, we conducted an exploratory survey with 74 software professionals from six countries to investigate current prompt practices and challenges. The findings reveal that prompt usage in SE is largely ad-hoc: prompts are often refined through trial-and-error, rarely reused, and shaped more by individual heuristics than standardized practices. These insights not only highlight the need for more systematic approaches to prompt management but also provide the empirical foundation for the subsequent stages of our research programme.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 26th International Conference on Product-Focused Software Process Improvement (PROFES 2025)</p></details> |

However, these capabilities are still limited compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model, such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.</p></details> | 22 pages |

However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code. These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We experiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p></details> |  |

To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.</p></details> |  |

While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification, we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Python Programming Education with an AI-Powered Code Helper: Design, Implementation, and Impact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20518v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Protocol Testing with I/O Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20308v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating software tests faces two fundamental problems. First, one needs to _generate inputs_ that are syntactically and semantically correct, yet sufficiently diverse to cover behavior. Second, one needs an _oracle_ to _check outputs_ whether a test case is correct or not. Both problems become apparent in _protocol testing_, where inputs are messages exchanged between parties, and outputs are the responses of these parties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protocol testing that combines input generation and output checking in a single framework. We introduce _I/O grammars_ as the first means to _completely_ specify the syntax and semantics of protocols, including messages, states, and interactions. Our implementation, based on the FANDANGO framework, takes a single I/O grammar, and can act as a _test generator_, as a _mock object_, and as an _oracle_ for a _client_, a _server_, or both (or actually any number of parties), a versatility not found in any existing tool or formalism. User-defined _constraints}_can have the generator focus on arbitrary protocol features; $k$-path guidance systematically covers states, messages, responses, and value alternatives in a unified fashion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several protocols, including DNS, FTP, and SMTP. We demonstrate that I/O grammars can specify advanced protocol features correctly and completely, while also enabling output validation of the programs under test. In its evaluation, we find that systematic coverage of the I/O grammar results in much quicker coverage of the input and response spaces (and thus functionality) compared to the random-based state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages |

This paper introduces a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based approach for the verifiable execution of business processes while preserving confidentiality. We integrate ZK virtual machines (zkVMs) into business process management engines through a comprehensive system architecture and a prototypical implementation. Our approach supports chained verifiable computations through proof compositions. On the example of product carbon footprinting, we model sequential footprinting activities and demonstrate how organizations can prove and verify the integrity of verifiable processes without exposing sensitive information. We assess different ZKP proving variants within process models for their efficiency in proving and verifying, and discuss the practical integration of ZKPs throughout the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle. Our experiment-driven evaluation demonstrates the automation of process verification under given confidentiality constraints.</p></details> |  |

While sampling techniques improve pass@k metrics, hardware engineers need one trustworthy solution rather than uncertain candidates. To bridge this gap, we formulate it as a semantic alignment problem between requirements and Verilog implementations, and propose VCD-RNK, a discriminator model tailored for efficient Verilog code reranking. Specifically, VCD-RNKincorporates Verilog-specific reasoning by distilling expert knowledge across three dimensions: code semantic analysis, test case generation, and functional correctness assessment. By explicitly simulating the above reasoning processes during inference, VCD-RNK effectively avoids computationally intensive test execution in existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

In order to address this, we present a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models were able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2nd ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software, Benchmark & Dataset Track (AIware '25)</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study of Testing Practices in Open Source AI Agent Frameworks and Agentic Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19185v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation model (FM)-based AI agents are rapidly gaining adoption across diverse domains, but their inherent non-determinism and non-reproducibility pose testing and quality assurance challenges. While recent benchmarks provide task-level evaluations, there is limited understanding of how developers verify the internal correctness of these agents during development. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of testing practices in the AI agent ecosystem, analyzing 39 open-source agent frameworks and 439 agentic applications. We identify ten distinct testing patterns and find that novel, agent-specific methods like DeepEval are seldom used (around 1%), while traditional patterns like negative and membership testing are widely adapted to manage FM uncertainty. By mapping these patterns to canonical architectural components of agent frameworks and agentic applications, we uncover a fundamental inversion of testing effort: deterministic components like Resource Artifacts (tools) and Coordination Artifacts (workflows) consume over 70% of testing effort, while the FM-based Plan Body receives less than 5%. Crucially, this reveals a critical blind spot, as the Trigger component (prompts) remains neglected, appearing in around 1% of all tests. Our findings offer the first empirical testing baseline in FM-based agent frameworks and agentic applications, revealing a rational but incomplete adaptation to non-determinism. To address it, framework developers should improve support for novel testing methods, application developers must adopt prompt regression testing, and researchers should explore barriers to adoption. Strengthening these practices is vital for building more robust and dependable AI agents.</p></details> |  |

However, existing automated traceability methods are constrained by the scarcity of training data and challenges in bridging the semantic gap between artifacts. This study aims to address the data scarcity problem in requirements traceability by employing large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation. We propose a novel approach that utilizes prompt-based techniques with LLMs to generate augmented requirement-to-code trace links, thereby enhancing the training dataset. Four LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) were used, employing both zero-shot and few-shot templates. Moreover, we optimized the encoder component of the tracing model to improve its efficiency and adaptability to augmented data. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) proposing and evaluating four prompt templates for data augmentation; (2) providing a comparative analysis of four LLMs for generating trace links; (3) enhancing the model's encoder for improved adaptability to augmented datasets. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances model performance, achieving an F1 score improvement of up to 28.59%, thus demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for practical application.</p></details> |  |

Most existing code-related benchmarks evaluate syntax correctness and execution accuracy, overlooking critical game-specific metrics such as playability, visual aesthetics, and user engagement that are essential for real-world deployment. To address the gap between current LLM capabilities in algorithmic problem-solving and competitive programming versus the comprehensive requirements of practical game development, we present V-GameGym, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,219 high-quality samples across 100 thematic clusters derived from real-world repositories, adopting a novel clustering-based curation methodology to ensure both diversity and structural completeness. Further, we introduce a multimodal evaluation framework with an automated LLM-driven pipeline for visual code synthesis using complete UI sandbox environments. Our extensive analysis reveals that V-GameGym effectively bridges the gap between code generation accuracy and practical game development workflows, providing quantifiable quality metrics for visual programming and interactive element generation.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However, existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages. First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code. Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code retrieval.</p></details> |  |

| **[Byam: Fixing Breaking Dependency Updates with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07522v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) facilitate the integration of third-party dependencies within the code of client applications. However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code. These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We experiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Improved Quantum Software Challenges Classification Approach using Transfer Learning and Explainable AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21068v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a research area practiced by tech firms. Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling, Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%, respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions, i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual developers and vendors are needed.</p></details> |  |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with students.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Red Teaming LLM-based Agents with Model Context Protocol Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21011v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.</p></details> |  |

However, energy estimates during DL training often rely on unverified assumptions. This work addresses that gap by investigating how model architecture and training environment affect energy consumption. We train a variety of computer vision models and collect energy consumption and accuracy metrics to analyze their trade-offs across configurations. Our results show that selecting the right model-training environment combination can reduce training energy consumption by up to 80.68% with less than 2% loss in $F_1$ score. We find a significant interaction effect between model and training environment: energy efficiency improves when GPU computational power scales with model complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that common estimation practices, such as using FLOPs or GPU TDP, fail to capture these dynamics and can lead to substantial errors. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Stable Training Epoch Projection (STEP) and the Pre-training Regression-based Estimation (PRE) methods. Across evaluations, our methods outperform existing tools by a factor of two or more in estimation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 10 figures, under review in Computer Standards & Interfaces journal.

| **[PseudoBridge: Pseudo Code as the Bridge for Better Semantic and Logic Alignment in Code Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20881v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However, existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages. First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code. Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verification Limits Code LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20837v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification, we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Exploring Engagement in Hybrid Meetings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20780v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices, introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks, employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics. Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Issue Types in Open Source Blockchain-based Software Projects with the Transformer-based BERTopic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11451v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain-based software systems are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, yet a systematic understanding of their development challenges remains limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of 497,742 issues mined from 1,209 open-source blockchain projects hosted on GitHub. Employing BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, we identify 49 distinct issue topics and organize them hierarchically into 11 major subcategories. Our analysis reveals that both general software development issues and blockchain-specific concerns are nearly equally represented, with Wallet Management and UI Enhancement emerging as the most prominent topics. We further examine the temporal evolution of issue categories and resolution times, finding that Wallet issues not only dominate in frequency but also exhibit the longest resolution time. Conversely, Mechanisms issues are resolved significantly faster. Issue frequency surged after 2016 with the rise of Ethereum and decentralized applications, but started declining after 2022. These findings enhance our understanding of blockchain software maintenance, informing the development of specialized tools and practices to improve robustness and maintainability.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel programming language topic classification workflow. Our approach combines a multi-label Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a sliding window and voting strategy to enable fine-grained localization of core language concepts such as operator overloading, virtual functions, inheritance, and templates. Trained on the IBM Project CodeNet dataset, our model achieves an average F1 score of 0.90 across topics and 0.75 in code-topic highlight. Our findings contribute empirical insights and a reusable pipeline for researchers and practitioners interested in code analysis and data-driven software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we show progress towards a basic, but portable, runtime environment for developing and executing hybrid quantum-classical programs running in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments enhanced with Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The middleware includes a second layer of scheduling after the main HPC resource manager in order to improve the utilization of the QPU, and extra functionality for observability, monitoring, and admin access. This approach enables managing multiple programming Software Development Kits (SDKs) as first-class citizens in the environment by building on a recently proposed vendor-neutral Quantum Resource Management Interface (QRMI).

| **[Enhancing Python Programming Education with an AI-Powered Code Helper: Design, Implementation, and Impact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20518v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |

Yet these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD). In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142 Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Proceedings of the 2025 Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE '25)</p></details> |
| **[AI-Specific Code Smells: From Specification to Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20491v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code), achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).</p></details> |  |

We conducted a mixed-methods case study in NAV IT, a large public sector agile organization. We analyzed 26,317 unique non-merge commits from 703 of NAV IT's GitHub repositories over a two-year period, focusing on commit-based activity metrics from 25 Copilot users and 14 non-users. The analysis was complemented by survey responses on their roles and perceived productivity, as well as 13 interviews. Our analysis of activity metrics revealed that individuals who used Copilot were consistently more active than non-users, even prior to Copilot's introduction. We did not find any statistically significant changes in commit-based activity for Copilot users after they adopted the tool, although minor increases were observed. This suggests a discrepancy between changes in commit-based metrics and the subjective experience of productivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 59th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Dual-Language General-Purpose Self-Hosted Visual Language and new Textual Programming Language for Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20426v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most visual programming languages (VPLs) are domain-specific, with few general-purpose VPLs like Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). These general-purpose VPLs are developed using textual programming languages and improving them requires textual programming. In this thesis, we designed and developed PWCT2, a dual-language (Arabic/English), general-purpose, self-hosting visual programming language. Before doing so, we specifically designed a textual programming language called Ring for its development. Ring is a dynamically typed language with a lightweight implementation, offering syntax customization features. It permits the creation of domain-specific languages through new features that extend object-oriented programming, allowing for specialized languages resembling Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or Supernova language. The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using the PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is composed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which increases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to develop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the development of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual programming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code generation and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also allows for the conversion of Ring code into visual code, enabling the creation of a self-hosting VPL that can be developed using itself. PWCT2 consists of approximately 92,000 lines of Ring code and comes with 394 visual components. PWCT2 is distributed to many users through the Steam platform and has received positive feedback, On Steam, 1772 users have launched the software, and the total recorded usage time exceeds 17,000 hours, encouraging further research and development.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Advancing Expert Specialization for Better MoE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22323v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per input. However, we observe that the commonly used auxiliary load balancing loss often leads to expert overlap and overly uniform routing, which hinders expert specialization and degrades overall performance during post-training. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective solution that introduces two complementary objectives: (1) an orthogonality loss to encourage experts to process distinct types of tokens, and (2) a variance loss to encourage more discriminative routing decisions. Gradient-level analysis demonstrates that these objectives are compatible with the existing auxiliary loss and contribute to optimizing the training process. Experimental results over various model architectures and across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly enhances expert specialization. Notably, our method improves classic MoE baselines with auxiliary loss by up to 23.79%, while also maintaining load balancing in downstream tasks, without any architectural modifications or additional components.

For that, it examines the design and implementation of a Digital Wallet system developed in Kotlin (for OOP) and Scala (for FP). The comparison is made through a mixed-method approach. The self-ethnographic qualitative analysis provides a side-by-side comparison of both implementations, revealing the perspective of those writing such code. The survey-based quantitative analysis gathers feedback from developers with diverse backgrounds, showing their impressions of those reading this code.

| **[Protocol Testing with I/O Grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20308v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating software tests faces two fundamental problems. First, one needs to _generate inputs_ that are syntactically and semantically correct, yet sufficiently diverse to cover behavior. Second, one needs an _oracle_ to _check outputs_ whether a test case is correct or not. Both problems become apparent in _protocol testing_, where inputs are messages exchanged between parties, and outputs are the responses of these parties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protocol testing that combines input generation and output checking in a single framework. We introduce _I/O grammars_ as the first means to _completely_ specify the syntax and semantics of protocols, including messages, states, and interactions. Our implementation, based on the FANDANGO framework, takes a single I/O grammar, and can act as a _test generator_, as a _mock object_, and as an _oracle_ for a _client_, a _server_, or both (or actually any number of parties), a versatility not found in any existing tool or formalism. User-defined _constraints}_can have the generator focus on arbitrary protocol features; $k$-path guidance systematically covers states, messages, responses, and value alternatives in a unified fashion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several protocols, including DNS, FTP, and SMTP. We demonstrate that I/O grammars can specify advanced protocol features correctly and completely, while also enabling output validation of the programs under test. In its evaluation, we find that systematic coverage of the I/O grammar results in much quicker coverage of the input and response spaces (and thus functionality) compared to the random-based state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages |

This paper introduces a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based approach for the verifiable execution of business processes while preserving confidentiality. We integrate ZK virtual machines (zkVMs) into business process management engines through a comprehensive system architecture and a prototypical implementation. Our approach supports chained verifiable computations through proof compositions. On the example of product carbon footprinting, we model sequential footprinting activities and demonstrate how organizations can prove and verify the integrity of verifiable processes without exposing sensitive information. We assess different ZKP proving variants within process models for their efficiency in proving and verifying, and discuss the practical integration of ZKPs throughout the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle. Our experiment-driven evaluation demonstrates the automation of process verification under given confidentiality constraints.</p></details> |  |

While sampling techniques improve pass@k metrics, hardware engineers need one trustworthy solution rather than uncertain candidates. To bridge this gap, we formulate it as a semantic alignment problem between requirements and Verilog implementations, and propose VCD-RNK, a discriminator model tailored for efficient Verilog code reranking. Specifically, VCD-RNKincorporates Verilog-specific reasoning by distilling expert knowledge across three dimensions: code semantic analysis, test case generation, and functional correctness assessment. By explicitly simulating the above reasoning processes during inference, VCD-RNK effectively avoids computationally intensive test execution in existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

However, these capabilities are still limited compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model, such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Byam: Fixing Breaking Dependency Updates with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07522v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) facilitate the integration of third-party dependencies within the code of client applications. However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code. These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects. Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level. We experiment with five LLMs: Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3. Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates. Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions. Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p></details> |  |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with students.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |
| **[PseudoBridge: Pseudo Code as the Bridge for Better Semantic and Logic Alignment in Code Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20881v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However, existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages. First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code. Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verification Limits Code LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20837v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification, we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel programming language topic classification workflow. Our approach combines a multi-label Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a sliding window and voting strategy to enable fine-grained localization of core language concepts such as operator overloading, virtual functions, inheritance, and templates. Trained on the IBM Project CodeNet dataset, our model achieves an average F1 score of 0.90 across topics and 0.75 in code-topic highlight.

| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |
