| **[Exploring the Garden of Forking Paths in Empirical Software Engineering Research: A Multiverse Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08910v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In empirical software engineering (SE) research, researchers have considerable freedom to decide how to process data, what operationalizations to use, and which statistical model to fit. Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a "garden of forking paths". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions. To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings. This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.</p></details> | Submitte to TOSEM |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v7)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimpleDevQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Development Knowledge QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08867v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Development Knowledge Question Answering (Dev Knowledge QA) task aims to provide natural language answers to knowledge-seeking questions during software development. To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multicalibration for LLM-based Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08810v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI-based code generation becomes widespread, researchers are investigating the calibration of code LLMs - ensuring their confidence scores faithfully represent the true likelihood of code correctness. To do so, we investigate multicalibration, which can capture additional factors about a coding problem, such as complexity, code length, or programming language used. We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our results demonstrate that multicalibration can yield distinct improvements over both uncalibrated token likelihoods (+1.03 in skill score) and baseline calibrations (+0.37 in skill score). We study the influence of the aforementioned factors in ablations, and make our dataset (consisting of code generations, likelihoods, and correctness labels) available for future research on code LLM calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI-SQE 2026 (The 1st International Workshop on AI for Software Quality Evaluation: Judgment, Metrics, Benchmarks, and Beyond)</p></details> |
| **[Polynomiogram: An Integrated Framework for Root Visualization and Generative Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04263v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents the Polynomiogram framework, an integrated computational platform for exploring, visualizing, and generating art from polynomial root systems. The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art. Examples include the use of the platform to generate a natural form resembling a hibiscus flower and to create personalized artwork expressing gratitude toward advances in artificial intelligence and large language models through a tribute composition.</p></details> |  |
| **[RESTifAI: LLM-Based Workflow for Reusable REST API Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08706v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With this paper, we introduce RESTifAI, an LLM-driven approach for generating reusable, CI/CD ready REST API tests, following the happy-path approach. Unlike existing tools that often focus primarily on internal server errors, RESTifAI systematically constructs valid test scenarios (happy paths) and derives negative cases to verify both intended functionality (2xx responses) and robustness against invalid inputs or business-rule violations (4xx responses). The results indicate that RESTifAI performs on par with the latest LLM tools, i.e., AutoRestTest and LogiAgent, while addressing limitations related to reusability, oracle complexity, and integration. To support this, we provide common comparative results and demonstrate the tool's applicability in industrial services. For tool demonstration, please refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vtQo0T0Lo4. RESTifAI is publicly available at https://github.com/casablancahotelsoftware/RESTifAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICSE 2026 Demonstration track</p></details> |
| **[Hallucination to Consensus: Multi-Agent LLMs for End-to-End Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02943v6)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Copilot Agent Mode to Automate Library Migration: A Quantitative Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26699v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However, updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy, across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate (39.75%, median).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 1st International Workshop on Agentic Engineering (AGENT 2026, colocated with ICSE), pages 1-5</p></details> |

Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |

To do so, we investigate multicalibration, which can capture additional factors about a coding problem, such as complexity, code length, or programming language used. We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our results demonstrate that multicalibration can yield distinct improvements over both uncalibrated token likelihoods (+1.03 in skill score) and baseline calibrations (+0.37 in skill score). We study the influence of the aforementioned factors in ablations, and make our dataset (consisting of code generations, likelihoods, and correctness labels) available for future research on code LLM calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI-SQE 2026 (The 1st International Workshop on AI for Software Quality Evaluation: Judgment, Metrics, Benchmarks, and Beyond)</p></details> |

The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art. Examples include the use of the platform to generate a natural form resembling a hibiscus flower and to create personalized artwork expressing gratitude toward advances in artificial intelligence and large language models through a tribute composition.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing tools that often focus primarily on internal server errors, RESTifAI systematically constructs valid test scenarios (happy paths) and derives negative cases to verify both intended functionality (2xx responses) and robustness against invalid inputs or business-rule violations (4xx responses). The results indicate that RESTifAI performs on par with the latest LLM tools, i.e., AutoRestTest and LogiAgent, while addressing limitations related to reusability, oracle complexity, and integration. To support this, we provide common comparative results and demonstrate the tool's applicability in industrial services.

However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |

However, updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy, across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate (39.75%, median).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 1st International Workshop on Agentic Engineering (AGENT 2026, colocated with ICSE), pages 1-5</p></details> |

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a "garden of forking paths". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions. To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings. This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.</p></details> | Submitte to TOSEM |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v7)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</p></details> |  |

To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation.

Unlike existing tools that often focus primarily on internal server errors, RESTifAI systematically constructs valid test scenarios (happy paths) and derives negative cases to verify both intended functionality (2xx responses) and robustness against invalid inputs or business-rule violations (4xx responses). The results indicate that RESTifAI performs on par with the latest LLM tools, i.e., AutoRestTest and LogiAgent, while addressing limitations related to reusability, oracle complexity, and integration. To support this, we provide common comparative results and demonstrate the tool's applicability in industrial services.

However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |

However, updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy, across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate (39.75%, median).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 1st International Workshop on Agentic Engineering (AGENT 2026, colocated with ICSE), pages 1-5</p></details> |

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a "garden of forking paths". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions. To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings. This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.</p></details> | Submitte to TOSEM |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v7)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</p></details> |  |

To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |

To do so, we investigate multicalibration, which can capture additional factors about a coding problem, such as complexity, code length, or programming language used. We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our results demonstrate that multicalibration can yield distinct improvements over both uncalibrated token likelihoods (+1.03 in skill score) and baseline calibrations (+0.37 in skill score).

The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art.

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a "garden of forking paths". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions. To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings. This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.</p></details> | Submitte to TOSEM |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v7)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</p></details> |  |

To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |

To do so, we investigate multicalibration, which can capture additional factors about a coding problem, such as complexity, code length, or programming language used. We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our results demonstrate that multicalibration can yield distinct improvements over both uncalibrated token likelihoods (+1.03 in skill score) and baseline calibrations (+0.37 in skill score). We study the influence of the aforementioned factors in ablations, and make our dataset (consisting of code generations, likelihoods, and correctness labels) available for future research on code LLM calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI-SQE 2026 (The 1st International Workshop on AI for Software Quality Evaluation: Judgment, Metrics, Benchmarks, and Beyond)</p></details> |

The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art. Examples include the use of the platform to generate a natural form resembling a hibiscus flower and to create personalized artwork expressing gratitude toward advances in artificial intelligence and large language models through a tribute composition.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing tools that often focus primarily on internal server errors, RESTifAI systematically constructs valid test scenarios (happy paths) and derives negative cases to verify both intended functionality (2xx responses) and robustness against invalid inputs or business-rule violations (4xx responses). The results indicate that RESTifAI performs on par with the latest LLM tools, i.e., AutoRestTest and LogiAgent, while addressing limitations related to reusability, oracle complexity, and integration. To support this, we provide common comparative results and demonstrate the tool's applicability in industrial services.

However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks.

For this task, we use the Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the proportion of API usage points correctly migrated.

To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |

To do so, we investigate multicalibration, which can capture additional factors about a coding problem, such as complexity, code length, or programming language used. We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our results demonstrate that multicalibration can yield distinct improvements over both uncalibrated token likelihoods (+1.03 in skill score) and baseline calibrations (+0.37 in skill score). We study the influence of the aforementioned factors in ablations, and make our dataset (consisting of code generations, likelihoods, and correctness labels) available for future research on code LLM calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI-SQE 2026 (The 1st International Workshop on AI for Software Quality Evaluation: Judgment, Metrics, Benchmarks, and Beyond)</p></details> |

The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art. Examples include the use of the platform to generate a natural form resembling a hibiscus flower and to create personalized artwork expressing gratitude toward advances in artificial intelligence and large language models through a tribute composition.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing tools that often focus primarily on internal server errors, RESTifAI systematically constructs valid test scenarios (happy paths) and derives negative cases to verify both intended functionality (2xx responses) and robustness against invalid inputs or business-rule violations (4xx responses). The results indicate that RESTifAI performs on par with the latest LLM tools, i.e., AutoRestTest and LogiAgent, while addressing limitations related to reusability, oracle complexity, and integration. To support this, we provide common comparative results and demonstrate the tool's applicability in industrial services.

However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |

However, updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy, across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate (39.75%, median).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 1st International Workshop on Agentic Engineering (AGENT 2026, colocated with ICSE), pages 1-5</p></details> |

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a "garden of forking paths". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions. To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings. This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.</p></details> | Submitte to TOSEM |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v7)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</p></details> |  |

The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art. Examples include the use of the platform to generate a natural form resembling a hibiscus flower and to create personalized artwork expressing gratitude toward advances in artificial intelligence and large language models through a tribute composition.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing tools that often focus primarily on internal server errors, RESTifAI systematically constructs valid test scenarios (happy paths) and derives negative cases to verify both intended functionality (2xx responses) and robustness against invalid inputs or business-rule violations (4xx responses). The results indicate that RESTifAI performs on par with the latest LLM tools, i.e., AutoRestTest and LogiAgent, while addressing limitations related to reusability, oracle complexity, and integration. To support this, we provide common comparative results and demonstrate the tool's applicability in industrial services.

| **[Hallucination to Consensus: Multi-Agent LLMs for End-to-End Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02943v6)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |

However, updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy, across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate (39.75%, median).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 1st International Workshop on Agentic Engineering (AGENT 2026, colocated with ICSE), pages 1-5</p></details> |

| **[Exploring the Garden of Forking Paths in Empirical Software Engineering Research: A Multiverse Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08910v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In empirical software engineering (SE) research, researchers have considerable freedom to decide how to process data, what operationalizations to use, and which statistical model to fit. Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a "garden of forking paths". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions. To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings. This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.</p></details> | Submitte to TOSEM |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v7)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL.</p></details> |  |

To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |

To do so, we investigate multicalibration, which can capture additional factors about a coding problem, such as complexity, code length, or programming language used. We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our results demonstrate that multicalibration can yield distinct improvements over both uncalibrated token likelihoods (+1.03 in skill score) and baseline calibrations (+0.37 in skill score). We study the influence of the aforementioned factors in ablations, and make our dataset (consisting of code generations, likelihoods, and correctness labels) available for future research on code LLM calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI-SQE 2026 (The 1st International Workshop on AI for Software Quality Evaluation: Judgment, Metrics, Benchmarks, and Beyond)</p></details> |
