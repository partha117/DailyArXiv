However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIT: A Tree-Structured Instruction Tuning Approach for LLM-Based Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09400v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the industrial adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks, and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted for publication at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 - Industry Showcase Track</p></details> |
| **[On Developers' Self-Declaration of AI-Generated Code: An Analysis of Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16485v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers, who use them to assist in software development due to their capability to generate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |
| **[A Model-Driven Engineering Approach to AI-Powered Healthcare Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09308v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering (MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable, reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Discl...</summary><p>Disclaimer: This manuscript is currently under review at * MDPI Informatics*</p></details> |
| **[JuliaGrid: An Open-Source Julia-Based Framework for Power System State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18229v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern electric power systems have an increasingly complex structure due to rise in power demand and integration of diverse energy sources. Monitoring these large-scale systems, which relies on efficient state estimation, represents a challenging computational task and requires efficient simulation tools for power system steady-state analyses. Motivated by this observation, we propose JuliaGrid, an open-source framework written in the Julia programming language, designed for high performance execution across multiple platforms. The framework implements observability analysis, weighted least-squares and least-absolute value estimators, bad data analysis, and various algorithms related to phasor measurements. To complete power system analysis, the framework includes power flow and optimal power flow, enabling measurement generation for the state estimation routines. Leveraging computationally efficient algorithms, JuliaGrid solves large-scale systems across all methods, offering competitive performance compared to other open-source tools. It is specifically designed for quasi-steady-state analysis, with automatic detection and reuse of computed data to boost performance. These capabilities are validated on systems with 10000, 20000 and 70000 buses.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

| **[SWE-Arena: An Interactive Platform for Evaluating Foundation Models in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01860v5)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs), particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown significant promise in various software engineering (SE) tasks, including code generation, debugging, and requirement refinement. Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

In this article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, gas 2026 conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |
| **[Traceability and Accountability in Role-Specialized Multi-Agent LLM Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07614v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[HotBugs.jar: A Benchmark of Hot Fixes for Time-Critical Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07529v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework, HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting in Practice: Investigating Software Developers' Use of Generative AI Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06000v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has fundamentally transformed software development. Although prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill, existing research focuses primarily on individual techniques rather than software developers' broader workflows. This study presents a systematic investigation of how software engineers integrate GenAI tools into their professional practice through a large-scale survey examining prompting strategies, conversation patterns, and reliability assessments across various software engineering tasks. We surveyed 91 software engineers, including 72 active GenAI users, to understand AI usage patterns throughout the development process. Our 14 key findings show that while code generation is nearly universal, proficiency strongly correlates with using AI for more nuanced tasks such as debugging and code review, and that developers prefer iterative multi-turn conversations to single-shot prompting. Documentation tasks are perceived as most reliable, while complex code generation and debugging present sizable challenges. Our insights provide an empirical baseline of current developer practices, from simple code generation to deeper workflow integration, with actionable insights for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

Lessons from a Mixed Methods Study of Ansible's Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08678v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have transformed the way IT infrastructure is automated and managed, but their growing adoption has also exposed numerous challenges for practitioners. In this paper, we investigate these challenges through the lens of Ansible, a popular IaC tool. Using a mixed methods approach, we investigate challenges, obstacles, and issues faced by practitioners. We analyze 59,157 posts from Stack Overflow, Reddit, and the Ansible Forum to identify common pain points, complemented by 20 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of varying expertise levels. Based on our findings, we propose four main recommendations to improve Ansible: 1) refactoring to mitigate performance issues, 2) restructuring higher-level language concepts, 3) improved debugging and error reporting tools, and 4) better documentation and learning resources. By highlighting the real-world struggles of Ansible users, we provide actionable insights for tool designers, educators, and the broader IaC community, contributing to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs inherent in IaC tools.</p></details> |  |

While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.</p></details> |  |

Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However, many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging approach should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions with the tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 25th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling 2025)</p></details> |

Understanding software defects in multi-user XR systems is crucial for enhancing system reliability, yet remains underexplored. To fill the gap, this paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of multi-user XR defects, analyzing 2,649 real-world bug reports from diverse sources, including developer forums, GitHub repositories, and app reviews on mainstream XR app stores. Through rigorous qualitative analysis using iterative open coding, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies multi-user XR bugs along three dimensions: Symptom Manifestation, Root Cause Origin, and Consequence Severity. Our findings reveal that synchronization inconsistencies and avatar-related anomalies are the most prevalent symptoms, while network/synchronization logic defects and session management flaws emerge as dominant root causes. Critically, over 34% of analyzed bugs lead to severe consequences that fundamentally break the shared experience, including system crashes, persistent disconnections, and complete interaction breakdowns, etc. We also identify concerning privacy and health implications unique to multi-user XR contexts. Based on our findings of defect analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for developers, platform vendors, and researchers. Our results demonstrate that multi-user XR systems face distinct challenges at the intersection of distributed systems, real-time 3D interaction, and immersive experiences, necessitating specialized approaches to testing, debugging, and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |
| **[Vibe Coding in Practice: Motivations, Challenges, and a Future Outlook -- a Grey Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00328v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools are transforming software development, especially for novice and non-software developers, by enabling them to write code and build applications faster and with little to no human intervention. Vibe coding is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code. Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101 practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools' outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers, particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping, but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.</p></details> |  |

We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches. Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJjFfnxUx0.</p></details> |  |
| **[TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.</p></details> |  |

Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress (V2)</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence-Guided Concolic Testing of Transformer Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23806v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an {influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible, pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring, compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that (i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration, and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering potential utility for debugging and model auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Specific Instruction: A Longitudinal Study on Debugging Skill Acquisition and Retention for Novice Programmers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22420v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug localization is a critical skill, yet novices often lack systematic approaches. Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps; the impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week longitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract guidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that pairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4). Forty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5). Each session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element containing a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to completion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and strategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to completion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other groups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p < 0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other groups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses showed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants internalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that context-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger retention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions produced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized performance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may bridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more equitable path for novices.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (25 pages for the paper, rest pages are references and appendix). 4 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[SecureAgentBench: Benchmarking Secure Code Generation under Realistic Vulnerability Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22097v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents (SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions, (ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step toward more reliable software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods (code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by 19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and to provide insights for its practical application.</p></details> |  |

Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |

Effective system-level testing is challenging due to the vast scenario space, the absence of reliable test oracles, and the need for practically applicable and interpretable test cases. We present CoCoMagic, a novel automated test case generation method that combines metamorphic testing, differential testing, and advanced search-based techniques to identify behavioral divergences between versions of autonomous systems. CoCoMagic formulates test generation as a constrained cooperative co-evolutionary search, evolving both source scenarios and metamorphic perturbations to maximize differences in violations of predefined metamorphic relations across versions. Constraints and population initialization strategies guide the search toward realistic, relevant scenarios. An integrated interpretability approach aids in diagnosing the root causes of divergences. We evaluate CoCoMagic on an end-to-end ADS, InterFuser, within the Carla virtual simulator. Results show significant improvements over baseline search methods, identifying up to 287\% more distinct high-severity behavioral differences while maintaining scenario realism. The interpretability approach provides actionable insights for developers, supporting targeted debugging and safety assessment. CoCoMagic offers an efficient, effective, and interpretable way for the differential testing of evolving autonomous systems across versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |

Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Who is Introducing the Failure? Automatically Attributing Failures of Multi-Agent Systems via Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13782v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model Powered Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are increasingly employed to automate complex real-world problems, such as programming and scientific discovery. Despite their promising, MASs are not without their flaws. However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent actions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive, posing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge this gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution approach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and abstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to estimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that each agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a novel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor groups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to account for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns within the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations against 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior performance by outperforming all the methods in comparison.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crash Report Enhancement with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13535v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crash reports are central to software maintenance, yet many lack the diagnostic detail developers need to debug efficiently. We examine whether large language models can enhance crash reports by adding fault locations, root-cause explanations, and repair suggestions. We study two enhancement strategies: Direct-LLM, a single-shot approach that uses stack-trace context, and Agentic-LLM, an iterative approach that explores the repository for additional evidence. On a dataset of 492 real-world crash reports, LLM-enhanced reports improve Top-1 problem-localization accuracy from 10.6% (original reports) to 40.2-43.1%, and produce suggested fixes that closely resemble developer patches (CodeBLEU around 56-57%). Both our manual evaluations and LLM-as-a-judge assessment show that Agentic-LLM delivers stronger root-cause explanations and more actionable repair guidance. A user study with 16 participants further confirms that enhanced reports make crashes easier to understand and resolve, with the largest improvement in repair guidance. These results indicate that supplying LLMs with stack traces and repository code yields enhanced crash reports that are substantially more useful for debugging.</p></details> |  |

Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |

A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rethinking Technology Stack Selection with AI Coding Proficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11132v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now an integral part of software development workflows and are reshaping the whole process. Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[ViScratch: Using Large Language Models and Gameplay Videos for Automated Feedback in Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11065v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-based programming environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in programming education, in particular for young learners. While the use of blocks helps prevent syntax errors, semantic bugs remain common and difficult to debug. Existing tools for Scratch debugging rely heavily on predefined rules or user manual inputs, and crucially, they ignore the platform's inherently visual nature. We introduce ViScratch, the first multimodal feedback generation system for Scratch that leverages both the project's block code and its generated gameplay video to diagnose and repair bugs. ViScratch uses a two-stage pipeline: a vision-language model first aligns visual symptoms with code structure to identify a single critical issue, then proposes minimal, abstract syntax tree level repairs that are verified via execution in the Scratch virtual machine. We evaluate ViScratch on a set of real-world Scratch projects against state-of-the-art LLM-based tools and human testers. Results show that gameplay video is a crucial debugging signal: ViScratch substantially outperforms prior tools in both bug identification and repair quality, even without access to project descriptions or goals. This work demonstrates that video can serve as a first-class specification in visual programming environments, opening new directions for LLM-based debugging beyond symbolic code alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Testing and Adapting REST APIs as LLM Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15546v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build autonomous agents that perform complex tasks with external tools, often exposed through APIs in enterprise systems. Direct use of these APIs is difficult due to the complex input schema and verbose responses. Current benchmarks overlook these challenges, leaving a gap in assessing API readiness for agent-driven automation. We present a testing framework that systematically evaluates enterprise APIs when wrapped as Python tools for LLM-based agents. The framework generates data-aware test cases, translates them into natural language instructions, and evaluates whether agents can correctly invoke the tool, handle their inputs, and process its responses. We apply the framework to generate over 2400 test cases across different domains and develop a taxonomy of common errors, including input misinterpretation, output failures, and schema mismatches. We further classify errors to support debugging and tool refinement. Our framework provides a systematic approach to enabling enterprise APIs as reliable tools for agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality, leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging, and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches. Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code, coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators. Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers seeking to balance security with software quality in web application development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Challenging Bug Prediction and Repair Models with Synthetic Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02407v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs are essential in software engineering; many research studies in the past decades have been proposed to detect, localize, and repair bugs in software systems. Effectiveness evaluation of such techniques requires complex bugs, i.e., those that are hard to detect through testing and hard to repair through debugging. From the classic software engineering point of view, a hard-to-repair bug differs from the correct code in multiple locations, making it hard to localize and repair. Hard-to-detect bugs, on the other hand, manifest themselves under specific test inputs and reachability conditions. These two objectives, i.e., generating hard-to-detect and hard-to-repair bugs, are mostly aligned; a bug generation technique can change multiple statements to be covered only under a specific set of inputs. However, these two objectives are conflicting for learning-based techniques: A bug should have a similar code representation to the correct code in the training data to challenge a bug prediction model to distinguish them. The hard-to-repair bug definition remains the same but with a caveat: the more a bug differs from the original code, the more distant their representations are and easier to be detected. We propose BugFarm, to transform arbitrary code into multiple complex bugs. BugFarm leverages LLMs to mutate code in multiple locations (hard-to-repair). To ensure that multiple modifications do not notably change the code representation, BugFarm analyzes the attention of the underlying model and instructs LLMs to only change the least attended locations (hard-to-detect). Our comprehensive evaluation of 435k+ bugs from over 1.9M mutants generated by BUGFARM and two alternative approaches demonstrates our superiority in generating bugs that are hard to detect by learning-based bug prediction approaches and hard-to-repair by state-of-the-art learning-based program repair technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in SCAM 2025</p></details> |

Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIO: Multiverse Debugging in the Face of Input/Output -- Extended Version with Additional Appendices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06845v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution paths within the state space. Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e. states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse, may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is caused by the debugger. This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during regular execution. We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our techniques. As a demonstration of the approach we highlight a color dial built with a Lego Mindstorms motor, and color sensor, providing a tangible example of how our approach enables multiverse debugging for programs running on an STM32 microcontroller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This extended version provides auxiliary material to the article of the same title that will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the PACMPL issue for OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging. While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22 subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs, where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well in repository-level debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures, EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |

Their adoption requires systematic investigation to ensure responsible integration into curricula. Objective: This doctoral research aims to develop a validated framework for integrating LLMs into SE education through a multi-phase process, including taxonomies development, empirical investigation, and case studies. This paper presents the first empirical step. Method: We conducted a pilot repository mining study of 400 GitHub projects, analyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of motivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8] study. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits), software engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming assistance and debugging support (97 hits) were strongly represented. Demotivators, including plagiarism and IP concerns (385 hits), security, privacy and data integrity (87 hits), and over-reliance on AI in learning (39 hits), also appeared prominently. In contrast, demotivators such as challenges in evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded no hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical validation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes, highlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a comprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE education.</p></details> |  |

It typically requires either exhaustive instrumentation, which becomes prohibitively expensive when $v$ is defined within library calls, or repeated executions, which are impractical for non-deterministic programs. In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable. Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8300 data dependencies across three slicing benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves significantly higher accuracy (80.3%, 91.1%, 98.3%) and recall (up to 98.3%) than the best baseline (accuracy: 39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%; recall: 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a dual-slicing regression bug localizer, it identifies 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |

However, the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong, which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that - unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic quantum debugging strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access, Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Repair of C Programs Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01947v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the repair of C programs. We present a framework that integrates spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT. This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoQuIR: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Code Quality-Aware Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11066v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchTrack: A Comprehensive Analysis of ChatGPT's Influence on Pull Request Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07700v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has introduced new dynamics in software development, particularly within pull request workflows. While prior research has examined the quality of AI-generated code, little is known about how developers actually use these suggestions in real-world collaboration. We analyze 338 pull requests from 255 GitHub repositories containing self-admitted ChatGPT usage, including 645 AI-generated snippets and 3,486 developer-authored patches. We introduce PatchTrack, a tool that classifies whether ChatGPT patches were applied, not applied, or not suggested, enabling fine-grained analysis of AI-assisted decisions. Full adoption of ChatGPT code is rare: the median integration rate was 25%. A qualitative analysis of 89 pull requests with integrated patches revealed recurring patterns of structural integration, selective extraction, and iterative refinement, showing that developers typically treat ChatGPT's output as a starting point rather than a final implementation. Even when code was not directly adopted, ChatGPT influenced workflows through conceptual guidance, documentation, and debugging strategies. Integration decisions were shaped by scope, architectural fit, contributor role, and review norms. This study offers empirical insight into how generative AI is used in collaborative software development, showing that its impact extends beyond patch generation to broader decision-making. Our findings inform the design of AI-assisted tools, clarify patch adoption behavior, and support more transparent and effective use of LLMs in practice.</p></details> | 53 pages, 8 figures |

Therefore, effective and efficient debugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However, the teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in indirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer Science (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way. In this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging that interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance aims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper learning experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be integrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. We developed a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization techniques and large language models. Students can use features like the automated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and executed a small-scale, controlled experiment with eight undergraduate CS students. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the systematic guidance. They rated the automated setting of breakpoints as most effective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the breakpoint explanations. In future, we will extend our concept and implementation, and perform more intensive user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE-NIER 2025</p></details> |

Monitoring through logging a long-standing practice in traditional software offers a potential means for auditing ML applications, as logs provide traceable records of system behavior useful for debugging, performance analysis, and continuous auditing. systematically auditing models for compliance or accountability. The findings underscore the need for enhanced logging practices and tooling that systematically integrate responsible AI metrics. Such practices would support the development of auditable, transparent, and ethically responsible ML systems, aligning with growing regulatory requirements and societal expectations. By highlighting specific deficiencies and opportunities, this work provides actionable guidance for both practitioners and tool developers seeking to strengthen the accountability and trustworthiness of ML applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Did I Do Wrong? Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334v4)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025)</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoVerus: Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13082v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has shown its values for many software engineering tasks. Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

Existing agent-based methods often struggle to fully and accurately reproduce implementation details such as mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic. Previous studies show that reflection with explicit feedback improves agent performance. However, current paper reproduction methods fail to effectively adopt this strategy. This gap mainly arises from the diverse paper patterns, complex method modules, and varied configurations encountered in research papers. Motivated by how humans use systematic checklists to efficiently debug complex code, we propose \textbf{RePro}, a \textbf{Re}flective Paper-to-Code \textbf{Repro}duction framework that automatically extracts a paper's fingerprint, referring to a comprehensive set of accurate and atomic criteria serving as high-quality supervisory signals. The framework first generates code based on the extracted information, and then leverages the fingerprint within iterative verification and refinement loop. This approach systematically detects discrepancies and produces targeted revisions to align generated code with the paper's implementation details. Extensive experiments on the PaperBench Code-Dev benchmark have been conducted, RePro achieves 13.0\% performance gap over baselines, and it correctly revises complex logical and mathematical criteria in reflecting, on which the effectiveness is obvious.</p></details> |  |

This problem is especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems. Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations. These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes. Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely accessible to all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICWE 2025, Delft (30 June - 03 July 2025)</p></details> |

| **[Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saving SWE-Bench: A Benchmark Mutation Approach for Realistic Agent Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08996v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios, especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents. Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks. In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents through benchmark mutation techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repository-Aware File Path Retrieval via Fine-Tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08850v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern codebases make it hard for developers and AI coding assistants to find the right source files when answering questions like "How does this feature work?" or "Where was the bug introduced?" Traditional code search (keyword or IR based) often misses semantic context and cross file links, while large language models (LLMs) understand natural language but lack repository specific detail. We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST) structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs, where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch, and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\% exact match and 93\% recall on held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\% recall, showing scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based code intelligence.</p></details> |  |

To enable the training and evaluation of McMining systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches.

These results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.</p></details> | 58 pages |
| **[Past, Present, and Future of Bug Tracking in the Generative AI Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08005v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting, reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model (LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices for a more efficient, user-centric future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM TOSEM Special Issue: 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap</p></details> |

At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify 16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers. We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 18th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology</p></details> |
| **[Bug Histories as Sources of Compiler Fuzzing Mutators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07834v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from 1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed, validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler fuzzers should leverage.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases. Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a 30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2% code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing, RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both the C and Rust functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages to appear in Proceedings of ASE 2025</p></details> |

Despite their importance, no existing evaluation benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework, HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.</p></details> |  |

Monitoring these large-scale systems, which relies on efficient state estimation, represents a challenging computational task and requires efficient simulation tools for power system steady-state analyses. Motivated by this observation, we propose JuliaGrid, an open-source framework written in the Julia programming language, designed for high performance execution across multiple platforms. The framework implements observability analysis, weighted least-squares and least-absolute value estimators, bad data analysis, and various algorithms related to phasor measurements. To complete power system analysis, the framework includes power flow and optimal power flow, enabling measurement generation for the state estimation routines. Leveraging computationally efficient algorithms, JuliaGrid solves large-scale systems across all methods, offering competitive performance compared to other open-source tools. It is specifically designed for quasi-steady-state analysis, with automatic detection and reuse of computed data to boost performance. These capabilities are validated on systems with 10000, 20000 and 70000 buses.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20854v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |

This paper reports on the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated, concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs (which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX, our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC compiler.</p></details> | <details><summary>examp...</summary><p>examples at https://lair.masot.net/trex .

However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoC2Rust: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.</p></details> |  |

These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone, as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces (API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration. Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2504.13272</p></details> |

Concepts are C++'s way to express constraints on generic code. As an initial example, we provide a simple type system that eliminates narrowing conversions and provides range checking without unnecessary notational or run-time overheads. Concepts are used throughout to provide user-defined extensions to the type system. The aim is to show their utility and the fundamental ideas behind them, rather than to provide a detailed or complete explanation of C++'s language support for generic programming or the extensive support provided by the standard library. Generic programming is an integral part of C++, rather than an isolated sub-language. In particular, key facilities support general programming as well as generic programming (e.g., uniform notation for types, lambdas, variadic templates, and C++26 static reflection). Finally, we give design rationales and origins for key parts of the concept design, including use patterns, the relationship to Object-Oriented Programming, value arguments, notation, concept type-matching, and definition checking.</p></details> |  |

However, this reusability is severely inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular, whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of software languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 6 listings</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43 open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.</p></details> |  |

We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

MacroBench instantiates seven self-hosted sites covering 681 tasks across interaction complexity and targeting difficulty. Our end-to-end protocol validates generated code via static checks, sandboxed execution, and outcome verification (DOM assertions, database snapshots), and includes a safety suite for scraping, spam/abuse, and credential/privacy prompts.

Vibe check is tied to real-world human preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right, read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code evaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this paper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides functional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following capabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30 verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic verifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites, resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following and functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even the strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit clear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional correctness and instruction following correlates the best with human preference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on real-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe check, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that better align with user preferences in coding.</p></details> | Preprint |

Traditionally, developers must resolve these warnings manually. Because this process is tedious, developers sometimes ignore warnings, leading to an accumulation of warnings and a degradation of code quality. This paper presents CodeCureAgent, an approach that harnesses LLM-based agents to automatically analyze, classify, and repair static analysis warnings. Unlike previous work, our method does not follow a predetermined algorithm. Instead, we adopt an agentic framework that iteratively invokes tools to gather additional information from the codebase (e.g., via code search) and edit the codebase to resolve the warning. CodeCureAgent detects and suppresses false positives, while fixing true positives when identified. We equip CodeCureAgent with a three-step heuristic to approve patches: (1) build the project, (2) verify that the warning disappears without introducing new warnings, and (3) run the test suite. We evaluate CodeCureAgent on a dataset of 1,000 SonarQube warnings found in 106 Java projects and covering 291 distinct rules. Our approach produces plausible fixes for 96.8% of the warnings, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline approaches by 30.7% and 29.2% in plausible-fix rate, respectively. Manual inspection of 291 cases reveals a correct-fix rate of 86.3%, showing that CodeCureAgent can reliably repair static analysis warnings. The approach incurs LLM costs of about 2.9 cents (USD) and an end-to-end processing time of about four minutes per warning. We envision CodeCureAgent helping to clean existing codebases and being integrated into CI/CD pipelines to prevent the accumulation of static analysis warnings.</p></details> |  |

We report early results from a pilot intervention integrated into a SaaS company's onboarding program: a five-session course introducing systems thinking and Labelled Transition System (LTS) modelling. Participants articulated their understanding of product behaviour using a structured template and completed matched pre- and post-assessments. Of 35 new hires, 31 provided paired records for analysis. Across the full cohort, gains were small and not statistically significant. However, participants below the median on the pre-test improved by 15 percentage points on average (statistically significant), while those above the median regressed slightly (not statistically significant). Course feedback indicated high engagement and perceived applicability. These results suggest that short, modelling-focused onboarding interventions can accelerate comprehension for less-prepared new hires. At the same time, they point to the need for differentiated pathways for stronger participants, and to the potential for companies to adopt such interventions at scale as a low-cost complement to existing onboarding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COMPUTE 2025 as short paper</p></details> |

Despite their importance, the proposal process is resource-intensive and often leads to contributor frustration, especially when proposals are declined without clear feedback. Yet, the reasons behind proposal rejection remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities to streamline the process or guide contributors effectively. This study investigates the characteristics and outcomes of proposals in the Go programming language to understand why proposals are declined and how such outcomes might be anticipated. We conduct a mixed-method empirical study on 1,091 proposals submitted to the Go project. We quantify proposal outcomes, build a taxonomy of decline reasons, and evaluate large language models (LLMs) for predicting these outcomes. We find that proposals are more often declined than accepted, and resolution typically takes over a month. Only 14.7% of declined proposals are ever resubmitted. Through qualitative coding, we identify nine key reasons for proposal decline, such as duplication, limited use cases, or violations of project principles. This taxonomy can help contributors address issues in advance, e.g., checking for existing alternatives can reduce redundancy. We also demonstrate that GPT-based models can predict decline decisions early in the discussion (F1 score = 0.71 with partial comments), offering a practical tool for prioritizing review effort. Our findings reveal inefficiencies in the proposal process and highlight actionable opportunities for improving both contributor experience and reviewer workload by enabling early triage and guiding contributors to strengthen their proposals using a structured understanding of past decline reasons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Software Engineering Agents: A Study of Thought-Action-Result Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18824v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate complex software engineering tasks, such as program repair and issue resolution. These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: RepairAgent, AutoCodeRover, and OpenHands. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2,822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics, such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence of thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust autonomous software engineering agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACCEP...</summary><p>ACCEPTED FOR ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |
| **[Automated Discovery of Test Oracles for Database Management Systems Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06663v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since 2020, automated testing for Database Management Systems (DBMSs) has flourished, uncovering hundreds of bugs in widely-used systems. A cornerstone of these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to generate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the consistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be automated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and instantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards fully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity, they are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug reports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM invocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and economical. To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core concept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing placeholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a placeholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate pairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This equivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure soundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are instantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by LLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and evaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously unknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already fixed by the developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing and Mitigating Surface Bias in Code Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15397v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, reliable and effective code evaluation metrics (CEMs) have become crucial for progress across several software engineering tasks. While popular benchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated code, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs provide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its functional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on reporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness, the causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this work, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs, revealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code functionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these CEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally dissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this gap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117 code pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a functional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to perform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through differential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and, at the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order of magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show significant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines. Finally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to LoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to surface bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Program Repair of Uncompilable Student Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06187v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling. Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents, including GPT-5 (OpenAI), Claude 3.5 Haiku (Anthropic), and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google), under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students' original structure and logic. We find that while all three LLMs are capable of producing compilable repairs, their behavior diverges in how well they preserve students' control flow and code structure, which affects their pedagogical utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Green Code: Prompting Small Language Models for Energy-Efficient Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09947v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing concern about the environmental impact of large language models (LLMs) in software development, particularly due to their high energy use and carbon footprint. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a more sustainable alternative, requiring fewer computational resources while remaining effective for fundamental programming tasks. In this study, we investigate whether prompt engineering can improve the energy efficiency of SLMs in code generation. We evaluate four open-source SLMs, StableCode-Instruct-3B, Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, CodeLlama-7B-Instruct, and Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct, across 150 Python problems from LeetCode, evenly distributed into easy, medium, and hard categories. Each model is tested under four prompting strategies: role prompting, zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT). For every generated solution, we measure runtime, memory usage, and energy consumption, comparing the results with a human-written baseline. Our findings show that CoT prompting provides consistent energy savings for Qwen2.5-Coder and StableCode-3B, while CodeLlama-7B and Phi-3-Mini-4K fail to outperform the baseline under any prompting strategy. These results highlight that the benefits of prompting are model-dependent and that carefully designed prompts can guide SLMs toward greener software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Is Better For Reducing Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Pinning or Floating?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08609v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning} as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common. We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable dependencies.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE 2025 |

Unlike most existing approaches that treat individual seeds as tasks, DynamiQ leverages structural information from the program's call graph to define tasks and continuously refines task allocation using runtime feedback. This design significantly reduces redundant exploration and enhances fuzzing efficiency at scale. Built on top of the state-of-the-art LibAFL framework, DynamiQ incorporates several practical optimizations in both task allocation and task-aware fuzzing. Evaluated on 12 real-world targets from OSS-Fuzz and FuzzBench over 25,000 CPU hours, DynamiQ outperforms state-of-the-art parallel fuzzers in both code coverage and vulnerability discovery, uncovering 9 previously unknown bugs in widely used and extensively fuzzed open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLSemanticsBench: Large Language Models As Programming Language Interpreters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03415v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) excel at code reasoning, a natural question arises: can an LLM execute programs (i.e., act as an interpreter) purely based on a programming language's formal semantics? If so, it will enable rapid prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs could serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of their robust semantics understanding. We release the benchmark and the supporting code at https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/PLSemanticsBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vul-R2: A Reasoning LLM for Automated Vulnerability Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05480v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data, they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2) Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results) to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses additional challenges for model training.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

| **[VerifyThisBench: Generating Code, Specifications, and Proofs All at Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19271v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in code generation, but many existing benchmarks are approaching saturation and offer little guarantee on the trustworthiness of the generated programs. To improve visibility into model reasoning on formal correctness, we introduce VerifyThisBench, a new benchmark that evaluates end-to-end program verification from natural language descriptions: models must (i) extract formal specifications, (ii) implement in a verification-aware language, and (iii) construct machine checkable proofs. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as o3-mini, achieve a pass rate of less than 4%, with many outputs failing to compile. To isolate sources of difficulty, we further propose VerifyThisBenchXS, a relaxed variant in which partial implementations or proofs are provided. Across nine models and seven verification tools on both benchmarks, we observe consistent gains with feedback-driven refinement, but overall pass rates remain low, underscoring substantial gaps in formal reasoning. We release the benchmark and the unified evaluation environment to catalyze the verification capabilities for future models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Code Models Suffer from the Dunning-Kruger Effect?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05457v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence, especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is proportionate to the competence of the models.</p></details> |  |

Academic research, industrial projects (e.g., Amazon Braket, IBM Qiskit), and consortiums like 'Quantum Flagship' are striving to develop practically capable and commercially viable quantum computing (QC) systems and technologies. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is viewed as a solution attuned to the philosophy of service-orientation that can offer QC resources and platforms, as utility computing, to individuals and organisations who do not own quantum computers. This research investigates a process-centric and architecture-driven approach to offer a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS - a.k.a quantum service-orientation. We employed a two-phase research method comprising (a) a systematic mapping study and (b) an architecture-based development, first to identify the phases of the quantum service development life cycle and subsequently to integrate these phases into a reference architecture that supports QCaaS. The SMS process retrieved a collection of potentially relevant research literature and based on a multi-step selection and qualitative assessment, we selected 41 peer-reviewed studies to answer three RQs. The RQs investigate (i) demographic details in terms of frequency, types, and trends of research, (ii) phases of quantum service development lifecycle to derive a reference architecture for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of services, and (iii) The results identify a 4-phased development lifecycle along with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations, catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can be integrated in a layered reference architecture to engineer QCaaS.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 10 images, 5 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrofitting Control Flow Graphs in LLVM IR for Auto Vectorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04890v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern processors increasingly rely on SIMD instruction sets, such as AVX and RVV, to significantly enhance parallelism and computational performance. However, production-ready compilers like LLVM and GCC often fail to fully exploit available vectorization opportunities due to disjoint vectorization passes and limited extensibility. Although recent attempts in heuristics and intermediate representation (IR) designs have attempted to address these problems, efficiently simplifying control flow analysis and accurately identifying vectorization opportunities remain challenging tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a novel vectorization pipeline featuring two specialized IR extensions: SIR, which encodes high-level structural information, and VIR, which explicitly represents instruction dependencies through data dependency analysis. Leveraging the detailed dependency information provided by VIR, we develop a flexible and extensible vectorization framework. This approach substantially improves interoperability across vectorization passes and expands the search space for identifying isomorphic instructions, ultimately enhancing both the scope and efficiency of automatic vectorization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed vectorization pipeline achieves significant performance improvements, delivering speedups of up to 53% and 58% compared to LLVM and GCC, respectively.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

Ensuring that GUI implementations fulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering, especially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into development workflows. Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or LLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces, and typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated development agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework that leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification of NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to interpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and execute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector systematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification process, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to iteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code generation in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that unifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for supervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the end-to-end requirements verification process. We evaluated GUISpector on a comprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria annotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection of requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for seamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven development workflows. The video presentation of GUISpector is available at: https://youtu.be/JByYF6BNQeE, showcasing its main capabilities.</p></details> |  |

On a large-scale benchmark of 52,937 tasks, 7Bparameter DLLMs outperform AR-LLMs with a 30% average accuracy improvement achieving a 113% gain on cross-file repair, while maintaining superior efficiency and reduced latency. Our results establish DLLMs as a superior paradigm for SE tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, systematic measurement of governmental OSS adoption remain limited. Research Aim: This study contributes to digital government maturity indexes by analyzing policies and support actions leveraging OSS for software reuse and collaborative development across 16 digitally mature countries, and proposing potential indicators for said indexes. It examines OSS policy formation, stated goals, key actors, and support mechanisms. Methodology: A qualitative approach is used combining desk research of policy documents with semi-structured interviews of government representatives, producing detailed country reports. These are cross-analyzed, focusing on OSS policy promotion, rationale, and implementation support. Results: Policies facilitating OSS reuse are widespread, targeting both inbound acquisition and outbound sharing, and are predominantly governed by central public sector organizations. Policy goals include interoperability, digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency, with security framed both as a risk and strength. Implementation is supported by diverse Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) at multiple government levels, which foster capacity building, resource pooling, and sustainable project governance. Indicators are synthesized and proposed across 14 areas covering policy incentives and design, and implementation and support. Conclusions: OSS is a strategic enabler for public sector digital transformation. Clear policy frameworks, coupled with institutional support such as OSPOs, are essential. International digital maturity frameworks should expand OSS indicators to better guide and assess government adoption and impact.</p></details> | In submission |

When the codomain of $f$ is equipped with a total order, it is easy to specify, implement, and verify generic solutions to this problem. But what if $f$ is affected by uncertainties? What if one seeks values that minimize more than one objective, or if $f$ does not return a single result but a set of possible results, or even a probability distribution? Such situations are common in climate science, economics, and engineering. Developing trustworthy solution methods for optimization under uncertainty requires formulating and answering these questions rigorously, including deciding which order relations to apply in different cases. We show how functional programming can support this task, and apply it to specify and test solution methods for cases where optimization is affected by two conceptually different kinds of uncertainty: value and functorial uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Programming the software for such systems remains a largely manual and tedious process, incurring costs of millions of dollars for extensive facilities. Large language models (LLMs) have been found helpful in generating DCS control logic, resulting in commercial copilot tools. Today, these tools are focused on textual notations, they provide limited automation, and have not been tested on large datasets with realistic test cases. We introduce Spec2Control, a highly automated LLM workflow to generate graphical control logic directly from natural language user requirements. Experiments using an open dataset with 10 control narratives and 65 complex test cases demonstrate that Spec2Control can successfully identify control strategies, can generate 98.6% of correct control strategy connections autonomously, and can save between 94-96% of human labor. Spec2Control is being integrated into commercial ABB engineering tools, but is also available as an open-source variant for independent validation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Based on the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Top Threats to Cloud Computing Deep Dive 2025 Report, our analysis details how standing permissions cause catastrophic cloud breaches. While current security tools are addressing network and API security, the challenge of securing granular data access remains. Removing standing permissions at the data level is as critical as it is at the network level, especially for companies handling valuable data at scale. In this white paper, we introduce an innovative architecture based on on-demand data enclaves to address this gap directly. Our approach enables Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) principles at the data level. We replace static permissions with temporary data contracts that enforce proactive protection. This means separation is built around the data requested on-demand, providing precise access and real time monitoring for individual records instead of datasets. This solution drastically reduces the attack surface, prevents privilege creep, and simplifies auditing, offering a vital path for enterprises to transition to a more secure and resilient data environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, company whitepaper, no journal</p></details> |

However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIT: A Tree-Structured Instruction Tuning Approach for LLM-Based Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09400v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the industrial adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks, and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted for publication at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 - Industry Showcase Track</p></details> |
| **[On Developers' Self-Declaration of AI-Generated Code: An Analysis of Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16485v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers, who use them to assist in software development due to their capability to generate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |
| **[A Model-Driven Engineering Approach to AI-Powered Healthcare Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09308v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering (MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable, reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Discl...</summary><p>Disclaimer: This manuscript is currently under review at * MDPI Informatics*</p></details> |

Monitoring these large-scale systems, which relies on efficient state estimation, represents a challenging computational task and requires efficient simulation tools for power system steady-state analyses. Motivated by this observation, we propose JuliaGrid, an open-source framework written in the Julia programming language, designed for high performance execution across multiple platforms. The framework implements observability analysis, weighted least-squares and least-absolute value estimators, bad data analysis, and various algorithms related to phasor measurements. To complete power system analysis, the framework includes power flow and optimal power flow, enabling measurement generation for the state estimation routines. Leveraging computationally efficient algorithms, JuliaGrid solves large-scale systems across all methods, offering competitive performance compared to other open-source tools. It is specifically designed for quasi-steady-state analysis, with automatic detection and reuse of computed data to boost performance. These capabilities are validated on systems with 10000, 20000 and 70000 buses.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20854v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.</p></details> |  |

These issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation.

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |

This paradigm ensures proactive and efficient care by facilitating the timely exchange of accurate patient information among all stake-holders in the care continuum. The rise of digital technologies and process innovations promises to enhance connected health by integrating various healthcare data sources. This integration aims to personalize care, predict health outcomes, and streamline patient management, though challeng-es remain, particularly in data architecture, application interoperability, and security. Data analytics can provide critical insights for informed decision-making and health co-creation, but solutions must prioritize end-users, including patients and healthcare professionals. This perspective was explored through an agile System Development Lifecycle in an EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated AI-generated solution for managing cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. This paper contributes with a collaborative digital framework integrating stakeholders across the care continuum, leveraging federated big data analytics and artificial intelligence for improved decision-making while ensuring privacy. Analytical capabilities, such as treatment recommendations and adverse event predictions, were validated using real-life data, achieving 70%-90% accuracy in a pilot study with the medical partners, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review at * ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare (HEALTH)*</p></details> |

Yet most current digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial, behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model. Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients. Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems, transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and equitable management.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review at Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM)</p></details> |

Ensuring the correctness of ML libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that PynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 % higher code coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for SSBSE 2025</p></details> |

This paper reports on the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated, concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs (which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX, our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC compiler.</p></details> | <details><summary>examp...</summary><p>examples at https://lair.masot.net/trex .

Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early, practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final predictions.

However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</p></details> |  |

We propose Agentic Services Computing (ASC), a paradigm that reimagines services as autonomous, adaptive, and collaborative agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, acting, and evolving in open and uncertain environments. We organize ASC around a four-phase lifecycle: Design, Deployment, Operation, and Evolution. It is examined through four interwoven research dimensions: (i) perception and context modeling, (ii) autonomous decision-making, (iii) multi-agent collaboration, and (iv) evaluation with alignment and trustworthiness. Rather than functioning as isolated layers, these dimensions evolve together. Contextual grounding supports robust deployment; autonomous reasoning drives real-time action; collaboration emerges from agent interaction; and trustworthiness is maintained as a lifelong, cross-cutting commitment across all lifecycle stages. In developing this framework, we also survey a broad spectrum of representative works that instantiate these ideas across academia and industry, mapping key advances to each phase and dimension of ASC. By integrating foundational principles of services computing with cutting-edge advances in LLM-based agency, ASC offers a unified and forward-looking foundation for building intelligent, accountable, and human-centered service ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saving SWE-Bench: A Benchmark Mutation Approach for Realistic Agent Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08996v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios, especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents. Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks. In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents through benchmark mutation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Taxonomy of Sustainability Requirements for Software Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08990v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems are a significant contributor to global sustainability concerns, demanding that environmental, social, technical, and economic factors be systematically addressed from the initial requirements engineering phase. Although existing research provides various sustainability requirements (SRs), these contributions are often fragmented, specific to certain dimensions, or limited to particular application domains, resulting in a critical lack of a unified, comprehensive taxonomy for the software engineering community. To address this gap, this research conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to extract and organize sustainability requirements from the state-of-the-art. The primary contribution is a comprehensive taxonomy of SRs across the four dimensions of sustainability (environmental, technical, social, and economic). For each identified category, we provide clear definitions, associated metrics, and measures. Furthermore, we depict a correlation matrix that projects the positive and negative influences (synergies and conflicts) among categories across different dimensions. This systematized reference assists both software developers and researchers in effectively formulating, managing, and reconciling trade-offs within sustainable software development.</p></details> | Paper: 7 pages |
| **[SWE-Arena: An Interactive Platform for Evaluating Foundation Models in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01860v5)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs), particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown significant promise in various software engineering (SE) tasks, including code generation, debugging, and requirement refinement. Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |
| **[SEER: Sustainability Enhanced Engineering of Software Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08981v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of software development has significant environmental, technical, social, and economic impacts. Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper: 32 pages, References: 3 pages, Appendix: 13 pages.

| **[EvoC2Rust: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.</p></details> |  |

The graph encodes syntactic relations such as containment, implementation, references, calls, and inheritance, and augments nodes with LLM-derived summaries and vector embeddings. A hybrid retrieval pipeline combines semantic retrieval with graph-aware expansion, and an LLM-based assistant formulates constrained, read-only graph requests and produces human-oriented explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[OrcaLoca: An LLM Agent Framework for Software Issue Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00350v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) agents are revolutionizing Autonomous Software Engineering (ASE), enabling automated coding, problem fixes, and feature improvements. However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repository-Aware File Path Retrieval via Fine-Tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08850v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern codebases make it hard for developers and AI coding assistants to find the right source files when answering questions like "How does this feature work?" or "Where was the bug introduced?" Traditional code search (keyword or IR based) often misses semantic context and cross file links, while large language models (LLMs) understand natural language but lack repository specific detail. We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST) structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs, where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch, and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\% exact match and 93\% recall on held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\% recall, showing scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based code intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, the reality of video games require its own set of unique debugging techniques such as On-Screen Console, Debug Draws, Debug Camera, Cheats and In-Game Menus, and Data Scrubbing. In this article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, gas 2026 conference submission</p></details> |

These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |

Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone, as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces (API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration. Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2504.13272</p></details> |

Users rarely adjust these options and usually stick to the default values, which may not lead to the best possible results. Tuning an algorithm's hyperparameters is a method to find better hyperparameter values, but it typically comes with a high demand of resources. Meta-heuristic search algorithms -- that effectively solve the test-generation problem -- have been proposed as a solution to also efficiently tune parameters. In this work we explore the use of differential evolution as a means for tuning the hyperparameters of the DynaMOSA and MIO many-objective search algorithms as implemented in the Pynguin framework. Our results show that significant improvement of the resulting test suite's coverage is possible with the tuned DynaMOSA algorithm and that differential evolution is more efficient than basic grid search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 17th Symposium on Search-Based Software Engineering 2025 (SSBSE 2025)</p></details> |

In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Built...</summary><p>Built with love by the BigCode community :)</p></details> |

Existing approaches either fully refactor the codebase or use plugin-based GPU solvers, each facing trade-offs between performance and development effort. In this work, we address the limitations of plugin-based GPU acceleration in OpenFOAM by proposing a repartitioning strategy that better balances CPU matrix assembly and GPU-based linear solves. We present a detailed computational model, describe a novel matrix repartitioning and update procedure, and evaluate its performance on large-scale CFD simulations. Our results show that the proposed method significantly mitigates oversubscription issues, improving solver performance and resource utilization in heterogeneous CPU-GPU environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Workshop: HPC on Heterogeneous Hardware (H3)</p></details> |

Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to 48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.</p></details> | 58 pages |
| **[Platform-Agnostic Modular Architecture for Quantum Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08469v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a platform-agnostic modular architecture that addresses the increasingly fragmented landscape of quantum computing benchmarking by decoupling problem generation, circuit execution, and results analysis into independent, interoperable components. Supporting over 20 benchmark variants ranging from simple algorithmic tests like Bernstein-Vazirani to complex Hamiltonian simulation with observable calculations, the system integrates with multiple circuit generation APIs (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, Cirq) and enables diverse workflows. We validate the architecture through successful integration with Sandia's $\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for multi-GPU HPC simulations. Extensibility of the system is demonstrated by implementing dynamic circuit variants of existing benchmarks and a new quantum reinforcement learning benchmark, which become readily available across multiple execution and analysis modes. Our primary contribution is identifying and formalizing modular interfaces that enable interoperability between incompatible benchmarking frameworks, demonstrating that standardized interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation while preserving optimization flexibility. This architecture has been developed as a key enhancement to the continually evolving QED-C Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for Quantum Computing suite.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that integrates Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings with FAISS-based vector search to deliver context-aware ticket resolution recommendations. The approach embeds historical JIRA tickets, user comments, and linked PR metadata to retrieve semantically similar past cases, which are then synthesized by a Large Language Model (LLM) into grounded and explainable resolution suggestions. The framework contributes a unified pipeline linking JIRA and GitHub data, an embedding and FAISS indexing strategy for heterogeneous software artifacts, and a resolution generation module guided by retrieved evidence. Experimental evaluation using precision, recall, resolution time reduction, and developer acceptance metrics shows that the proposed system significantly improves resolution accuracy, fix quality, and knowledge reuse in modern DevOps environments.</p></details> | 13 Pages |
| **[RA-Gen: A Controllable Code Generation Framework Using ReAct for Multi-Agent Task Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08665v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation models based on large language models (LLMs) have gained wide adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring safety, accuracy, and controllability, especially for complex tasks. Existing methods often lack dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This framework is a multi-agent system designed to enable efficient, precise, and interpretable code generation through dynamic interactions between LLMs and external resources. The framework adopts a collaborative architecture comprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration, a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework's effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8% security rate on the SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faver: Boosting LLM-based RTL Generation with Function Abstracted Verifiable Middleware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08664v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based RTL generation is an interesting research direction, as it holds the potential to liberate the least automated stage in the current chip design. However, due to the substantial semantic gap between high-level specifications and RTL, coupled with limited training data, existing models struggle with generation accuracy. Drawing on human experience, design with verification helps improving accuracy. However, as the RTL testbench data are even more scarce, it is not friendly for LLMs. Although LLMs excel at higher-level languages like Python/C, they have a huge semantic gap from RTL. When implementing the same functionality, Python/C code and hardware code differ significantly in the spatiotemporal granularity, requiring the LLM not only to consider high-level functional semantics but also to ensure the low-level details align with the circuit code. It is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a function abstracted verifiable middleware (Faver) that streamlines RTL verification in LLM-based workflows. By mixing LLM-friendly code structures with a rule-based template, Faver decouples the details of circuit verification, allowing the LLM to focus on the functionality itself. In our experiments on the SFT model and open-source models, Faver improved the model's generation accuracy by up to 14%.</p></details> |  |

Concepts are C++'s way to express constraints on generic code. As an initial example, we provide a simple type system that eliminates narrowing conversions and provides range checking without unnecessary notational or run-time overheads. Concepts are used throughout to provide user-defined extensions to the type system. The aim is to show their utility and the fundamental ideas behind them, rather than to provide a detailed or complete explanation of C++'s language support for generic programming or the extensive support provided by the standard library. Generic programming is an integral part of C++, rather than an isolated sub-language. In particular, key facilities support general programming as well as generic programming (e.g., uniform notation for types, lambdas, variadic templates, and C++26 static reflection). Finally, we give design rationales and origins for key parts of the concept design, including use patterns, the relationship to Object-Oriented Programming, value arguments, notation, concept type-matching, and definition checking.</p></details> |  |

Python has become a popular choice for these applications due to its simplicity and ease of use. Yet high performance sparse kernels in Python remain limited in functionality, especially on modern CPU and GPU architectures. We present pyGinkgo, a lightweight and Pythonic interface to the Ginkgo library, offering high-performance sparse linear algebra support with platform portability across CUDA, HIP, and OpenMP backends. pyGinkgo bridges the gap between high-performance C++ backends and Python usability by exposing Ginkgo's capabilities via Pybind11 and a NumPy and PyTorch compatible interface. We benchmark pyGinkgo's performance against state-of-the-art Python libraries including SciPy, CuPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. Results across hardware from different vendors demonstrate that pyGinkgo consistently outperforms existing Python tools in both sparse matrix vector (SpMV) product and iterative solver performance, while maintaining performance parity with native Ginkgo C++ code. Our work positions pyGinkgo as a compelling backend for sparse machine learning models and scientific workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 54th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'25)</p></details> |

However, this reusability is severely inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular, whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of software languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 6 listings</p></details> |

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools. The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation environments. This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus, extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available, certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT - accepted by the 16th International Modelica and FMI Conference 2025</p></details> |

The ultimate goal is to discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log. Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Past, Present, and Future of Bug Tracking in the Generative AI Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08005v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting, reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model (LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices for a more efficient, user-centric future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM TOSEM Special Issue: 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap</p></details> |
| **[An AUTOSAR-Aligned Architectural Study of Vulnerabilities in Automotive SoC Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07941v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify 16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers. We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 18th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology</p></details> |
| **[LogAction: Consistent Cross-system Anomaly Detection through Logs via Active Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03288v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log-based anomaly detection is a essential task for ensuring the reliability and performance of software systems. However, the performance of existing anomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large volume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches based on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between source and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this paper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on active domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active learning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to train a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the other hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based sampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual labeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different combinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01% F1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art methods by 26.28%.

| **[Bug Histories as Sources of Compiler Fuzzing Mutators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07834v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from 1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed, validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler fuzzers should leverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interleaved Learning and Exploration: A Self-Adaptive Fuzz Testing Framework for MLIR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07815v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) has rapidly become a foundational technology for modern compiler frameworks, enabling extensibility across diverse domains. However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases. Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a 30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2% code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[AppForge: From Assistant to Independent Developer -- Are GPTs Ready for Software Development?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07740v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations, calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation. Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model (GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex, multi-component software engineering challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review.

| **[Propagation-Based Vulnerability Impact Assessment for Software Supply Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01342v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the impact scope and scale is critical for software supply chain vulnerability assessment. However, existing studies face substantial limitations. First, prior studies either work at coarse package-level granularity, producing many false positives, or fail to accomplish whole-ecosystem vulnerability propagation analysis. Second, although vulnerability assessment indicators like CVSS characterize individual vulnerabilities, no metric exists to specifically quantify the dynamic impact of vulnerability propagation across software supply chains. To address these limitations and enable accurate and comprehensive vulnerability impact assessment, we propose a novel approach: (i) a hierarchical worklist-based algorithm for whole-ecosystem and call-graph-level vulnerability propagation analysis and (ii) the Vulnerability Propagation Scoring System (VPSS), a dynamic metric to quantify the scope and evolution of vulnerability impacts in software supply chains. We implement a prototype of our approach in the Java Maven ecosystem and evaluate it on 100 real-world vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective ecosystem-wide vulnerability propagation analysis, and provides a practical, quantitative measure of vulnerability impact through VPSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE'25)</p></details> |
| **[LLM meets ML: Data-efficient Anomaly Detection on Unstable Logs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07467v4)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for \task, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points (pp) in F1 score while using much less labeled data (62.87 pp reduction). When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 pp increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications, except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM) 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM Applications: Current Paradigms and the Next Frontier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04596v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to four major application paradigms: LLM app stores, LLM agents, self-hosted LLM services, and LLM-powered devices. Each has its advantages but also shares common challenges. LLM app stores lower the barrier to development but lead to platform lock-in; LLM agents provide autonomy but lack a unified communication mechanism; self-hosted LLM services enhance control but increase deployment complexity; and LLM-powered devices improve privacy and real-time performance but are limited by hardware. This paper reviews and analyzes these paradigms, covering architecture design, application ecosystem, research progress, as well as the challenges and open problems they face. Based on this, we outline the next frontier of LLM applications, characterizing them through three interconnected layers: infrastructure, protocol, and application. We describe their responsibilities and roles of each layer and demonstrate how to mitigate existing fragmentation limitations and improve security and scalability. Finally, we discuss key future challenges, identify opportunities such as protocol-driven cross-platform collaboration and device integration, and propose a research roadmap for openness, security, and sustainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Android Build Repair: Bridging the Reasoning-Execution Gap in LLM Agents with Domain-Specific Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08640v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43 open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traceability and Accountability in Role-Specialized Multi-Agent LLM Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07614v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g., steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent, with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing, RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both the C and Rust functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages to appear in Proceedings of ASE 2025</p></details> |

Despite their importance, no existing evaluation benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework, HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.</p></details> |  |

MacroBench instantiates seven self-hosted sites covering 681 tasks across interaction complexity and targeting difficulty. Our end-to-end protocol validates generated code via static checks, sandboxed execution, and outcome verification (DOM assertions, database snapshots), and includes a safety suite for scraping, spam/abuse, and credential/privacy prompts. Across 2,636 model-task runs, we observe stratified success: GPT-4o-mini (96.8%), GPT-4o (95.3%), Gemini (89.0%), DeepSeek (83.4%). Models handle simple tasks reliably (91.7%) but fail on complex workflows (0.0%), and none meet production-quality coding practices despite functional completion.

While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers' burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands, job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing adoption as an opportunity.</p></details> | 10 pages, LLM |

Vibe check is tied to real-world human preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right, read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code evaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this paper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides functional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following capabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30 verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic verifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites, resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following and functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even the strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit clear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional correctness and instruction following correlates the best with human preference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on real-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe check, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that better align with user preferences in coding.</p></details> | Preprint |

Current approaches (e.g., SafeCoder) to improve secure code generation suffer from limited and imbalanced datasets, reducing their effectiveness and generalizability. In this work, we present Secure-Instruct, a novel framework that automatically synthesizes high-quality vulnerable and secure code examples, generates fine-tuning instructions, and instruction-tunes LLMs to align task description and secure code generation abilities. We evaluate Secure-Instruct on four representative LLMs using two benchmarks: our own CWEBench and the existing CWEval. CWEBench comprises 93 scenarios on 44 CWEs, all without overlap with Secure-Instruct's synthetic instruction-tuning dataset, while CWEval covers 31 CWEs with 119 manually verified security-critical tasks. We find that Secure-Instruct improves not only the security but also the functional correctness of the generated code. On CWEBench, Secure-Instruct substantially improves secure code generation, giving a 14.3% average increase in secure ratio over the pretrained models and outperforms SafeCoder by 7.6%. On CWEval, Secure-Instruct achieves a 14% increase for CodeLlama-7B and 5.8% for Mistral-7B in Func-Sec@1 over pretrained models, and surpasses SafeCoder by 15.8% and 6.8% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07147v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured, multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover, task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state, (ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process, where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama, Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.</p></details> |  |

They hold transformative potential across clinical and non-clinical domains, from treating disorders to enhancing cognition and performance. Realizing this potential requires navigating complex, interdisciplinary challenges spanning neuroscience, materials science, device engineering, signal processing, computational modelling, and regulatory and ethical frameworks. This Perspective presents a strategic roadmap for neurotechnology development, created by early-career researchers, highlighting their role at the intersection of disciplines and their capacity to bridge traditional silos. We identify five cross-cutting trade-offs that constrain progress across functionality, scalability, adaptability, and translatability, and illustrate how technical domains influence their resolution. Rather than a domain-specific review, we focus on shared challenges and strategic opportunities that transcend disciplines. We propose a unified framework for collaborative innovation and education, highlight ethical and regulatory priorities, and outline a timeline for overcoming key bottlenecks. By aligning technical development with translational and societal needs, this roadmap aims to accelerate equitable, effective, and future-ready adaptive neurotechnologies, guiding coordinated efforts across the global research and innovation community.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeCureAgent: Automatic Classification and Repair of Static Analysis Warnings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11787v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis tools are widely used to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. Traditionally, developers must resolve these warnings manually. Because this process is tedious, developers sometimes ignore warnings, leading to an accumulation of warnings and a degradation of code quality. This paper presents CodeCureAgent, an approach that harnesses LLM-based agents to automatically analyze, classify, and repair static analysis warnings. Unlike previous work, our method does not follow a predetermined algorithm. Instead, we adopt an agentic framework that iteratively invokes tools to gather additional information from the codebase (e.g., via code search) and edit the codebase to resolve the warning. CodeCureAgent detects and suppresses false positives, while fixing true positives when identified. We equip CodeCureAgent with a three-step heuristic to approve patches: (1) build the project, (2) verify that the warning disappears without introducing new warnings, and (3) run the test suite. We evaluate CodeCureAgent on a dataset of 1,000 SonarQube warnings found in 106 Java projects and covering 291 distinct rules. Our approach produces plausible fixes for 96.8% of the warnings, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline approaches by 30.7% and 29.2% in plausible-fix rate, respectively. Manual inspection of 291 cases reveals a correct-fix rate of 86.3%, showing that CodeCureAgent can reliably repair static analysis warnings. The approach incurs LLM costs of about 2.9 cents (USD) and an end-to-end processing time of about four minutes per warning. We envision CodeCureAgent helping to clean existing codebases and being integrated into CI/CD pipelines to prevent the accumulation of static analysis warnings.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a detailed experience report on the development of the AI Bill of Materials AIBOM specification, an extension of the ISO/IEC 5962:2021 Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) software bill of materials (SBOM) standard, which captures AI components such as datasets and iterative training artifacts. Framed through the lens of Action Research (AR), we document a global, multi-stakeholder effort involving over 90 contributors and structured AR cycles. The resulting specification was validated through four complementary approaches: alignment with major regulations and ethical standards (e.g., EU AI Act and IEEE 7000 standards), systematic mapping to six industry use cases, semi-structured practitioner interviews, and an industrial case study. Beyond delivering a validated artefact, our paper documents the process of building the AIBOM specification in the wild, and reflects on how it aligns with the AR cycle, and distills lessons that can inform future standardization efforts in the software engineering community.</p></details> |  |

We report early results from a pilot intervention integrated into a SaaS company's onboarding program: a five-session course introducing systems thinking and Labelled Transition System (LTS) modelling. Participants articulated their understanding of product behaviour using a structured template and completed matched pre- and post-assessments. Of 35 new hires, 31 provided paired records for analysis. Across the full cohort, gains were small and not statistically significant. However, participants below the median on the pre-test improved by 15 percentage points on average (statistically significant), while those above the median regressed slightly (not statistically significant). Course feedback indicated high engagement and perceived applicability. These results suggest that short, modelling-focused onboarding interventions can accelerate comprehension for less-prepared new hires. At the same time, they point to the need for differentiated pathways for stronger participants, and to the potential for companies to adopt such interventions at scale as a low-cost complement to existing onboarding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COMPUTE 2025 as short paper</p></details> |

While this rapid growth accelerates innovation, it has simultaneously created significant challenges in model discovery and adoption. Users struggle to navigate this landscape due to inconsistent, incomplete, and imbalanced documentation across platforms. Existing documentation frameworks, such as Model Cards and FactSheets, attempt to standardize reporting but are often static, predominantly qualitative, and lack the quantitative mechanisms needed for rigorous cross-model comparison. This gap exacerbates model underutilization and hinders responsible adoption. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Comprehensive Responsible AI Model Card Framework (CRAI-MCF), a novel approach that transitions from static disclosures to actionable, human-aligned documentation. Grounded in Value Sensitive Design (VSD), CRAI-MCF is built upon an empirical analysis of 240 open-source projects, distilling 217 parameters into an eight-module, value-aligned architecture. Our framework introduces a quantitative sufficiency criterion to operationalize evaluation and enables rigorous cross-model comparison under a unified scheme. By balancing technical, ethical, and operational dimensions, CRAI-MCF empowers practitioners to efficiently assess, select, and adopt LLMs with greater confidence and operational integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

Companies adapt data science lifecycles to their culture to seek productivity and improve their competitiveness among others. Data science lifecycles are fairly an important contributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data science and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are involved in a project. A typical life cycle states that it is a linear or cyclical model that revolves around. It is mostly depicted that it is possible in a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after reaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility, agility and iterative approach to business processes.</p></details> |  |

Despite their importance, the proposal process is resource-intensive and often leads to contributor frustration, especially when proposals are declined without clear feedback. Yet, the reasons behind proposal rejection remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities to streamline the process or guide contributors effectively. This study investigates the characteristics and outcomes of proposals in the Go programming language to understand why proposals are declined and how such outcomes might be anticipated. We conduct a mixed-method empirical study on 1,091 proposals submitted to the Go project. We quantify proposal outcomes, build a taxonomy of decline reasons, and evaluate large language models (LLMs) for predicting these outcomes. We find that proposals are more often declined than accepted, and resolution typically takes over a month. Only 14.7% of declined proposals are ever resubmitted. Through qualitative coding, we identify nine key reasons for proposal decline, such as duplication, limited use cases, or violations of project principles. This taxonomy can help contributors address issues in advance, e.g., checking for existing alternatives can reduce redundancy. We also demonstrate that GPT-based models can predict decline decisions early in the discussion (F1 score = 0.71 with partial comments), offering a practical tool for prioritizing review effort. Our findings reveal inefficiencies in the proposal process and highlight actionable opportunities for improving both contributor experience and reviewer workload by enabling early triage and guiding contributors to strengthen their proposals using a structured understanding of past decline reasons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Software Engineering Agents: A Study of Thought-Action-Result Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18824v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate complex software engineering tasks, such as program repair and issue resolution. These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: RepairAgent, AutoCodeRover, and OpenHands. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2,822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics, such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence of thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust autonomous software engineering agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACCEP...</summary><p>ACCEPTED FOR ASE 2025</p></details> |

Conclusion (In-)Stability in Quantitative Empirical Software Engineering: A Large-Scale Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06844v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Mining software repositories is a popular means to gain insights into a software project's evolution, monitor project health, support decisions and derive best practices. Tools supporting the mining process are commonly applied by researchers and practitioners, but their limitations and agreement are often not well understood. Objective: This study investigates some threats to validity in complex tool pipelines for evolutionary software analyses and evaluates the tools' agreement in terms of data, study outcomes and conclusions for the same research questions. Method: We conduct a lightweight literature review to select three studies on collaboration and coordination, software maintenance and software quality from high-ranked venues, which we formally replicate with four independent, systematically selected mining tools to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the extracted data, analysis results and conclusions. Results: We find that numerous technical details in tool design and implementation accumulate along the complex mining pipelines and can cause substantial differences in the extracted baseline data, its derivatives, subsequent results of statistical analyses and, under specific circumstances, conclusions. Conclusions: Users must carefully choose tools and evaluate their limitations to assess the scope of validity in an adequate way. Reusing tools is recommended. Researchers and tool authors can promote reusability and help reducing uncertainties by reproduction packages and comparative studies following our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2Stories: Evaluating the Alignment Between Stakeholder Interviews and Generated User Stories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08622v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable, source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We present AgentDroid, a novel tool for Android fraudulent application detection based on multi-modal analysis and multi-agent systems. AgentDroid overcomes the limitations of traditional detection methods such as the inability to handle multimodal data and high false alarm rates. It processes Android applications and extracts a series of multi-modal data for analysis. Multiple LLM-based agents with specialized roles analyze the relevant data and collaborate to detect complex fraud effectively. We curated a dataset containing various categories of fraudulent applications and legitimate applications and validated our tool on this dataset. Experimental results indicate that our multi-agent tool based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 91.7% and an F1-Score of 91.68%, outperforming the baseline methods.

Conducting systematic reviews is laborious, especially during the screening or study selection phase, where the number of papers can be overwhelming. During this phase, papers are assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria based on their titles and abstracts. Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform title-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student. While LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid Reviews, which try to expedite the review process. Building on recent research, we developed AiSysRev, an LLM-based screening tool implemented as a web application running in a Docker container. The tool accepts a CSV file containing paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion criteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev supports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual screening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human reviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our findings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy Includes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes. The Boundary cases, where LLMs are prone to errors, highlight the need for human intervention. While LLMs do not replace human judgment in systematic reviews, they can significantly reduce the burden of assessing large volumes of scientific literature.

| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |
| **[Automated Discovery of Test Oracles for Database Management Systems Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06663v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since 2020, automated testing for Database Management Systems (DBMSs) has flourished, uncovering hundreds of bugs in widely-used systems. A cornerstone of these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to generate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the consistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be automated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and instantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards fully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity, they are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug reports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM invocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and economical. To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core concept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing placeholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a placeholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate pairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This equivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure soundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are instantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by LLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and evaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously unknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already fixed by the developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond More Context: How Granularity and Order Drive Code Completion Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06606v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context plays an important role in the quality of code completion, as Large Language Models (LLMs) require sufficient and relevant information to assist developers in code generation tasks. However, composing a relevant context for code completion poses challenges in large repositories: First, the limited context length of LLMs makes it impractical to include all repository files. Second, the quality of generated code is highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant context. In this paper, we present our approach for the ASE 2025 Context Collection Challenge. The challenge entails outperforming JetBrains baselines by designing effective retrieval and context collection strategies. We develop and evaluate a series of experiments that involve retrieval strategies at both the file and chunk levels. We focus our initial experiments on examining the impact of context size and file ordering on LLM performance. Our results show that the amount and order of context can significantly influence the performance of the models. We introduce chunk-based retrieval using static analysis, achieving a 6% improvement over our best file-retrieval strategy and a 16% improvement over the no-context baseline for Python in the initial phase of the competition. Our results highlight the importance of retrieval granularity, ordering and hybrid strategies in developing effective context collection pipelines for real-world development scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Hiring Redefined: An Intelligent Recruitment Management Platform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04437v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Against the backdrop of deepening digital and intelligent transformation in human resource management, traditional recruitment models struggle to fully meet enterprises' growing demand for precise talent acquisition due to limited efficiency, high costs, and information asymmetry. As a vital tool for optimizing recruitment processes, reducing labor and time costs, and enhancing core competitiveness, intelligent recruitment management systems have become an indispensable component of modern organizational talent strategies. Compared with the labor intensive tasks of resume screening, candidate position matching, and interview coordination in traditional manual recruitment, intelligent recruitment systems significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the hiring process through automation and data driven approaches. These systems enable rapid parsing of massive resume volumes, intelligent matching of candidates to positions, and automated scheduling of interview processes. This substantially reduces the workload on human resources departments while improving recruitment quality and response speed. This research leverages the Java technology framework to design and implement an intelligent recruitment management system tailored for campus recruitment scenarios. The system establishes a collaborative platform connecting students, enterprises, and administrators through information technology and intelligent solutions, offering comprehensive functionalities including job posting distribution, resume submission, candidate position matching, and process management. Guided by the vision of Smart Campus Recruitment, the project delivers a more convenient job seeking experience for students and provides enterprises with more efficient talent screening and recruitment management services, thereby driving high quality development in university enterprise collaboration.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIT: A Tree-Structured Instruction Tuning Approach for LLM-Based Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09400v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the industrial adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks, and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted for publication at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 - Industry Showcase Track</p></details> |
| **[A Model-Driven Engineering Approach to AI-Powered Healthcare Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09308v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering (MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable, reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Discl...</summary><p>Disclaimer: This manuscript is currently under review at * MDPI Informatics*</p></details> |
| **[An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20854v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.</p></details> |  |

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |
| **[A Semantic Framework for Patient Digital Twins in Chronic Care](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09134v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized chronic care requires the integration of multimodal health data to enable precise, adaptive, and preventive decision-making. Yet most current digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial, behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model. Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients. Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems, transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and equitable management.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review at Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM)</p></details> |

Ensuring the correctness of ML libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that PynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 % higher code coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for SSBSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cost-Efficient Long Code Translation using LLMs while Leveraging Identifier Replacements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09045v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saving SWE-Bench: A Benchmark Mutation Approach for Realistic Agent Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08996v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios, especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents. Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks. In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents through benchmark mutation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoC2Rust: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.</p></details> |  |

However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.</p></details> |  |

These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |

Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone, as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces (API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration. Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2504.13272</p></details> |

However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIT: A Tree-Structured Instruction Tuning Approach for LLM-Based Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09400v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |

However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early, practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final predictions.

However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</p></details> |  |

We propose Agentic Services Computing (ASC), a paradigm that reimagines services as autonomous, adaptive, and collaborative agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, acting, and evolving in open and uncertain environments. We organize ASC around a four-phase lifecycle: Design, Deployment, Operation, and Evolution. It is examined through four interwoven research dimensions: (i) perception and context modeling, (ii) autonomous decision-making, (iii) multi-agent collaboration, and (iv) evaluation with alignment and trustworthiness. Rather than functioning as isolated layers, these dimensions evolve together. Contextual grounding supports robust deployment; autonomous reasoning drives real-time action; collaboration emerges from agent interaction; and trustworthiness is maintained as a lifelong, cross-cutting commitment across all lifecycle stages. In developing this framework, we also survey a broad spectrum of representative works that instantiate these ideas across academia and industry, mapping key advances to each phase and dimension of ASC. By integrating foundational principles of services computing with cutting-edge advances in LLM-based agency, ASC offers a unified and forward-looking foundation for building intelligent, accountable, and human-centered service ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations.

| **[Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |
| **[A Model-Driven Engineering Approach to AI-Powered Healthcare Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09308v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering (MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable, reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Discl...</summary><p>Disclaimer: This manuscript is currently under review at * MDPI Informatics*</p></details> |

Monitoring these large-scale systems, which relies on efficient state estimation, represents a challenging computational task and requires efficient simulation tools for power system steady-state analyses. Motivated by this observation, we propose JuliaGrid, an open-source framework written in the Julia programming language, designed for high performance execution across multiple platforms. The framework implements observability analysis, weighted least-squares and least-absolute value estimators, bad data analysis, and various algorithms related to phasor measurements. To complete power system analysis, the framework includes power flow and optimal power flow, enabling measurement generation for the state estimation routines. Leveraging computationally efficient algorithms, JuliaGrid solves large-scale systems across all methods, offering competitive performance compared to other open-source tools. It is specifically designed for quasi-steady-state analysis, with automatic detection and reuse of computed data to boost performance. These capabilities are validated on systems with 10000, 20000 and 70000 buses.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20854v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.</p></details> |  |

These issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation.

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |

This paradigm ensures proactive and efficient care by facilitating the timely exchange of accurate patient information among all stake-holders in the care continuum. The rise of digital technologies and process innovations promises to enhance connected health by integrating various healthcare data sources. This integration aims to personalize care, predict health outcomes, and streamline patient management, though challeng-es remain, particularly in data architecture, application interoperability, and security. Data analytics can provide critical insights for informed decision-making and health co-creation, but solutions must prioritize end-users, including patients and healthcare professionals. This perspective was explored through an agile System Development Lifecycle in an EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated AI-generated solution for managing cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. This paper contributes with a collaborative digital framework integrating stakeholders across the care continuum, leveraging federated big data analytics and artificial intelligence for improved decision-making while ensuring privacy. Analytical capabilities, such as treatment recommendations and adverse event predictions, were validated using real-life data, achieving 70%-90% accuracy in a pilot study with the medical partners, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review at * ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare (HEALTH)*</p></details> |

Yet most current digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial, behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model. Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients. Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems, transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and equitable management.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review at Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM)</p></details> |

Ensuring the correctness of ML libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that PynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 % higher code coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for SSBSE 2025</p></details> |

This paper reports on the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated, concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs (which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX, our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC compiler.</p></details> | <details><summary>examp...</summary><p>examples at https://lair.masot.net/trex .

| **[Model-Assisted and Human-Guided: Perceptions and Practices of Software Professionals Using LLMs for Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09058v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have quickly become a central component of modern software development workflows, and software practitioners are increasingly integrating LLMs into various stages of the software development lifecycle. Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early, practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEC$^3$O: Multi-Expert Consensus for Code Time Complexity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09049v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final predictions.

However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Services Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24380v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language model (LLM)-powered agents is transforming services computing, moving it beyond static, request-driven functions toward dynamic, goal-oriented, and socially embedded multi-agent ecosystems. We propose Agentic Services Computing (ASC), a paradigm that reimagines services as autonomous, adaptive, and collaborative agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, acting, and evolving in open and uncertain environments. We organize ASC around a four-phase lifecycle: Design, Deployment, Operation, and Evolution. It is examined through four interwoven research dimensions: (i) perception and context modeling, (ii) autonomous decision-making, (iii) multi-agent collaboration, and (iv) evaluation with alignment and trustworthiness. Rather than functioning as isolated layers, these dimensions evolve together. Contextual grounding supports robust deployment; autonomous reasoning drives real-time action; collaboration emerges from agent interaction; and trustworthiness is maintained as a lifelong, cross-cutting commitment across all lifecycle stages. In developing this framework, we also survey a broad spectrum of representative works that instantiate these ideas across academia and industry, mapping key advances to each phase and dimension of ASC. By integrating foundational principles of services computing with cutting-edge advances in LLM-based agency, ASC offers a unified and forward-looking foundation for building intelligent, accountable, and human-centered service ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saving SWE-Bench: A Benchmark Mutation Approach for Realistic Agent Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08996v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios, especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents. Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks. In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents through benchmark mutation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Taxonomy of Sustainability Requirements for Software Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08990v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems are a significant contributor to global sustainability concerns, demanding that environmental, social, technical, and economic factors be systematically addressed from the initial requirements engineering phase. Although existing research provides various sustainability requirements (SRs), these contributions are often fragmented, specific to certain dimensions, or limited to particular application domains, resulting in a critical lack of a unified, comprehensive taxonomy for the software engineering community. To address this gap, this research conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to extract and organize sustainability requirements from the state-of-the-art. The primary contribution is a comprehensive taxonomy of SRs across the four dimensions of sustainability (environmental, technical, social, and economic). For each identified category, we provide clear definitions, associated metrics, and measures. Furthermore, we depict a correlation matrix that projects the positive and negative influences (synergies and conflicts) among categories across different dimensions. This systematized reference assists both software developers and researchers in effectively formulating, managing, and reconciling trade-offs within sustainable software development.</p></details> | Paper: 7 pages |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |

Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper: 32 pages, References: 3 pages, Appendix: 13 pages.

| **[EvoC2Rust: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.</p></details> |  |

However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms. This paper introduces OrcaLoca, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that OrcaLoca becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33%) on SWE-bench Lite. It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repository-Aware File Path Retrieval via Fine-Tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08850v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern codebases make it hard for developers and AI coding assistants to find the right source files when answering questions like "How does this feature work?" or "Where was the bug introduced?" Traditional code search (keyword or IR based) often misses semantic context and cross file links, while large language models (LLMs) understand natural language but lack repository specific detail. We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST) structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs, where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch, and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\% exact match and 93\% recall on held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\% recall, showing scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based code intelligence.</p></details> |  |

These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |

Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone, as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces (API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration. Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2504.13272</p></details> |

Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIT: A Tree-Structured Instruction Tuning Approach for LLM-Based Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09400v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |
| **[A Model-Driven Engineering Approach to AI-Powered Healthcare Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09308v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering (MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable, reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Discl...</summary><p>Disclaimer: This manuscript is currently under review at * MDPI Informatics*</p></details> |

Monitoring these large-scale systems, which relies on efficient state estimation, represents a challenging computational task and requires efficient simulation tools for power system steady-state analyses. Motivated by this observation, we propose JuliaGrid, an open-source framework written in the Julia programming language, designed for high performance execution across multiple platforms. The framework implements observability analysis, weighted least-squares and least-absolute value estimators, bad data analysis, and various algorithms related to phasor measurements. To complete power system analysis, the framework includes power flow and optimal power flow, enabling measurement generation for the state estimation routines. Leveraging computationally efficient algorithms, JuliaGrid solves large-scale systems across all methods, offering competitive performance compared to other open-source tools. It is specifically designed for quasi-steady-state analysis, with automatic detection and reuse of computed data to boost performance. These capabilities are validated on systems with 10000, 20000 and 70000 buses.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20854v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts. In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v4)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.</p></details> |  |

While randomness can be controlled through deterministic configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation.

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |

Ensuring the correctness of ML libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that PynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 % higher code coverage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for SSBSE 2025</p></details> |

This paper reports on the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated, concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs (which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX, our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC compiler.</p></details> | <details><summary>examp...</summary><p>examples at https://lair.masot.net/trex .

Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early, practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final predictions.

However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saving SWE-Bench: A Benchmark Mutation Approach for Realistic Agent Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08996v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios, especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents. Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks. In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents through benchmark mutation techniques.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |
| **[EvoC2Rust: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Data Enclave Advantage: A New Paradigm for Least-Privileged Data Access in a Zero-Trust World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09494v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cloud infrastructure evolves to support dynamic and distributed workflows, accelerated now by AI-driven processes, the outdated model of standing permissions has become a critical vulnerability. Based on the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Top Threats to Cloud Computing Deep Dive 2025 Report, our analysis details how standing permissions cause catastrophic cloud breaches. While current security tools are addressing network and API security, the challenge of securing granular data access remains. Removing standing permissions at the data level is as critical as it is at the network level, especially for companies handling valuable data at scale. In this white paper, we introduce an innovative architecture based on on-demand data enclaves to address this gap directly. Our approach enables Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) principles at the data level. We replace static permissions with temporary data contracts that enforce proactive protection. This means separation is built around the data requested on-demand, providing precise access and real time monitoring for individual records instead of datasets. This solution drastically reduces the attack surface, prevents privilege creep, and simplifies auditing, offering a vital path for enterprises to transition to a more secure and resilient data environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, company whitepaper, no journal</p></details> |
| **[K-ASTRO: Structure-Aware Adaptation of LLMs for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08067v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software engineering tasks, including code vulnerability detection-a critical area of software security. However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIT: A Tree-Structured Instruction Tuning Approach for LLM-Based Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09400v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Research and Practice in Simulation-based Testing of Industrial Robot Navigation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09396v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key challenge, as traditional testing methods often struggle to cover the full spectrum of operational requirements. This paper presents the industrial adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks, and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted for publication at IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 - Industry Showcase Track</p></details> |
