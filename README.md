| **[Ontology-Driven Model-to-Model Transformation of Workflow Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13661v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proprietary workflow modeling languages such as Smart Forms & Smart Flow hamper interoperability and reuse because they lock process knowledge into closed formats. To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

| **[Live-SWE-agent: Can Software Engineering Agents Self-Evolve on the Fly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13646v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.</p></details> |  |

BIOMERO 2.0 integrates data import, preprocessing, analysis, and workflow monitoring through an OMERO.web plugin and containerized components. The importer subsystem facilitates in-place import using containerized preprocessing and metadata enrichment via forms, while the analyzer subsystem coordinates and tracks containerized analyses on high-performance computing systems via the BIOMERO Python library. All imports and analyses are recorded with parameters, versions, and results, ensuring real-time provenance accessible through integrated dashboards. This dual approach places OMERO at the heart of the bioimaging analysis process: the importer ensures provenance from image acquisition through preprocessing and import into OMERO, while the analyzer records it for downstream processing. These integrated layers enhance OMEROs FAIRification, supporting traceable, reusable workflows for image analysis that bridge the gap between data import, analysis, and sharing.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 25 pages supplemental information; for software, see https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO</p></details> |
| **[Towards Quantum Software for Quantum Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13520v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulation is a leading candidate for demonstrating practical quantum advantage over classical computation, as it is believed to provide exponentially more compute power than any classical system. It offers new means of studying the behaviour of complex physical systems, for which conventionally software-intensive simulation codes based on numerical high-performance computing are used. Instead, quantum simulations map properties and characteristics of subject systems, for instance chemical molecules, onto quantum devices that then mimic the system under study. Currently, the use of these techniques is largely limited to fundamental science, as the overall approach remains tailored for specific problems: We lack infrastructure and modelling abstractions that are provided by the software engineering community for other computational domains. In this paper, we identify critical gaps in the quantum simulation software stack-particularly the absence of general-purpose frameworks for model specification, Hamiltonian construction, and hardware-aware mappings. We advocate for a modular model-driven engineering (MDE) approach that supports different types of quantum simulation (digital and analogue), and facilitates automation, performance evaluation, and reusability. Through an example from high-energy physics, we outline a vision for a quantum simulation framework capable of supporting scalable, cross-platform simulation workflows.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.</p></details> |  |

To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability.

Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.</p></details> |  |

To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

These integrated layers enhance OMEROs FAIRification, supporting traceable, reusable workflows for image analysis that bridge the gap between data import, analysis, and sharing.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 25 pages supplemental information; for software, see https://github.com/Cellular-Imaging-Amsterdam-UMC/NL-BIOMERO</p></details> |
| **[Towards Quantum Software for Quantum Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13520v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulation is a leading candidate for demonstrating practical quantum advantage over classical computation, as it is believed to provide exponentially more compute power than any classical system. It offers new means of studying the behaviour of complex physical systems, for which conventionally software-intensive simulation codes based on numerical high-performance computing are used. Instead, quantum simulations map properties and characteristics of subject systems, for instance chemical molecules, onto quantum devices that then mimic the system under study. Currently, the use of these techniques is largely limited to fundamental science, as the overall approach remains tailored for specific problems: We lack infrastructure and modelling abstractions that are provided by the software engineering community for other computational domains. In this paper, we identify critical gaps in the quantum simulation software stack-particularly the absence of general-purpose frameworks for model specification, Hamiltonian construction, and hardware-aware mappings. We advocate for a modular model-driven engineering (MDE) approach that supports different types of quantum simulation (digital and analogue), and facilitates automation, performance evaluation, and reusability. Through an example from high-energy physics, we outline a vision for a quantum simulation framework capable of supporting scalable, cross-platform simulation workflows.</p></details> |  |
