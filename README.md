In this work, we build upon Zorya, a concolic execution framework that translates Go binaries to Ghidra's P-Code intermediate representation to address these challenges. We added the detection of bugs in concretely not taken paths and a multi-layer filtering mechanism to concentrate symbolic reasoning on panic-relevant paths. Evaluation on five Go vulnerabilities demonstrates that panic-reachability gating achieves 1.8-3.9x speedups when filtering 33-70% of branches, and that Zorya detects all panics while existing tools detect at most two. Function-mode analysis proved essential for complex programs, running roughly two orders of magnitude faster than starting from main. This work establishes that specialized concolic execution can achieve practical vulnerability detection in language ecosystems with runtime safety checks.</p></details> |  |

A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Zorya: Automated Concolic Execution of Single-Threaded Go Binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10799v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Go's adoption in critical infrastructure intensifies the need for systematic vulnerability detection, yet existing symbolic execution tools struggle with Go binaries due to runtime complexity and scalability challenges. In this work, we build upon Zorya, a concolic execution framework that translates Go binaries to Ghidra's P-Code intermediate representation to address these challenges. We added the detection of bugs in concretely not taken paths and a multi-layer filtering mechanism to concentrate symbolic reasoning on panic-relevant paths. Evaluation on five Go vulnerabilities demonstrates that panic-reachability gating achieves 1.8-3.9x speedups when filtering 33-70% of branches, and that Zorya detects all panics while existing tools detect at most two. Function-mode analysis proved essential for complex programs, running roughly two orders of magnitude faster than starting from main. This work establishes that specialized concolic execution can achieve practical vulnerability detection in language ecosystems with runtime safety checks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PACIFIC: a framework for generating benchmarks to check Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10713v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based code assistants have emerged as a powerful application of generative AI, demonstrating impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension. A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks.</p></details> |  |
