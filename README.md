| **[AI-powered Code Review with LLMs: Early Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18496v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel approach to improving software quality and efficiency through a Large Language Model (LLM)-based model designed to review code and identify potential issues. Our proposed LLM-based AI agent model is trained on large code repositories. This training includes code reviews, bug reports, and documentation of best practices. It aims to detect code smells, identify potential bugs, provide suggestions for improvement, and optimize the code. Unlike traditional static code analysis tools, our LLM-based AI agent has the ability to predict future potential risks in the code. This supports a dual goal of improving code quality and enhancing developer education by encouraging a deeper understanding of best practices and efficient coding techniques. Furthermore, we explore the model's effectiveness in suggesting improvements that significantly reduce post-release bugs and enhance code review processes, as evidenced by an analysis of developer sentiment toward LLM feedback. For future work, we aim to assess the accuracy and efficiency of LLM-generated documentation updates in comparison to manual methods. This will involve an empirical study focusing on manually conducted code reviews to identify code smells and bugs, alongside an evaluation of best practice documentation, augmented by insights from developer discussions and code reviews. Our goal is to not only refine the accuracy of our LLM-based tool but also to underscore its potential in streamlining the software development lifecycle through proactive code improvement and education.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track; updated artifact link to point to the right version</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying Uncertainty in Machine Learning-Based Pervasive Systems: Application to Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09775v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent convergence of pervasive computing and machine learning has given rise to numerous services, impacting almost all areas of economic and social activity. However, the use of AI techniques precludes certain standard software development practices, which emphasize rigorous testing to ensure the elimination of all bugs and adherence to well-defined specifications. ML models are trained on numerous high-dimensional examples rather than being manually coded. Consequently, the boundaries of their operating range are uncertain, and they cannot guarantee absolute error-free performance. In this paper, we propose to quantify uncertainty in ML-based systems. To achieve this, we propose to adapt and jointly utilize a set of selected techniques to evaluate the relevance of model predictions at runtime. We apply and evaluate these proposals in the highly heterogeneous and evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The results presented demonstrate the relevance of the approach, and we discuss in detail the assistance provided to domain experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Chain-of-Thought Effectiveness in Code Generation: An Empirical and Information-Theoretic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09679v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on code generation, but the mechanisms by which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps remain unclear. We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model management to support systems engineering workflows using ontology-based knowledge graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09596v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System engineering has been shifting from document-centric to model-based approaches, where assets are becoming more and more digital. Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directional Diffusion-Style Code Editing Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12079v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code pre-trained models have shown promising effectiveness in various software engineering tasks. Among these tasks, many tasks are related to software evolution and/or code editing. However, existing code pre-trained models often overlook the real-world code editing data and the evolutionary nature of the editing process. In this paper, to simulate the step-by-step code editing process of human developers, we propose DivoT5, a pre-trained model based on directional diffusion at the data level. In DivoT5, we adopt two categories of pre-training tasks. The first category is mask and denoising tasks augmented with a diffusion direction representing code evolution. That is, we first apply a noising process to the code snippets before evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to restore the snippets with noise into the code snippets after evolution. The second category is tasks aiming to reinforce the evolutionary direction. That is, we first generate various intermediate versions for each pair of snippets before and after evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to transform the intermediate versions into the snippet after evolution for each pair. We evaluate DivoT5 for two code-editing scenarios and one non-editing scenario using five downstream tasks. Given each downstream task, we fine-tune the pre-trained DivoT5 to evaluate its effectiveness. Our experimental results show that DivoT5 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on most tasks in comparison to models of the same scale (220M), large scale (770M) models in fine-tuning, and billion-scale (6.7B, 8B, ChatGPT) models in few-shot settings. For one code-editing task (i.e., automated code review), DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-small (60M) can even outperform CodeT5-base (220M) and other pre-trained models with 220M parameters except for DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-base (220M).</p></details> |  |

However, the use of AI techniques precludes certain standard software development practices, which emphasize rigorous testing to ensure the elimination of all bugs and adherence to well-defined specifications. ML models are trained on numerous high-dimensional examples rather than being manually coded. Consequently, the boundaries of their operating range are uncertain, and they cannot guarantee absolute error-free performance. In this paper, we propose to quantify uncertainty in ML-based systems. To achieve this, we propose to adapt and jointly utilize a set of selected techniques to evaluate the relevance of model predictions at runtime. We apply and evaluate these proposals in the highly heterogeneous and evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The results presented demonstrate the relevance of the approach, and we discuss in detail the assistance provided to domain experts.</p></details> |  |

We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment.</p></details> |  |

Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directional Diffusion-Style Code Editing Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12079v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code pre-trained models have shown promising effectiveness in various software engineering tasks. Among these tasks, many tasks are related to software evolution and/or code editing. However, existing code pre-trained models often overlook the real-world code editing data and the evolutionary nature of the editing process. In this paper, to simulate the step-by-step code editing process of human developers, we propose DivoT5, a pre-trained model based on directional diffusion at the data level. In DivoT5, we adopt two categories of pre-training tasks. The first category is mask and denoising tasks augmented with a diffusion direction representing code evolution. That is, we first apply a noising process to the code snippets before evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to restore the snippets with noise into the code snippets after evolution. The second category is tasks aiming to reinforce the evolutionary direction. That is, we first generate various intermediate versions for each pair of snippets before and after evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to transform the intermediate versions into the snippet after evolution for each pair. We evaluate DivoT5 for two code-editing scenarios and one non-editing scenario using five downstream tasks. Given each downstream task, we fine-tune the pre-trained DivoT5 to evaluate its effectiveness. Our experimental results show that DivoT5 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on most tasks in comparison to models of the same scale (220M), large scale (770M) models in fine-tuning, and billion-scale (6.7B, 8B, ChatGPT) models in few-shot settings. For one code-editing task (i.e., automated code review), DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-small (60M) can even outperform CodeT5-base (220M) and other pre-trained models with 220M parameters except for DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-base (220M).</p></details> |  |

Our proposed LLM-based AI agent model is trained on large code repositories. This training includes code reviews, bug reports, and documentation of best practices. It aims to detect code smells, identify potential bugs, provide suggestions for improvement, and optimize the code. Unlike traditional static code analysis tools, our LLM-based AI agent has the ability to predict future potential risks in the code. This supports a dual goal of improving code quality and enhancing developer education by encouraging a deeper understanding of best practices and efficient coding techniques. Furthermore, we explore the model's effectiveness in suggesting improvements that significantly reduce post-release bugs and enhance code review processes, as evidenced by an analysis of developer sentiment toward LLM feedback. For future work, we aim to assess the accuracy and efficiency of LLM-generated documentation updates in comparison to manual methods. This will involve an empirical study focusing on manually conducted code reviews to identify code smells and bugs, alongside an evaluation of best practice documentation, augmented by insights from developer discussions and code reviews.

However, the use of AI techniques precludes certain standard software development practices, which emphasize rigorous testing to ensure the elimination of all bugs and adherence to well-defined specifications. ML models are trained on numerous high-dimensional examples rather than being manually coded. Consequently, the boundaries of their operating range are uncertain, and they cannot guarantee absolute error-free performance. In this paper, we propose to quantify uncertainty in ML-based systems. To achieve this, we propose to adapt and jointly utilize a set of selected techniques to evaluate the relevance of model predictions at runtime. We apply and evaluate these proposals in the highly heterogeneous and evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The results presented demonstrate the relevance of the approach, and we discuss in detail the assistance provided to domain experts.</p></details> |  |

We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment.</p></details> |  |

Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directional Diffusion-Style Code Editing Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12079v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code pre-trained models have shown promising effectiveness in various software engineering tasks. Among these tasks, many tasks are related to software evolution and/or code editing. However, existing code pre-trained models often overlook the real-world code editing data and the evolutionary nature of the editing process. In this paper, to simulate the step-by-step code editing process of human developers, we propose DivoT5, a pre-trained model based on directional diffusion at the data level. In DivoT5, we adopt two categories of pre-training tasks. The first category is mask and denoising tasks augmented with a diffusion direction representing code evolution. That is, we first apply a noising process to the code snippets before evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to restore the snippets with noise into the code snippets after evolution. The second category is tasks aiming to reinforce the evolutionary direction. That is, we first generate various intermediate versions for each pair of snippets before and after evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to transform the intermediate versions into the snippet after evolution for each pair. We evaluate DivoT5 for two code-editing scenarios and one non-editing scenario using five downstream tasks. Given each downstream task, we fine-tune the pre-trained DivoT5 to evaluate its effectiveness. Our experimental results show that DivoT5 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on most tasks in comparison to models of the same scale (220M), large scale (770M) models in fine-tuning, and billion-scale (6.7B, 8B, ChatGPT) models in few-shot settings. For one code-editing task (i.e., automated code review), DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-small (60M) can even outperform CodeT5-base (220M) and other pre-trained models with 220M parameters except for DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-base (220M).</p></details> |  |

Our proposed LLM-based AI agent model is trained on large code repositories. This training includes code reviews, bug reports, and documentation of best practices. It aims to detect code smells, identify potential bugs, provide suggestions for improvement, and optimize the code. Unlike traditional static code analysis tools, our LLM-based AI agent has the ability to predict future potential risks in the code. This supports a dual goal of improving code quality and enhancing developer education by encouraging a deeper understanding of best practices and efficient coding techniques. Furthermore, we explore the model's effectiveness in suggesting improvements that significantly reduce post-release bugs and enhance code review processes, as evidenced by an analysis of developer sentiment toward LLM feedback. For future work, we aim to assess the accuracy and efficiency of LLM-generated documentation updates in comparison to manual methods. This will involve an empirical study focusing on manually conducted code reviews to identify code smells and bugs, alongside an evaluation of best practice documentation, augmented by insights from developer discussions and code reviews. Our goal is to not only refine the accuracy of our LLM-based tool but also to underscore its potential in streamlining the software development lifecycle through proactive code improvement and education.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment.</p></details> |  |

Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directional Diffusion-Style Code Editing Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12079v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code pre-trained models have shown promising effectiveness in various software engineering tasks. Among these tasks, many tasks are related to software evolution and/or code editing. However, existing code pre-trained models often overlook the real-world code editing data and the evolutionary nature of the editing process. In this paper, to simulate the step-by-step code editing process of human developers, we propose DivoT5, a pre-trained model based on directional diffusion at the data level. In DivoT5, we adopt two categories of pre-training tasks. The first category is mask and denoising tasks augmented with a diffusion direction representing code evolution. That is, we first apply a noising process to the code snippets before evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to restore the snippets with noise into the code snippets after evolution. The second category is tasks aiming to reinforce the evolutionary direction. That is, we first generate various intermediate versions for each pair of snippets before and after evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to transform the intermediate versions into the snippet after evolution for each pair. We evaluate DivoT5 for two code-editing scenarios and one non-editing scenario using five downstream tasks. Given each downstream task, we fine-tune the pre-trained DivoT5 to evaluate its effectiveness. Our experimental results show that DivoT5 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on most tasks in comparison to models of the same scale (220M), large scale (770M) models in fine-tuning, and billion-scale (6.7B, 8B, ChatGPT) models in few-shot settings. For one code-editing task (i.e., automated code review), DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-small (60M) can even outperform CodeT5-base (220M) and other pre-trained models with 220M parameters except for DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-base (220M).</p></details> |  |

Our proposed LLM-based AI agent model is trained on large code repositories. This training includes code reviews, bug reports, and documentation of best practices. It aims to detect code smells, identify potential bugs, provide suggestions for improvement, and optimize the code. Unlike traditional static code analysis tools, our LLM-based AI agent has the ability to predict future potential risks in the code. This supports a dual goal of improving code quality and enhancing developer education by encouraging a deeper understanding of best practices and efficient coding techniques. Furthermore, we explore the model's effectiveness in suggesting improvements that significantly reduce post-release bugs and enhance code review processes, as evidenced by an analysis of developer sentiment toward LLM feedback. For future work, we aim to assess the accuracy and efficiency of LLM-generated documentation updates in comparison to manual methods. This will involve an empirical study focusing on manually conducted code reviews to identify code smells and bugs, alongside an evaluation of best practice documentation, augmented by insights from developer discussions and code reviews. Our goal is to not only refine the accuracy of our LLM-based tool but also to underscore its potential in streamlining the software development lifecycle through proactive code improvement and education.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, the use of AI techniques precludes certain standard software development practices, which emphasize rigorous testing to ensure the elimination of all bugs and adherence to well-defined specifications. ML models are trained on numerous high-dimensional examples rather than being manually coded. Consequently, the boundaries of their operating range are uncertain, and they cannot guarantee absolute error-free performance. In this paper, we propose to quantify uncertainty in ML-based systems. To achieve this, we propose to adapt and jointly utilize a set of selected techniques to evaluate the relevance of model predictions at runtime. We apply and evaluate these proposals in the highly heterogeneous and evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The results presented demonstrate the relevance of the approach, and we discuss in detail the assistance provided to domain experts.</p></details> |  |

Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment.</p></details> |  |

Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directional Diffusion-Style Code Editing Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12079v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code pre-trained models have shown promising effectiveness in various software engineering tasks. Among these tasks, many tasks are related to software evolution and/or code editing. However, existing code pre-trained models often overlook the real-world code editing data and the evolutionary nature of the editing process. In this paper, to simulate the step-by-step code editing process of human developers, we propose DivoT5, a pre-trained model based on directional diffusion at the data level. In DivoT5, we adopt two categories of pre-training tasks. The first category is mask and denoising tasks augmented with a diffusion direction representing code evolution. That is, we first apply a noising process to the code snippets before evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to restore the snippets with noise into the code snippets after evolution. The second category is tasks aiming to reinforce the evolutionary direction. That is, we first generate various intermediate versions for each pair of snippets before and after evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to transform the intermediate versions into the snippet after evolution for each pair. We evaluate DivoT5 for two code-editing scenarios and one non-editing scenario using five downstream tasks. Given each downstream task, we fine-tune the pre-trained DivoT5 to evaluate its effectiveness. Our experimental results show that DivoT5 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on most tasks in comparison to models of the same scale (220M), large scale (770M) models in fine-tuning, and billion-scale (6.7B, 8B, ChatGPT) models in few-shot settings. For one code-editing task (i.e., automated code review), DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-small (60M) can even outperform CodeT5-base (220M) and other pre-trained models with 220M parameters except for DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-base (220M).</p></details> |  |
